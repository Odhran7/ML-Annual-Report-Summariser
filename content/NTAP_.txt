seasonality 

we have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are typically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from customer orders booked in the same quarter customer orders and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if recurring services and cloud revenue continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues historical seasonal patterns may become less pronounced 

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue 

manufacturing and supply chain 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee fremont california san jose california san antonio texas guadalajara mexico schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we strive to have multiple suppliers qualified to provide critical components where possible and have our products manufactured in a number of locations to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating the implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

competition 

we operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware software and related services offerings cloud digital transformation and artificial intelligence initiatives are driving changes in customer and solution requirements 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve our hybrid cloud solutions primarily compete with legacy it and storage vendors some offer a broad spectrum of products solutions and services and others offer a more limited set of storage and datamanagement products solutions or services additionally public cloud providers offer customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire through capital expenditures we both partner with and compete against cloud providers with our public cloud software and services we rarely see legacy vendors competing in the cloud 

we compete with many companies in the cloud operations marketplace including new companies startups and larger software companies who target developers operations engineering devops and financial engineering finops some companies have single point solutions that compete with one of our services and others are building platforms additionally public cloud providers offer similar services on their own cloud 

we face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business including from both branded and genericproduct competitors 

our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and further increase competitive pressures 

we consider our software innovation cloud integration and technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enables us to provide our customers a full range of expertise before during and after their purchases 

proprietary rights 

we generally rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other individual intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment well over two thousand us patents hundreds of pending us patent applications and many corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries from time to time we may make certain intellectual property available under an open source license our primary trademarks are netapp and the netapp design logo which are registered trademarks in the us and in many other countries in addition we have trademarks and trademark registrations in the us and other countries covering our various product or service names 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers distributors customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to the intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal

 it em 1a risk factors 

the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes 

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and governments around the world and the purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand the rise in cloud usage and commensurate spending is driving customers to search for cloud operations solutions to lower costs and speed development despite these growth drivers our markets could be adversely impacted by customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of substitute products andor services increased storage efficiency andor changing economic and business environments additionally customer requirements are evolving in the nascent cloud operations market which could also adversely impact our opportunity while customers are navigating through their information technology it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also looking for simpler solutions and changing how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud cloud storage it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage 

our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in this report our revenue may decline on a yearoveryear basis as it did in fiscal years 2017 and 2020 the future impact of these trends on both short and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks 

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

new or additional product introductions including new software and cloud offerings such as astra by netapp cloud operations services including spot by netapp and cloud insights and new hardware and allflash storage products including aff a900 subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast and manage the impact of customers’ demand for new products services and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services in addition as existing customers transition from older products and solutions to new software and cloud offerings the transition could take longer than expected or the customer could decide to delay the transition either of which could result in nonrenewal of the new offerings or affect our ability to manage and forecast customer churn and expansion rates for new software and cloud offerings as we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as new or enhanced products and services are introduced we must avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in the introduction of new products services and solutions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products services and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels with a corresponding variety of sales cycles the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners which include public cloud providers this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by fragmentation and rapidly changing technology we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newer public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for application data management for kubernetes some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service provider competitors provide customers storage for their data centers on demand without requiring a capital expenditure which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the increase in the number of employees working remotely has accelerated customer adoption of competitors’ cloud solutions and contributed to increased competition in the market we also now compete in the emerging cloud operations market where growth is being driven by increased customer cloud usage and commensurate spend but customer requirements are still evolving there is no clear leader in this market 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish new business models more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash cloud storage converged infrastructure and cloud operations offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage and cloud operations vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors 

it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as fullstack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in part i item 1 – business of this form 10k 

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our business operating results including our revenue growth and profitability financial condition and cash flows 

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad such as inflation and potential economic recession have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the it market impacted availability of supplies and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs or other barriers to global trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy and higher interest rates could materially adversely impact the demand for our products and our operating results in particular in fiscal 2022 we experienced inflationary pressure and other constraints in our supply chain we are also unable to predict whether increased customer spending on our cloud offerings will continue after the covid19 pandemic consequently these concerns have challenged our business and we expect them to continue to challenge our business for the 

 

foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth 

transition to consumptionbased business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business and as a result may harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased software as a service saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumptionbased offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline 

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relative to our consumption model offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings 

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business 

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure and adverse public health developments in particular the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the unpredictable nature of variants globally and ongoing trade tensions between the us and china could impact our business and operating results for products we manufacture in mexico tensions between the us and mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers or impact pricing or our business and operating results as a result of russia’s actions in the ukraine numerous countries and organizations have imposed sanctions and export controls while businesses including the company have limited or suspended russian operations russia has likewise imposed currency restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions including the nationalization of foreign businesses these actions could impact our supply chain pricing business and operating results and expose us to cyberattacks in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example we acquired seven privately held companies from fiscal 2020 through the end of fiscal 2022 the benefits we have received and expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover or mitigate liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition such as differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy protection controls or contractual limitations of liability make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including reductions announced in each of the fiscal years from 2019 through 2022 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could disrupt our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs or fail to grant equity competitively we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our sales cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines 

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

initiatives intended to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are exposed to credit risks and our investment portfolio may experience fluctuations in market value or returns 

 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments and the returns thereon may fluctuate substantially a resurgence of covid19 unfavorable macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances could result in an economic slowdown and possibly cause a global recession an economic slowdown or increased regional or global economic uncertainty may lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions governments and insurers which could result in a material decline in the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns 

our goals and disclosures related to environmental social and governance esg matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance 

we have established and publicly announced esg goals including our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with a sciencebased target and increasing our representation of women in our global workforce and underrepresented minorities in our us workforce these statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them our failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation financial performance and growth and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities 

our ability to achieve any esg objective is subject to numerous risks many of which are outside of our control including the changing regulatory requirements affecting esg standards or disclosures our ability to recruit develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets the locations and usage of our products and the implications on their greenhouse gas emissions and the success of our organic growth and acquisitions 

standards for tracking and reporting esg matters continue to evolve our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of others this may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between the company and other companies in the same industry in addition our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying measuring and reporting esg metrics including esgrelated disclosures that may be required of public companies by the securities and exchange commission and such standards may change over time which could result in significant revisions to our current goals reported progress in achieving such goals or ability to achieve such goals in the future 

if our esg practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards then our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment business partner acquiror or service provider could be negatively impacted further our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards on a timely basis or at all could have similar negative impacts or expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

risks related to our customers and sales 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past and could negatively affect our revenues in the future 

a significant portion of our net revenues is generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed 

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments in which do not directly participate in particular strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloudbased business however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover 

 

some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies including major cloud providers are also competitors thereby complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

we recently reorganized our sales resources which included changes and additions to our sales leadership team to gain operational efficiencies and improve the alignment of our resources with customer and market opportunities we expect to continue developing our sales organization and gotomarket model towards these goals throughout fiscal 2023 the reorganization of our sales resources and ongoing evolution of our gotomarket model could result in short or longterm disruption of our sales cycles may not produce the efficiencies and benefits desired and could harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including our business unit structure and sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from thirdparty resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities 

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government 

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our operating results including revenues may be harmed 

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements including with respect to data security affirmative action program requirements or covid19 vaccine mandates could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in response to increasing cybersecurity threats the us government has subjected it vendors including us to certain additional requirements as an example the executive order on improving the nation’s cybersecurity eo 14028 released in may 2021 outlines a oneyear plan to address the us government’s software supply chain security for “critical software” while the potential impact of the executive order is still being monitored we could be categorized as a provider of critical software which may increase our compliance costs and delay or prevent our ability to execute contracts with customers including in particular with government entities 

 

if we do not achieve forecasted sales orders in any quarter our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter orders typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of orders consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

our gross margins may vary 

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product software support hardware support and other services offerings increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product software support hardware support and other services offerings could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals 

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience increased losses as potentially more customers are unable to pay all or a portion of their obligations to us particularly in the current environment when access to sources of liquidity may be limited as a result of the global covid19 pandemic beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

risks related to our products and services 

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we do not manufacture certain components used in our products we rely on third parties to manufacture critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

• impacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments including outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• limited number of suppliers for certain components 

• no guarantees of supply and limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

• business legal compliance litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship components in the quantities quality and manner we require and 

 

• disruptions due to floods earthquakes storms and other natural disasters especially those caused by climate change and particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources 

such risks have subjected us and could in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed for example the current global shortage of critical product components has caused us to experience increased prices and extended lead times for certain critical components such as semiconductors the shortage could reduce our flexibility to react to product mix changes and disrupt our production schedule the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business including customer relationships and as a result could harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and supply constraints when industry supply is constrained or the supply chain is disrupted as it has been as a result of the covid19 pandemic our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our business operating results financial condition and cash flows may be harmed 

if a material cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems within our supply chain or on our enduser customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit and sell products and services that store and transmit personal sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personal information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities material cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized use alteration or disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and proceedings and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a material cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information or other material security breach could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues 

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information or our supply chain cybersecurity is compromised and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities 

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years with the potential for such acts heightened as a result of geopolitical activities and the number of employees working remotely due to covid19 security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting it products and businesses in this regard the us government has reported that us sanctions against russia in response to the war in ukraine could lead to an increased threat of cyberattacks against us companies because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems we also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach additionally we 

 

use thirdparty service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data such as saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches 

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media and other online communication forums and services any security incident loss of data or other security breach whether actual or perceived or whether impacting us or our thirdparty service providers could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us 

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media and other online communication forums and services this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business 

failure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security could cause harm to our reputation result in liability and adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to increasing regulation by various federal state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security for example since the effective date of the eu’s general data privacy regulation in 2018 the court of justice of the european union has issued rulings that have impacted how multinational companies must implement that law and the european commission ec has published new regulatory requirements relating to crossborder data transfers applicable to multinational companies like netapp netapp relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of european economic area eea individuals to other countries including binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses sccs in june 2021 the ec imposed new scc requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on netapp and its contracting parties including requirements related to government access transparency enhanced data subject rights and broader thirdparty assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data transferred from netapp or its partners to countries outside the eea to the extent netapp relies on sccs such engagements will require new contractual arrangements under the updated requirements to avoid limitations on netapp’s ability to process eea data in countries outside of the eea in addition to the eu’s general data privacy regulation other global governments have adopted new privacy and data protection laws in particular the uk’s exit from the eu has resulted in a parallel comprehensive privacy law known as the uk general data protection regulation which is similarly supplemented by other domestic data protection laws such as the uk data protection act 2018 

the rapidly evolving regulatory framework in this area is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers customers privacy advocates and industry groups also may propose new and different 

 

selfregulatory standards or standards of care that may legally or contractually apply to us and these standards may be subject to change these factors create uncertainty and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards or changes to such laws regulations or standards or to their interpretation or enforcement may have on our business or the businesses of our partners vendors and customers in addition changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers 

because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security along with industry standards are uncertain it is possible that relevant laws regulations or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are or are alleged to be inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products any failure or perceived failure by us or our business partners to comply with federal state or international laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security commitments relating to privacy data protection and information security contained in our contracts selfregulatory standards that apply to us or that third parties assert are applicable to us or our policies or notices we post or make available could subject us to claims investigations sanctions enforcement actions and other proceedings disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal liability penalties or injunctions 

additionally as a technology provider our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services particularly to customers in highlyregulated industries we have invested company resources in complying with new laws regulations and other obligations relating to privacy data protection and information security and we may be required to make additional significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall as a result of any inability to comply with such laws and regulations our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur significant costs and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to modify or change our products or our business practices any of which could have an adverse effect on our business our business could be subject to stricter obligations greater fines and private causes of action including class actions under the enactment of new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security including but not limited to the european union general data protection regulation which provides for penalties of up to 20 million euros or four percent of our annual global revenues uk general data protection regulation which provides for penalties up to 15 million pounds or four percent of our annual global revenue the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act and other us statebased regulation 

if our products or services are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our operating results including gross margins and customer relationships may be harmed 

our products and services are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues impacting certain products and in the future we could experience reliability issues with services we provide such quality and reliability issues may be due to for example our own designs or processes the designs or processes of our suppliers andor flaws in thirdparty software used in our products these types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions the use and discharge of hazardous materials and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones many governments including the us the united kingdom and australia have adopted regulations concerning the risk of human trafficking in supply chains which govern how workers are recruited and managed we incur costs to comply with the requirements of such laws further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm 

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons including most recently to russia belarus and portions of ukraine these regulations have caused the company to stop selling or servicing our products temporarily in restricted areas such as russia belarus and portions of ukraine the bis and ofac have also placed restrictions on dealing with certain blocked” entities such as russia’s federal security service fsb including the company’s filing of notifications to the fsb for exporting certain products to russia violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions 

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours in addition while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business third parties have from time to time asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by nonpracticing entities such claims may be made against our products and services our customers’ use of our products and services or a combination of our products and thirdparty products we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to thirdparty intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims even in situations in which the thirdparty’s allegations are meritless then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us 

patent litigation is particularly common in our industry we have been and continue to be in active patent litigations with nonpracticing entities while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace there is no guarantee that in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products affect our ability to supply or service our customers andor require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements 

we expect that companies in the enterprise storage and data management cloud storage and cloud operations markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims and any such infringement claims discussed above could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause suspension of product shipments or product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect 

 

our operating results financial condition and cash flows such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of thirdparty software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue 

in addition many of our products use opensource software such opensource software generally does not provide any warranty or contractual protection and may be susceptible to attack from bad actors further opensource software may contain vulnerabilities which may or may not be known at the time of our inclusion of the software in a product if a vulnerability in such software is successfully exploited we could be subject to damages including remediation costs reputational damage and lost revenues 

our failure to adjust to emerging standards may harm our business 

emerging standards may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

risks related to our securities 

our stock price is subject to volatility 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares however if we fail to meet any investor expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time 

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results 

• seasonality such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 

 

• linearity such as our historical intraquarter customer orders and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total orders and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter and 

• unpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery 

if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

as of april 29 2022 we had 27 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2022 2024 2025 2027 and 2030 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor enter into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results financial condition and cash flows will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase 

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

general risks 

we are unable to predict the extent to which the global covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate such as india including office closures and working remotely for the vast majority of employees all of which could negatively impact our business the magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is uncertain and has limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products and services as well as the timing of future supply of product components the covid19 pandemic and its uneven recovery have adversely affected and we expect may continue to adversely affect our business in a variety of ways including by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services and our ability to build and convert our sales pipeline including delayed and deferred purchases restricting our sales marketing and distribution efforts disrupting our supply chain including delaying delivery and increasing the cost of critical product components and our ability to deliver product to customers and constraining business operations research and development capabilities engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities including in india in addition the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our suppliers customers and partners for an indefinite period of time including as a result of travel restrictions andor business shutdowns and limited access to capital markets all of which have and may continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations including cash flows accordingly we expect the covid19 pandemic to have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations the magnitude and duration of which we are unable to predict additionally concerns over the economic impact of covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which volatility has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and could impact our ability to access capital markets more generally the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations for an extended period of time to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein such as those relating to our products and services financial performance credit rating and debt obligations 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export 

 

of materials could lead to significant business disruptions for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impeding the mobility of our personnel inventories equipment and products and disrupting our business operations furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods droughts hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business as a result of climate change we expect the frequency and impact of such natural disasters or other material disruptions to increase if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires if any significant disaster were to occur there our ability to operate our business and our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions and the outcome of income tax audits changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits 

many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result many of these changes if enacted in whole or in part could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our operating result financial condition and cash flows 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations which in turn would negatively impact our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition beginning in our fiscal 2023 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them pursuant to irc section 174 although congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it will materially increase our effective tax rate changes in us corporate tax law are currently being considered by the us congress and if certain of these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation they could materially impact our operations and financial results 

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the accompanying notes set forth under item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data the following discussion also contains trend information and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in item 1a – risk factors are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference 

executive overview

as our products and solutions portfolios evolve market dynamics change and management continues to assess our largest opportunities we periodically change how we manage our business as of the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2022 our chief operating decision maker codm who is our chief executive officer realigned internal reporting and began using financial information for components of our business organized based on category of productsolution to evaluate performance and allocate resources this resulted in the creation of two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes hybrid cloud and public cloud our codm measures the performance of each segment based on segment revenue and segment gross profit

global business environment 

macroeconomic conditions 

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad could result in adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession in particular in fiscal 2022 we experienced inflationary pressure and constraints in our supply chain 

supply chain constraints particularly in the second half of fiscal 2022 led to higher product component and freight costs which increased our cost of revenues supply chain constraints also delayed our ability to fulfill certain customer orders during the fiscal year given the uncertainties that exist in the broader technology supply chain we are continuing to invest in inventory and certain longerterm commitments to help mitigate the impact of supply shortages 

if these macroeconomic uncertainties or supply chain challenges persist or worsen in fiscal 2023 we may observe reduced customer demand for our offerings increased competition for critical components challenges fulfilling certain customer orders or continued increases in component and freight costs which could impact our operating results including our ability to achieve historical levels of revenue growth 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in many of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate since march 2020 the vast majority of our employees have been working remotely and we have limited business 

 

travel as a result of covid19 we continued to observe certain customers delaying purchases of our products and services while other customers accelerated or placed new orders to address the demands of remote working and digital business 

russia sanctions 

beginning in february 2022 in response to russian military actions in ukraine the us and other countries imposed sanctions on russia and we suspended business operations including sales support on existing contracts and professional services in russia and belarus the impact of these actions was not significant to our fiscal 2022 financial results however their ultimate magnitude and duration remain uncertain and we will continue to closely monitor their potential impacts to our business 

the magnitude and duration of the disruption to our business and impact to our operational and financial performance of the factors above remain uncertain refer to item 1a – risk factors for the significant risks we have identified related to the global business environment 

financial results and key performance metrics overview 

the following table provides an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years in millions except per share amounts and percentages 

 

  

  

• net revenues  our net revenues increased 10 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase in both product revenues and services revenues with the latter primarily driven by an increase in public cloud revenues 

• gross profit margin percentage our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased less than one percentage point in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to a slight increase in gross profit margins on product revenues 

• income from operations as a percentage of net revenues our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased by less than one percentage point in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to a slightly higher gross profit margin percentage and lower sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues partially offset by the gain on sale of certain properties in fiscal 2021 that did not recur in fiscal 2022 

• provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to onetime benefits in fiscal 2022 related to the prepayment of certain intercompany expenses 

• net income and diluted net income per share the increase in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 reflect the factors discussed above higher net income and increased share repurchases in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 favorably impacted diluted net income per share 

• operating cash flows operating cash flows decreased by 8 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily reflecting the timing of accounts receivables billings and collections and employee compensation payments partially offset by higher net income 

• deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased 229 million or 6 as of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the aggregate contract value under software and hardware support contracts primarily reflecting a higher mix of allflash systems which carry a higher support dollar content than our other products

discussion and analysis of results of operations 

net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

  

the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was due to an increase in both product revenues and services revenues with revenues increasing despite the additional week in fiscal 2021 product revenues and services revenues as a percentage of net revenues both remained relatively consistent in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in services revenues which benefited from an additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 while product revenues were relatively flat product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately three percentage points compared to fiscal 2020 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited net revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

sales through our indirect channels represented 77 77 and 79 of net revenues in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues

in order to provide visibility into the value created by our software innovation and rd investment we disclose the software and hardware components of our product revenues software product revenues includes the os software and optional addon software solutions attached to our systems across our entire product set while hardware product revenues include the nonsoftware component of our systems across the entire set because our revenue recognition policy under gaap defines a configured storage system inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality as a single performance obligation the hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered nongaap measures the hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers down to the level of the product hardware and software components this allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which netapp has historically billed customers for such respective components 

total product revenues increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily driven by an increase in sales of allflash array systems and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of storagegrid partially offset by a decrease in sales of netapp hci supply chain challenges related to the covid19 pandemic impeded our ability to fulfill certain customer orders in fiscal 2022 particularly in the fourth quarter 

total product revenues were relatively flat in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 suffering from less favorable macroeconomic conditions through most of fiscal 2021 in part due to the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic but then improving in the last quarter of fiscal 2021 sales of allflash array systems increased in fiscal 2021 though this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our other products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited product revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

revenues from the hardware component of product revenues represented 41 45 and 51 of product revenues in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the software component of product revenues represented 59 55 and 49 of product revenues in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in the software component percentage of product revenues in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 is primarily due to a higher mix of allflash array systems sales which contain a higher proportion of software components than other hybrid cloud products

hybrid cloud 

hybrid cloud services revenues are derived from the sale of 1 support which includes both hardware and software support contracts the latter of which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements bug fixes and patch releases and 2 professional and other services which include customer education and training 

 

support revenues increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 despite an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that contributed approximately 40 million of additional revenues in that period the increase is primarily due to a higher mix of allflash systems which carry a higher support dollar content than our other products in the current year the increase in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was partially due to the additional week in that period both periods benefitted from a higher aggregate contract value of the installed base under support contracts 

professional and other services revenues increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in demand from increased product sales the increase in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the additional week in that period and general increase in customer demand for such services 

public cloud 

public cloud revenues are derived from the sale of public cloud offerings primarily delivered asaservice which include cloud storage and data services and cloud operations services 

public cloud revenues increased in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to growing customer demand for netapps diversified cloud offerings coupled with overall growth in the cloud market and the acquisition of spot inc spot late in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 fiscal 2022 also benefitted from the acquisition of cloudcheckr early in the third quarter of that year

materials costs increased by approximately 156 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 reflecting the increase in product revenues in the current year period the mix of systems sold and higher component and freight costs as a result of covid19 related supply chain challenges excess and obsolete inventory reserves were lower in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

hybrid cloud product gross margins remained relatively flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 despite the increase in component and freight costs which were offset primarily by a higher mix of allflash array systems sales which have higher margins than hybrid systems we anticipate the increase in component and freight costs related to supply chain challenges will continue to impact gross margins into fiscal year 2023 

materials costs increased by approximately 96 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the trend in product mix toward allflash array systems which have higher margins but carry higher materials costs than hybrid systems was the primary driver of these increases excess and obsolete inventory reserves and warranty expenses were lower in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

hybrid cloud product gross margins decreased by two percentage points in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices of most of our products partially offset by a higher mix of allflash array product sales 

unallocated 

unallocated cost of product revenues decreased in fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year of each respective period due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the second half of fiscal 2021

cost of public cloud revenues increased in fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2021 compared to the respective prior years reflecting the ongoing growth in public cloud revenues in each period public cloud gross margins increased by three percentage points in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and twentyfour percentage points in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reflecting efficiencies from scaling our public cloud segment 

unallocated 

unallocated cost of services revenues increased in fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2021 compared to the respective prior years due to our acquisitions of cloudcheckr in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and spot in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which resulted in higher amortization expense from acquired intangible assets

the components of other expense net were as follows 

 

  

nm  not meaningful 

interest income decreased during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 compared to the respective prior years due to both a reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and lower yields earned on the investments 

interest expense remained flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes remained consistent interest expense increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as we issued senior notes in aggregate principal amount of 20 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the impact from the issuance of these senior notes was partially offset by the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance during fiscal 2021 

the differences in other net during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 are partially due to foreign exchange gains and losses yearoveryear in fiscal 2021 other net includes a 6 million gain recognized on our sale of a minority equity interest in a privately held company for proceeds of approximately 8 million this benefit was more than offset by a 14 million loss recognized from the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

 

  

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities 

 

  

as of april 29 2022 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 41 billion reflecting a decrease of 462 million from april 30 2021 during fiscal 2022 we generated 12 billion of cash from operating activities offset by 600 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock 446 million used for the payment of dividends 226 million in purchases of property and equipment and 380 million net of cash acquired used for the acquisition of three privatelyheld companies net working capital was 20 billion as of april 29 2022 a reduction of 557 million when compared to april 30 2021 the reduction in net working capital is partially due to the reclassification of 250 million principal amount of our senior notes from longterm to current liabilities in fiscal 2022 

cash flows from operating activities 

during fiscal 2022 we generated cash from operating activities of 12 billion reflecting net income of 937 million adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 194 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 245 million 

significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2022 included the following 

• accounts receivable increased 313 million primarily reflecting less favorable shipping linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

• deferred revenue and financed unearned services increased by 384 million due to an increase in the aggregate contract value under software and hardware support contracts primarily reflecting a higher mix of allflash systems which carry a higher support dollar content than our other products 

• accounts payable increased by 181 million primarily due to higher inventory purchase levels in fiscal 2022 and the timing of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of each year 

• accrued expenses decreased by 111 million primarily reflecting a reduction of income tax liabilities and a decrease in accruals for incentive compensation and commissions plans 

during fiscal 2021 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion reflecting net income of 730 million adjusted by adding noncash depreciation and amortization expense of 207 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 197 million and subtracting the gain on sale or derecognition of assets of 156 million 

 

significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2021 included the following 

• deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased 193 million primarily due to an increase in deferred software and hardware support contracts associated with a growing installed base as well as growth in public cloud contracts 

• accrued expenses increased 134 million primarily due to higher accruals for incentive compensation plans 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipping linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management vendor payment initiatives tax benefits or charges from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

during fiscal 2022 we generated 45 million primarily from maturities of investments in availableforsale securities net of purchases and paid 226 million for capital expenditures we paid 380 million net of cash acquired for three privatelyheld companies 

during fiscal 2021 we generated 365 million from the sale of properties located in sunnyvale california and 160 million from maturities and sales of investments in availableforsale debt securities net of purchases we paid 350 million net of cash acquired for two privatelyheld companies and 162 million for capital expenditures 

cash flows from financing activities 

during fiscal 2022 cash flows used in financing activities totaled 10 billion and include 600 million for the repurchase of approximately seven million shares of common stock and 446 million for the payment of dividends 

during fiscal 2021 we received 20 billion from the issuance of senior notes which was partially offset by the use of 513 million for the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 420 million for the net repayment of commercial paper notes with original maturities of three months or less 427 million for the payment of dividends and 125 million for the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all for further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements including the impact of the covid19 pandemic see item 1a risk factors 

liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 29 2022 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash we expect to generate from operations and our commercial paper program and related credit facility 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions 

 

  

 

as of april 29 2022 and april 30 2021 23 billion and 25 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 18 billion and 21 billion respectively were available in the us 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases andor business acquisitions service interest and principal payments on our debt fund our stock repurchase program and pay dividends as and if declared in the ordinary course of business we engage in periodic reviews of opportunities to invest in or acquire companies or units in companies to expand our total addressable market leverage technological synergies and establish new streams of revenue particularly in our public cloud segment 

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 29 2022 

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

senior notes 

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 29 2022 in millions 

 

  

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 8 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

commercial paper program and credit facility 

we have a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 10 billion the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or alternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes no commercial paper notes were outstanding as of april 29 2022 

in connection with the program we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders the credit agreement which was amended on january 22 2021 provides for a 10 billion revolving unsecured credit facility with a sublimit of 50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf the credit facility matures on january 22 2026 with an option for us to extend the maturity date for two additional 1year periods subject to certain conditions the proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program as of april 29 2022 we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement  no amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented 

 

capital expenditure requirements 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be between 250 million and 300 million 

dividends and stock repurchase program 

on may 27 2022 we declared a cash dividend of 050 per share of common stock payable on july 27 2022 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 8 2022 

as of april 29 2022 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 151 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program under this program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 29 2022 we repurchased a total of 347 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3995 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 139 billion as of april 29 2022 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 13 billion 

purchase commitments 

in the ordinary course of business we make commitments to thirdparty contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products in addition we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services these offbalance sheet purchase commitments totaled 12 billion at april 29 2022 of which 09 billion is due in fiscal 2023 with the remainder due thereafter 

financing guarantees 

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables we sold 59 million and 102 million of receivables during fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively 

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets as of april 29 2022 and april 30 2021 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements 

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements as of april 29 2022 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 17 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price which may include fixed andor variable amounts among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach 

 

  

 

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories 

 

 goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of one of our reporting units may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we allocated goodwill to our segments and reporting units using a relative fair value approach and as a result we performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying amount therefore there was no impairment of goodwill for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we performed a qualitative test which did not result in any goodwill impairment charges to date the impacts of the covid19 pandemic have not significantly adversely affected the fair value of our reporting units

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes 

 

  

 




 it em 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

interest rate risk 

fixed income investments — as of april 29 2022 we had fixed income debt investments of 22 million and certificates of deposit of 71 million our fixed income debt investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these fixed income debt investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds and us treasury and government debt securities and our certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 29 2022 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of less than 1 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments 

debt — as of april 29 2022 we have outstanding 27 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments 

 

bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 8 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 29 2022 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging 

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of 12 months or less see note 11 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

seasonality

we have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are typically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from customer orders booked in the same quarter customer orders and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if recurring services and cloud revenue continues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues historical seasonal patterns may become less pronounced

backlog

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

competition

we operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware software and related services offerings cloud digital transformation and artificial intelligence initiatives are driving changes in customer and solution requirements

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve our hybrid cloud solutions primarily compete with legacy it and storage vendors some offer a broad spectrum of products solutions and services and others offer a more limited set of storage and datamanagement products solutions or services additionally public cloud providers offer customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire through capital expenditures we both partner with and compete against cloud providers with our public cloud software and services we rarely see legacy vendors competing in the cloud

we face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business including from both branded and genericproduct competitors 

our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and further increase competitive pressures

we consider our software innovation cloud integration and technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers a full range of expertise before during and after their purchases

 item 1a risk factors 

the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

 

risks related to our business and industry

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new software and cloud offerings such as astra by netapp spot by netapp and new hardware and allflash storage products subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products services and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services in addition as new or enhanced products and services are introduced we must avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in the introduction of new products services and solutions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products services and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and governments around the world and the purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth our traditional market the networked storage hardware market experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of cloud environments built on commodity hardware increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments while customers are navigating through their information technology it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and changing how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage we are unable to predict whether the impact of the covid19 pandemic will accelerate the decline of our traditional market and increase demand for our cloud offerings our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in this report our revenue may decline on a yearoveryear basis as it did in fiscal years 2017 and 2020 the future impact of these trends on both short and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could suffer 

 

 

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels with a corresponding variety of sales cycles the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners which now include public cloud providers this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newer public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for application data management for kubernetes some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service provider competitors provide customers storage for their data centers on demand without requiring a capital expenditure which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the increase in the number of employees working remotely has accelerated customer adoption of competitors’ cloud solutions and contributed to increased competition in the market 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish new business models more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash cloud storage and converged infrastructure offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as fullstack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our business operating results including our revenue growth and profitability financial condition and cash flows

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the it market impacted availability of supplies and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs or other barriers to global trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy and higher interest rates could materially adversely impact the demand for our products and our operating results we are also unable to predict whether increased customer spending on our cloud offerings and virtual desktop infrastructure will continue after the covid19 pandemic consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

transition to consumptionbased business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business and as a result may harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased software as a service saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems 

these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumptionbased offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline 

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relative to our consumption model offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure and adverse public health developments in particular the ongoing covid19 pandemic and current trade tensions between the us and china could impact our business and operating results for products we manufacture in mexico tensions between the us and mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers or impact pricing or our business and operating results in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including reductions announced in fiscal years 2019 2020 and 2021 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could disrupt our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs or fail to grant equity competitively we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our sales cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows

  as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we acquired two privately held companies the benefits we have received and expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition such as differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy protection controls make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

initiatives intended to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

we are exposed to credit risks and our investment portfolio may experience fluctuations in market value or returns 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments and the returns thereon may fluctuate substantially a resurgence of covid19 or other circumstances could result in an economic slowdown and possibly cause a global recession an economic slowdown or increased regional or global economic uncertainty may lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions governments and insurers which could result in a material decline in the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns 

risks related to our customers and sales

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets in particular strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloudbased business however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate 

significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies including major cloud providers are also competitors thereby complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results  financial condition and cash flows  

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past and could negatively affect our revenues in the future

a significant portion of our net revenues is generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

we recently reorganized our sales resources which included changes and additions to our sales leadership team to gain operational efficiencies and improve the alignment of our resources with customer and market opportunities we expect to continue developing our sales organization and gotomarket model towards these goals throughout fiscal 2022 the reorganization of our sales resources and ongoing evolution of our gotomarket model could result in short or longterm disruption of our sales cycles may not produce the efficiencies and benefits desired and could harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in may 2018 april 2019 may 2019 may 2020 and august 2020 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges in fiscal 2020 we further reorganized our gotomarket organization to streamline operations and improve alignment with customer and market opportunities in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we realigned resources to optimize our business and fund our biggest opportunities we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including our business unit structure and sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from thirdparty resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our operating results including revenues may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements including with respect to data security could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results  financial condition and cash flows  

if we do not achieve forecasted sales orders in any quarter our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter orders typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of orders consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed

our gross margins may vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product software support hardware support and other services offerings increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product software support hardware support and other services offerings could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience increased losses as potentially more customers are unable to pay all or a portion of their obligations to us particularly in the current environment when access to sources of liquidity may be limited as a result of the global covid19 pandemic beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions

risks related to our products and services

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to manufacture our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

• impacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments including outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

 

• limited number of suppliers for certain components 

 

• no guarantees of supply and limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates 

 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 

• business legal compliance litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship our products in the quantities quality and manner we require and 

 

• disruptions due to floods earthquakes storms and other natural disasters particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources 

such risks have subjected us and could in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed for example the current global shortage of semiconductors could reduce our flexibility to react to product mix changes and unforecasted orders the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business including customer relationships and as a result could harm our operating results financial condition and cash flows

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our business operating results financial condition and cash flows may be harmed

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems within our supply chain or on our enduser customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit and sell products and services that store and transmit personal sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personal information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized use alteration or disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and proceedings and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information or other security breach could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information or our supply chain cybersecurity is compromised and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years with the potential for such acts heightened as a result of the number of employees working remotely due to covid19 security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting it products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems we also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach additionally we use thirdparty service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data such as saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches 

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media and other online communication forums and services any security incident loss of data or other security breach whether actual or perceived or whether impacting us or our thirdparty service providers could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media and other online communication forums and services this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

 

failure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security could cause harm to our reputation result in liability and adversely impact our business

 

our business is subject to increasing regulation by various federal state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security the rapidly evolving regulatory framework in this area is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers customers privacy advocates and industry groups also may propose new and different selfregulatory standards or standards of care that may legally or contractually apply to us and these standards may be subject to change these factors create uncertainty and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards or changes to such laws regulations or standards or to their interpretation or enforcement may have on our business or the businesses of our partners vendors and customers in addition changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers

 

 

because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security along with industry standards are uncertain it is possible that relevant laws regulations or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are or are alleged to be inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products any failure or perceived failure by us or our business partners to comply with federal state or international laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security commitments relating to privacy data protection and information security contained in our contracts selfregulatory standards that apply to us or that third parties assert are applicable to us or our policies or notices we post or make available could subject us to claims investigations sanctions enforcement actions and other proceedings disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal liability penalties or injunctions 

 

additionally as a technology provider our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services particularly to customers in highlyregulated industries we have invested company resources in complying with new laws regulations and other obligations relating to privacy data protection and information security and we may be required to make additional significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall as a result of any inability to comply with such laws and regulations our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur significant costs and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to modify or change our products or our business practices any of which could have an adverse effect on our business our business could be subject to stricter obligations greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security including but not limited to the european union general data protection regulation which provides for penalties of up to 20 million euros or four percent of our annual global revenues the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act

if our products or services are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our operating results including gross margins and customer relationships may be harmed

our products and services are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues impacting certain products and in the future we could experience reliability issues with services we provide such quality and reliability issues may be due to for example our own designs or processes the designs or processes of our suppliers andor flaws in thirdparty software used in our products these types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions the use and discharge of hazardous materials and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones many governments including the us the united kingdom and australia have adopted regulations concerning the risk of human trafficking in supply chains which govern how workers are recruited and managed we incur costs to comply with the requirements of such laws further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons the bis and ofac have also placed restrictions on dealing with certain blocked” entities such as russia’s federal security service fsb including the company’s filing of notifications to the fsb for exporting certain products to russia violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings 

against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions 

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours in addition while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others

we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business third parties have from time to time asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by nonpracticing entities such claims may be made against our products and services our customers’ use of our products and services or a combination of our products and thirdparty products we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to thirdparty intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims even in situations in which the thirdparty’s allegations are meritless then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us 

patent litigation is particularly common in our industry we have been and continue to be in active patent litigations with nonpracticing entities while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace there is no guarantee that in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products affect our ability to supply or service our customers andor require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements  

we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims and any such infringement claims discussed above could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause suspension of product shipments or product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of thirdparty software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source 

software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue 

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

risks related to our securities

our stock price is subject to volatility

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares however if we fail to meet any investor expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 



 



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness

as of april 30 2021 we had 27 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2022 2024 2025 2027 and 2030 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor enter into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results financial condition and cash flows will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely 

impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase 

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

general risks 

we are unable to predict the extent to which the global covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations while we are currently considered an essential business in many of the key regions in which we operate including in the united states us there is no guarantee that we will continue to be classified as such we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate such as india including office closures and working remotely for the vast majority of employees all of which could negatively impact our business the magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is uncertain and has limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products and services the covid19 pandemic and its uneven recovery have adversely affected and we expect may continue to adversely affect our business in a variety of ways including by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services and our ability to build and convert our sales pipeline including delayed and deferred purchases restricting our sales marketing and distribution efforts disrupting our supply chain and our ability to deliver product to customers and constraining business operations research and development capabilities engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities including in india in addition the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our suppliers customers and partners for an indefinite period of time including as a result of travel restrictions andor business shutdowns and limited access to capital markets all of which have and may continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations including cash flows accordingly we expect the covid19 pandemic to have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations the magnitude and duration of which we are unable to predict additionally concerns over the economic impact of covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which volatility has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and could impact our ability to access capital markets more generally the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations for an extended period of time to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein such as those relating to our products and services financial performance credit rating and debt obligations

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impeding the mobility of our personnel inventories equipment and products and disrupting our business operations furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires if any significant disaster were to occur there our ability to operate our business and our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions and the outcome of income tax audits changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results financial condition and cash flows

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or 

international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits 

many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result many of these changes if enacted could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our operating result financial condition and cash flows

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations which in turn would negatively impact our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition evolving or revised tax laws and regulations globally including the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act deferral on tax deductions for certain research and development expenses could change the amount or accounting treatment of the expense we occur in the future president biden has detailed his made in america tax plan which includes proposed increases to tax rates on both domestic and foreign income if these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation they could materially impact our operations and financial results

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected

covid19

the novel coronavirus or covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate since march 2020 the vast majority of our employees have been working remotely and we have suspended business travel

during fiscal 2021 due to macroeconomic uncertainty caused by covid19 we continued to observe certain customers delay purchases of our products and services while other customers accelerated or placed new orders to address the demands of remote working and digital business we also experienced certain logistical challenges in delivering our products and services to customers in 

certain regions and minor supply chain constraints given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain we have begun to invest in inventory and certain longerterm commitments to help mitigate the risk of supply shortages 

 

we believe our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases required debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations

real estate transactions

in april 2021 we announced the sale of our corporate headquarters located in sunnyvale california consisting primarily of land buildings and improvements for cash proceeds of 365 million the assets sold had a net book value totaling 210 million to facilitate an orderly transition to a new location we executed shortterm lease agreements with the buyer to lease back these properties the agreed lease payments were below market rates and as a result we recognized an asset of 7 million for the difference between the fair value of the leases and the agreed lease payments the cash proceeds less direct selling costs plus the fair value of the belowmarket leases resulted in a net gain on the sale of 156 million 

contemporaneous with the sale we executed a lease with a separate landlord for our new corporate headquarters located in san jose california which is comprised of approximately three hundred thousand square feet of office space the lease commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and requires future minimum undiscounted payments of approximately 180 million over the initial 11year lease term it also provides us two successive renewal options each for five years 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the 

transaction price which may include fixed andor variable amounts among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach 

 

 



inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 





goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount therefore found no impairment of goodwill to date the impacts of the covid19 pandemic have not significantly adversely affected the fair value of our reporting unit

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



 

income taxes

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

 



new accounting standards

see note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies for the impact to our financial statements of the adoption of the accounting standard update on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2021

see note 2 – recent accounting standards not yet effective of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial statements

discussion and analysis of results of operations

net revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in hardware and software support revenues which benefited from an additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 while product revenues were relatively flat product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately three percentage points compared to fiscal 2020 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited net revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues product revenues as a percent of net revenues decreased six percentage points in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

sales through our indirect channels represented 77 79 and 76 of net revenues in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues 

 



product revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

product revenues are derived through the sale of our data solutions and consist of sales of configured allflash array and hybrid systems which are bundled hardware and software products as well as addon flash disk andor hybrid storage and related os netapp hci storagegrid  oem products and addon optional software  

total product revenues were relatively flat in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 suffering from less favorable macroeconomic conditions through most of the current year in part due to the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic but then improving in the last quarter of the year sales of allflash array systems increased in the current year though this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our other products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited product revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020

total product revenues declined in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to less favorable macroeconomic conditions lower enterprise it spending throughout fiscal 2020 and gotomarket execution issues experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with some of our largest global customer accounts additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 increasing macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic contributed to demand weakness while associated logistical challenges led to delays in deliveries of products and services to certain customers

as discussed in the overview section beginning in fiscal 2021 we disclose the software and hardware components of our product revenues because our revenue recognition policy under g enerally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap defines a configured storage system inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality as a single performance obligation the hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered nongaap measures the hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers down to the level of the product hardware and software components this allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which netapp has historically billed customers for such respective components we believe that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the company’s software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and rd investment 

r evenues from the hardware component of product revenues totaled 1355 million representing 45 of product revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to 1541 million representing 51 of product revenues in fiscal 2020 compared to 1935 million representing 52 of product revenues in fiscal 2019 the software component of product revenues totaled 1636 million representing 55 of product revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to 1454 million representing 49 of product revenues in fiscal 2020 compared to 1820 million representing 48 of product revenues in fiscal 2019 the increase in the software component percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to a higher mix of allflash array systems revenues which contain a higher proportion of software components than other products 

software support revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

software support revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers

the growth in software support revenues reflects higher public cloud services revenue and the higher aggregate contract value of the installed base under software support contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts 

software support for fiscal 2021 benefitted from the continued growth in allflash array product sales as all  flash systems carry a higher support dollar content than our other products software support revenues were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which contributed approximately 20 million of additional revenues 

hardware support and other services revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

hardware support and other services revenues include hardware support professional services and educational and training services revenues

hardware support contract revenues were 1195 million 1142 million and 1182 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which contributed approximately 20 million of additional revenues and an increase in our installed base the decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in average selling price on contracts executed during the year

professional services and educational and training services revenues were 277 million 241 million and 263 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

revenues by geographic area

nm  not meaningful

interest income decreased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to both a reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and lower yields earned on the investments interest income decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a reduction in the size of our investment portfolio as a result of our sale of approximately 10 billion of availableforsale debt securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and net maturities over the remainder of the year 

interest expense increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as we issued senior notes in aggregate principal amount of 20 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the impact from the issuance of these senior notes was partially offset by the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance during fiscal 2021 interest expense remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as we repaid our maturing senior notes but increased our average outstanding commercial paper balance

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities

 



 

as of april 30 2021 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 46 billion reflecting an increase of 17 billion from april 24 2020 the increase was primarily due to 20 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes 13 billion of cash provided by operating activities and 365 million proceeds from the sale of properties in sunnyvale california partially offset by 513 million used for the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 420 million used for the net repayment of commercial paper notes with original maturities of three months or less 350 million used for the acquisitions of two privatelyheld companies 427 million used for the payment of dividends 162 million in purchases of property and equipment and 125 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock working capital increased by 19 billion to 25 billion as of april 30 2021 compared to april 24 2020 primarily due to the increases in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments discussed above

cash flows from operating activities

during fiscal 2021 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion reflecting net income of 730 million adjusted by adding noncash depreciation and amortization expense of 207 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 197 million and subtracting the gain on sale or derecognition of assets of 156 million

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all for further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements including the impact of the covid19 pandemic see item 1a risk factors 

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 30 2021 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash we expect to generate from operations and our commercial paper program and related credit facility

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 25 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 21 billion and 04 billion respectively were available in the us the tax cuts and jobs act tcja enacted into law in december 2017 imposed a onetime transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes as a part of the recognition of the impacts of the tcja we reviewed our projected global cash requirements and determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings were no longer indefinitely reinvested 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases andor business acquisitions  service interest and principal payments on our debt  fund our stock repurchase program and pay dividends as and if declared  

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 30 2021

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

we have a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 10 billion the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or alternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes no commercial paper notes were outstanding as of april 30 2021 

in connection with the program we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders the credit agreement which was amended on january 22 2021 provides for a 10 billion revolving unsecured credit facility with a sublimit of 50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf the credit facility matures on january 22 2026 with an option for us to extend the maturity date for two additional 1year periods subject to certain conditions the proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program as of april 30 2021 we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement  no amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented 

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to be between 225 million and 250 million

dividends and stock repurchase program 

on may 28 2021 we declared a cash dividend of 050 per share of common stock payable on july 28 2021 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 9 2021

as of april 30 2021 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 136 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program and on may 28 2021 authorized the repurchase of an additional 500 million of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 30 2021 we repurchased a total of 340 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3902 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 133 billion as of april 30 2021 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 03 billion 

purchase commitments

in the ordinary course of business we make commitments to thirdparty contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products in addition we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services these offbalance sheet purchase commitments totaled 800 million at april 30 2021 of which 584 million is due in fiscal 2022 with the remainder due thereafter

financing guarantees

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables we sold 102 million and 59 million of receivables during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets as of april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements 

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements as of april 30 2021 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

interest rate risk 

fixed income investments  — as of april 30 2021 we had fixed income debt investments of 67 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 30 2021 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of less than 1 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 30 2021 we have outstanding 27 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 9 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 30 2021 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than 12 months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

seasonality

we have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are typically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 847 million 827 million and 783 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyper converged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products solutions and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products solutions or services

technology trends – for example the emergence of hosted or cloud storage saas hyperconverged infrastructure and flash storage – are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements 

we compete against dell technologiesemc corporation hewlett packard enterprise company hitachi vantara and international business machines corporation as well as pure storage nutanix and other smaller players customer storage needs may also be addressed by cloud service providers cloud service providers provide customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire through capital expenditures while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our customers recognize the value in our cloud and data fabric strategies our strategy includes integrating and building relationships with leading cloud providers 

our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

we consider innovation cloud integration and our technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase 

proprietary rights

netapp generally relies on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment well over a thousand us patents hundreds of pending us patent applications and many corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries our primary trademarks are netapp and the netapp design logo which are registered trademarks in the us and in many other countries in addition we have trademarks and trademark registrations in the us and other countries covering our various product or service names

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers distributors customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the cdp which is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to customers and institutional investors we promote alternative transportation programs through education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time however it is often difficult to anticipate future regulations pertaining to environmental matters and to estimate their impacts on our operations based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not currently subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that could be material to our operations nor are we aware of any such measures that will impact us in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct periodic reviews and are subject to thirdparty audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

employees 

as of april 24 2020 we had approximately 10800 employees worldwide none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

we are unable to predict the extent to which the global covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations financial condition results of operations or cash flows

the novel coronavirus or covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations while we are currently considered an essential business in many of the key regions in which we operate including in the united states us there is no guarantee that we will continue to be classified as such we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate including office closures and working remotely for the vast majority of employees all of which could negatively impact our business the magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is uncertain and has limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products and services the covid19 pandemic has and we expect it to continue to adversely affect our business in a variety of ways including by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services and our ability to build and convert our sales pipeline including delayed and deferred purchases restricting our sales marketing and distribution efforts disrupting our supply chain and our ability to deliver product to customers and constraining business operations research and development capabilities engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities in addition the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our suppliers customers and partners for an indefinite period of time including as a result of travel restrictions andor business shutdowns and limited access to capital markets all of which have and may continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations including cash flows accordingly we expect the covid19 pandemic to have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations the magnitude and duration of which we are unable to predict additionally concerns over the economic impact of covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which volatility has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and could impact our ability to access capital markets more generally the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations for an extended period of time to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein such as those relating to our products and services financial performance credit rating and debt obligations

our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth our traditional market the networked storage hardware market experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of cloud environments built on commodity hardware increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments while customers are navigating through their information technology it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage we are unable to predict whether the impact of the covid19 pandemic will accelerate the decline of our traditional market and increase demand for our cloud offerings our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in this report our revenue may decline on a yearoveryear basis as it did in fiscal years 2016 2017 and 2020 the future impact of these trends on both short and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

new or additional product introductions including new hardware and software offerings such as netapp hci cloud volumes ontap and new all flash storage products subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products services and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services in addition as new or enhanced products and services are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in the introduction of new products services and solutions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels with a corresponding variety of sales cycles and we recently reorganized our sales resources to improve the alignment of those resources with customer and market opportunities the reorganization of our sales resources could result in short or longterm disruption of our sales cycles and harm our operating results the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners which now include hyperscalers this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newer public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage for their data centers on demand without requiring a capital expenditure which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the increase in the number of employees working remotely could accelerate customer adoption of cloud solutions and contribute to increased competition in the market 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish new business models more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash cloud storage and converged infrastructure offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as fullstack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain for example in april 2017 hp enterprise completed their acquisition of nimble storage in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability 

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain for example we are unable to predict the economic impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on us or our employees suppliers customers and partners and consequently we withdrew our guidance for the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2020 and have limited our fiscal 2021 guidance to cover only the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we are also unable to predict whether increased customer spending on our cloud offerings and virtual desktop infrastructure will continue during and after the covid19 pandemic consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

transition to consumptionbased business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased software as a service saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumptionbased offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements including for the software license components of enterprise software license agreements for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relative to our consumption model offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 



 



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed 

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets in particular strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloudbased business however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors thereby complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past and could negatively affect our revenues in the future

a significant portion of our net revenues is generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

our gross margins may vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services offerings increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services offerings could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

• impacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments including outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

 

• limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates 

 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 

• business legal compliance litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship our products in the quantities quality and manner we require and 

 

• disruptions due to floods earthquakes storms and other natural disasters particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources 

such risks have subjected us and could in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure and adverse public health developments in particular the ongoing covid19 pandemic current trade tensions between the us and china including newly imposed tariffs in 2019 and the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union effective on january 31 2020 could impact our business and operating results for products we manufacture in mexico tensions between the us and mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers or impact pricing or our business and operating results in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits 

many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result many of these changes if enacted could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition the us tax law changes enacted through the tax cuts and jobs act effective in december 2017 are subject to further interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organizations such as the treasury department andor internal revenue service changes to interpretations of the law could change the amount or accounting treatment of the expense we have recorded in relation to the transition tax we have elected to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years as result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media  and other online communication forums and services  this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business 

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our enduser customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit personal sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personal information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized use alteration or disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and proceedings and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information or other security breach could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years with the potential for such acts heightened as a result of the number of employees working remotely due to covid19 security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting it products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems we also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach additionally we use thirdparty service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data such as saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs social media and other online communication forums and services any security incident loss of data or other security breach whether actual or perceived or whether impacting us or our thirdparty service providers could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

failure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security could cause harm to our reputation result in liability and adversely impact our business

 

our business is subject to increasing regulation by various federal state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security the rapidly evolving regulatory framework in this area is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers privacy advocates and industry groups also may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us and these standards may be subject to change these factors create uncertainty and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards or changes to such laws regulations or standards or to their interpretation or enforcement may have on our business or the businesses of our partners vendors and customers in addition changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners vendors and customers

 

because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security along with industry standards are uncertain it is possible that relevant laws regulations or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are or are alleged to be inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products any failure or perceived failure by us or our business partners to comply with federal state or international laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security commitments relating to privacy data protection and information security contained in our contracts selfregulatory standards that apply to us or that third parties assert are applicable to us or our policies or notices we post or make available could subject us to claims investigations sanctions enforcement actions and other proceedings disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal liability penalties or injunctions 

 

additionally as a technology provider our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services particularly to customers in highlyregulated industries we have invested company resources in complying with new laws regulations and other obligations relating to privacy data protection and information security and we may be required to make additional significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall as a result of any inability or inability to comply with such laws and regulations our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur significant costs and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to modify or change our products or our business practices any of which could have an adverse effect on our business our business could be subject to stricter obligations greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security including but not limited to the european union general data protection regulation which became effective on may 25 2018 and which provides for penalties of up to 20 million euros or four percent of our annual global revenues and the california consumer privacy act which became effective on january 1 2020

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in may 2018 april 2019 and may 2019 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 we moved to a business unit structure to enable us to develop the organization and systems to successfully execute a multiproduct business in fiscal 2020 we further reorganized our gotomarket organization to streamline operations and improve alignment with customer and market opportunities we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including our business unit structure and sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from thirdparty resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities 

if our products or services are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed

our products and services are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues impacting certain products and in the future we could experience reliability issues with services we provide such quality and reliability issues may be due to for example our own designs or processes the designs or processes of our suppliers andor flaws in thirdparty software used in our products these types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including reductions announced in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our sales cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results 

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2018 we acquired two privately held companies the benefits we have received and expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements including with respect to data security could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

initiatives intended to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

as of april 24 2020 we had 12 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2021 2022 and 2024 and we had an aggregate of 523 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with maturities primarily less than three months we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor enter into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase significant volatility in capital markets caused by the covid19 pandemic has recently heightened these risks

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to credit risks and our investment portfolio may experience fluctuations in market value or returns 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments and the returns thereon may fluctuate substantially further the impact of the covid19 pandemic could exacerbate an economic slowdown and possibly cause a global recession an economic slowdown or increased regional or global economic uncertainty may lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions governments and insurers which could result in a material decline in the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns 

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours in addition while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others

we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business third parties have from time to time asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by nonpracticing entities such claims may be made against our products and services our customers’ use of our products and services or a combination of our products and thirdparty products we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to thirdparty intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims even in situations in which the thirdparty’s allegations are meritless then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us 

patent litigation is particularly common in our industry we have been and continue to be in active patent litigations with nonpracticing entities while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace there is no guarantee that in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products affect our ability to supply or service our customers andor require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements  

we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims and any such infringement claims discussed above could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of thirdparty software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience increased losses as potentially more customers are unable to pay all or a portion of their obligations to us particularly in the current environment when access to sources of liquidity is limited as a result of the global covid19 pandemic beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing 

companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impeding the mobility of our personnel inventories equipment and products and disrupting our business operations furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires if any significant disaster were to occur there our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions the use and discharge of hazardous materials and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones many governments including the us the united kingdom and australia have adopted regulations concerning the risk of human trafficking in supply chains which govern how workers are recruited and managed we incur costs to comply with the requirements of such laws further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our stock price is subject to volatility

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares for example during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we announced the suspension of our stock repurchases to strengthen our liquidity position given the uncertainty surrounding the overall impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic however if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price

covid19

the novel coronavirus or covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees our customers and the communities in which we operate since march 2020 the vast majority of our employees have been working remotely and we have suspended business travel

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to increased macroeconomic uncertainty caused by covid19 we observed certain customers delay purchases of our products and services while other customers accelerated or placed new orders to address the 

demands of remote working and digital business though on a net basis the impact to product revenues was unfavorable we also experienced certain logistical challenges in delivering our products and services to customers in certain regions and minor supply chain constraints 

 

we believe our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends required debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in march 2020 we suspended our stock repurchase program

 

the magnitude and duration of the disruption to our business and impact to our operational and financial performance caused by covid19 pandemic is uncertain refer to item 1a – risk factors for the significant risks we have identified as a result of the covid19 pandemic

adoption of lease accounting standard

in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we adopted the new accounting standard leases asc 842 using the modified retrospective approach electing the optional transition method of not adjusting our comparative period financial statements adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of approximately 149 million of operating lease rightofuse assets net of deferred rent and restructuring liabilities and 158 million of lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning of fiscal 2020 see note 10 – leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

senior notes maturity

on september 27 2019 we made an aggregate cash payment of 400 million to extinguish our 200 senior notes at maturity this repayment was funded through the sale of shortterm commercial paper notes issued under our existing program and cash on hand

real estate transaction

in september 2017 we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings located in sunnyvale california through two separate and independent closings the first of which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the remaining properties consisting of land were classified as assets held for sale and included as other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of april 26 2019 on august 29 2019 the second closing occurred and we consummated the sale of the land with a net book value of 53 million and received cash proceeds of 96 million resulting in a gain net of direct selling costs of 38 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price which may include fixed andor variable amounts among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach

  



inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 





goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount therefore found no impairment of goodwill to date the impacts of the covid19 pandemic have not significantly adversely affected the fair value of our reporting unit

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

 



new accounting standards

see note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies for the impact to our financial statements of the adoption of the accounting standard leases asc 842 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020

see note 2 – recent accounting standards not yet effective of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial statements

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 132 compared to an effective tax rate of 78 for fiscal 2019 and an effective tax rate of 903 for fiscal 2018 our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings primarily income from our european operations being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was higher than the prior year primarily due to the shift in jurisdictional mix of income resulting in a lower foreign rate differential a higher global minimum tax on intangible income gmt provision and reduced benefit attributable to stockbased compensation

key components of the effective tax rate of 132 in fiscal 2020 included a benefit of 61 million or 64 percentage points related to the lapse of statutes of limitations an expense of 32 million or 34 percentage points for gmt a benefit of 40 million or 42 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 a benefit of 16 million or 17 percentage points from the generation of federal research credits an expense of 15 million or 16 percentage points related to transition tax adjustments and a benefit of 4 million or 04 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation

as a result of the us federal corporate income tax rate change effective as of january 1 2018 we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future periods during fiscal 2018 we recorded 108 million of tax expense related to all tax rate changes upon finalization of our provisional estimates during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded tax expense of 6 million related to deferred tax assets for equitybased compensation awards to our executives

the tcja imposed a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets and 8 on the remaining earnings in fiscal 2018 we recorded a 732 million discrete tax expense for the estimated us federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of 5 million to our provisional estimate

under the tcja the gmt provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations under us gaap companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either i account for gmt as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules or ii account for gmt in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes we have elected to recognize the gmt as a period cost and thus recorded 32 million and 22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively

during fiscal 2020 we generated 14 billion from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases and paid 124 million for capital expenditures additionally we received 96 million for the sale of land in sunnyvale california and paid 73 million to acquire two privatelyheld companies

during fiscal 2019 we generated 876 million from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases and paid 173 million for capital expenditures

cash flows from financing activities 

during fiscal 2020 we used 14 billion for the purchase of 25 million shares of our common stock 439 million for the payment of dividends 400 million for the repayment of our senior notes due september 2019 partially offset by 273 million in proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes net and 102 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee common stock award plans

during fiscal 2019 we used 21 billion for the repurchase of 29 million shares of our common stock 403 million for the payment of dividends and 136 million for the repayment of commercial paper notes net partially offset by 121 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase plans

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all for further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements including the impact of the covid19 pandemic see item 1a risk factors 

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 24 2020 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash we expect to generate from operations and our commercial paper program and related credit facility

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 25 billion and 37 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 04 billion and 02 billion respectively were available in the us the tcja imposed a onetime transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes as a part of the recognition of the impacts of the tcja we have reviewed our projected global cash requirements and have determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs service interest and principal payments on our debt fund our stock repurchase program and pay dividends as and if declared and invest in critical and complimentary technologies through asset purchases and or business acquisitions including our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire spot inc a provider of compute management and cost optimization services on the public clouds for more information see note 19 – subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 24 2020

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance 

and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec  we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

senior notes

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 24 2020 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 9 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

commercial paper program and credit facility

we have a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 10 billion the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or alternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes as of april 24 2020 we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of 523 million a weightedaverage interest rate of 201 and maturities primarily less than three months 

in connection with the program we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on december 10 2021 the credit agreement provides a 10 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a backup for the program proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the program the credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional oneyear periods both subject to certain conditions as of april 24 2020 we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement no amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be between 175 million and 225 million

dividends and stock repurchase program

on may 26 2020 we declared a cash dividend of 048 per share of common stock payable on july 29 2020 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 10 2020

as of april 24 2020 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 136 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program under this program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 24 2020 we repurchased a total of 338 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3886 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 131 billion as of april 24 2020 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 05 billion

d uring the first quarter of fiscal 2021  we announced the suspension of our stock repurchases to strengthen our liquidity position given the uncertainty surrounding the overall impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements 

contractual obligations

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 24 2020 in millions

 



 

 











some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

financing guarantees

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize product revenues for these arrangements net of any payment discounts from financing transactions upon product acceptance we sold 59 million and 87 million of receivables during fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the enduser customer if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as updated to reflect the adoption of asc 606 in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights we defer revenue associated with these advance payments until the related refund rights expire and we perform the services as of april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated 

liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements 

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements as of april 24 2020 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

offbalance sheet arrangements

our offbalance sheet arrangements with suppliers are discussed in the contractual obligations section above additionally we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the thirdparties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

interest rate risk

fixed income investments  — as of april 24 2020 we had fixed income debt investments of 224 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 24 2020 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 2 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 24 2020 we have outstanding 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 9 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

commercial paper program and credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 10 billion commercial paper program and our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under these arrangements accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense fluctuates with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating when we borrow any amounts under these arrangements as of april 24 2020 we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of 523 million weightedaverage interest rates of 201 and maturities primarily less than three months as of april 24 2020 there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility see note 9 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than 12 months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

sales principal markets and distribution channels

we market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world to increase visibility of netapp as the data authority in the hybrid cloud we continue to make investments in our multiyear branding and awareness campaigns

our diversified customer base spans industry segments and vertical markets such as energy financial services government high technology internet life sciences healthcare services manufacturing media entertainment animation video postproduction and telecommunications netapp focuses primarily on the cloud data services private cloud and storage markets we design our products to meet the needs of our broad customer base – from large enterprises to midsize customers

netapp uses a multichannel distribution strategy we sell our products solutions and services to enduser business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners we work with a wide range of partners for our customers including technology partners valueadded resellers system integrators oems service providers and distributors during fiscal 2019 sales through our indirect channels represented 76 of our net revenues our global partner ecosystem is critical to netapp’s growth and success we are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers

as of april 26 2019 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5000 managers  sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 43 countries sales to customers arrow electronics inc and tech data corporation which are distributors accounted for 24 and 20 of our net revenues respectively in fiscal 2019 information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 16 – segment geographic and significant customer information of the notes to consolidated financial statements

seasonality

we have historically experienced a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are typically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

b acklog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

manufacturing and supply chain

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee fremont california san jose california san antonio texas guadalajara mexico schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

we are certified to the international organization for standardization iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification standards we are also a partner of the us customs and border protection’s cbp customs trade partnership against terrorism ctpat program

research and development

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 827 million 783 million and 779 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyper converged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products solutions and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products solutions or services

technology trends – for example the emergence of hosted or cloud storage saas hyperconverged infrastructure and flash storage – are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage as an operating expense which competes with more traditional storage offerings that customers acquire through capital expenditures while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our customers recognize the value in our cloud and data fabric strategy our strategy includes integrating and building relationships with these new classes of providers and to date we have established relationships with more than 300 cloud service providers and hyperscaler providers including aws google ibm softlayer and microsoft azure

we compete against dell technologiesemc corporation hewlett packard enterprise company hitachi vantara and international business machines corporation as well as pure storage nutanix and other smaller players our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

we consider innovation cloud integration and our technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase

proprietary rights

netapp generally relies on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business 

is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark cop yright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment well over a thousand us patents hundreds of pending us patent applications and many corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries our primary trademarks are netapp and the netapp design logo which are registered trademarks in the us and in many other countries in addition we have numerous trademarks and trademark registrations in the us and other countries covering our various pr oduct names 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the cdp which is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to customers and institutional investors we promote alternative transportation programs through education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time however it is often difficult to anticipate future regulations pertaining to environmental matters and to estimate their impacts on our operations based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not currently subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that could be material to our operations nor are we aware of any such measures that will impact us in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct periodic reviews and are subject to thirdparty audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

employees

as of april 26 2019 we had approximately 10500 employees worldwide none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth our traditional market the networked storage hardware market experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of cloud environments built on commodity hardware increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments while customers are navigating through their information technology it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in the report our revenue may decline on a yearoveryear basis as it did in fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 the future impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new hardware and software offerings such as netapp hci cloud volumes ontap and new all flash storage products subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products services and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services in addition as new or enhanced products and services are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in the introduction of new products services and solutions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

transition to consumptionbased business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased software as a service saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumptionbased offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could 

have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline 

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements including for the software license components of enterprise software license agreements for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relative to our consumption model offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels with a corresponding variety of sales cycles and we recently reorganized our sales resources to improve the alignment of those resources with customer and market opportunities the reorganization of our sales resources could result in short or longterm disruption of our sales cycles and harm our operating results the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners which now include hyperscalers this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newer public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage for their data centers on demand without requiring a capital expenditure which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish new business models more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash converged infrastructure and cloud storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as fullstack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain for example in october 2016 dell inc and emc corp consummated their agreement to merge also in april 2017 hp enterprise completed their acquisition of nimble storage in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 



 



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets in particular strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloudbased business however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors thereby complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past and could negatively affect our revenues in the future

a significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted

our gross margins vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services offerings increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services offerings could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed 

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

• limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates 

 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 



 



such risks have subjected us and could in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in particular the current trade tensions between the us and china including newly imposed tariffs and the united kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the european union which is now scheduled to be effective on october 31 2019 could impact our business and operating results for products we manufacture in mexico tensions between the us and mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers or impact pricing or our business and operating results in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to 

piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our b usiness operating results and financial condition 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits 

many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result many of these changes if enacted could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition the us tax law changes enacted through the tax cuts and jobs act effective in december 2017 are subject to further interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organizations such as the treasury department andor internal revenue service changes to interpretations of the law could change the amount or accounting treatment of the expense we have recorded in relation to the transition tax we have elected to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years as result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and i nternet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attribut ed to us 

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our enduser customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit personal sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personal information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting it products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security incident whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results our business could be subject to stricter obligations greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of new data privacy laws including but not limited to the european union general data protection regulation enacted on may 25 2018 and the california consumer privacy act to be enacted on january 1 2020

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies 

including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible o r coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in march 2016 november 2016 may 2018 and april 2019 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 we created the storage systems and software cloud data services and cloud infrastructure business units to enable us to develop the organization and systems to successfully execute a multiproduct business we also reorganized our sales resources to better align with customer and market opportunities we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including our new business unit structure and sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from thirdparty resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities

if our products are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed

our hardware and software products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues such quality issues may be due to for example our own designs or processes the designs or processes of our suppliers andor flaws in thirdparty software used in our products quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products we have also increased the cadence of our product release cycle which could impact product and service quality quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products which could lead to a perception of a quality issue customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including an 11 reduction announced in march 2016 a 6 reduction announced in november 2016 and more minor reductions announced in fiscal 2019 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our sales cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results 

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in may 2019 fiscal 2020 we acquired a privately held company in fiscal 2018 we acquired two privately held companies and in fiscal 2016 we acquired solidfire inc the benefits we have received and expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products and in our fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements including with respect to data security could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

initiatives intended to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness

as of april 26 2019 we had 16 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2019 2021 2022 and 2024 and we had an aggregate of 249 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 27 to 38 days we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor enter into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if 

prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase 

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to credit risks and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially therefore although we have not recently realized any significant losses on our investments future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to 

develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversel y affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any suc h litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of som e foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our product s or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours in addition while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property the re is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advan tages 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business third parties have from time to time asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by nonpracticing entities such claims may be made against our products and services our customers’ use of our products and services or a combination of our products and thirdparty products we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to thirdparty intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims even in situations in which the thirdparty’s allegations are meritless then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us 

patent litigation is particularly common in our industry we have been and continue to be in active patent litigations with nonpracticing entities while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace there is no guarantee that in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products affect our ability to supply or service our customers andor require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements  

we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims and any such infringement claims discussed above could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of thirdparty software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters includ ing fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct busi ness if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our abi lity to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires  if any significant disaster were to occur there  our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired 

our stock price is subject to volatility

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price

as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 we adopted the new accounting standard revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the full retrospective method of adoption  accordingly our prior years consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented herein have been restated to conform to the new rules as illustrated in note 7 – revenue of the notes to consolidated financial statements the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior years however application of the new rules to our elas resulted in over 100 million of product revenues for such arrangements in fiscal 2019 that are incremental to the amounts we would have recognized under the old standard under asc 606 we recognize the software license fee component of our elas upfront whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ela 

rest ructuring event s 

 

during fiscal 2019 we announced two separate restructuring and reduction in workforce plans designed to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities in connection with these plans we reduced our worldwide headcount by less than 3 and incurred aggregate charges of approximately 35 million consisting primarily of employee severance costs  

joint venture

 

during fiscal 2019 we formed a joint venture with lenovo beijing information technology ltd “lenovo” in china and in february 2019 contributed assets to the newly formed entity lenovo netapp technology limited “lntl” which began operations the same month in exchange for a noncontrolling 49 equity interest the assets we contributed had an aggregate book value of 7 million while the fair value of our equity interest in lntl was determined to be 80 million resulting in a gain of 73 million lntl will be integral to our sales channels strategy in china acting as a distributor of our offerings to customers headquartered there and involved in certain oem sales to lenovo it will also endeavor to localize our products and services and to develop new joint offerings for the china market by leveraging netapp and lenovo technologies  

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price which may include fixed andor variable amounts among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach

 





inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 



goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount therefore found no impairment of goodwill

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and 

purchased intangible assets 

 



product warranties

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 





income taxes

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 78 compared to an effective tax rate of 903 for fiscal 2018 and an effective tax rate of 225 for fiscal 2017 our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings primarily income from our european operations being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was substantially lower than for the prior year primarily due to the fiscal 2018 impacts of us tax reform and the effects of the resolution of certain income tax examinations during fiscal 2019

key components of the effective tax rate of 78 in fiscal 2019 included a benefit of 84 million or 66 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 a benefit of 48 million or 38 percentage points related to the effects on the resolution of certain income tax examinations a benefit of 19 million or 15 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation and a benefit of 17 million or 13 percentage points from the generation of federal research credits 

key components of the effective tax rate of 903 in fiscal 2018 included a onetime transition tax charge on accumulated foreign earnings of approximately 732 million or 610 percentage points a charge of 108 million or 90 percentage points related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate changes offset by a benefit of 108 million or 90 percentage 

points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than our blended us federal statutory rate of 3 05   and a tax benefit of 23 million or 19 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation 

key components of the effective tax rate of 225 in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 100 million or 161 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 and a tax charge of 16 million or 26 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we recognized a discrete benefit of 48 million arising from the effective settlement of an internal revenue service audit for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal 2001 in that we have carryforward attributes from these years that could be subject to adjustment in the tax years of utilization

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted into law the tcja made significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the imposition of a onetime transition tax on deferred foreign earnings and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings asc 740 income taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the tcja enactment date 

as a result of the us federal corporate income tax rate change effective as of january 1 2018 we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future periods during fiscal 2018 we recorded 108 million of tax expense related to all tax rate changes upon finalization of our provisional estimates during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded tax expense of 6 million related to deferred tax assets for equitybased compensation awards to our executives

the tcja imposed a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets and 8 on the remaining earnings in fiscal 2018 we recorded a 732 million discrete tax expense for the estimated us federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we finalized our computation of the transition tax and recorded a reduction of 5 million to our provisional estimate

as of april 26 2019 we have completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the tcja however we will continue to assess the impact of further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements and recognize any adjustments in the period in which they are determined

under the tcja the global minimum tax on intangible income gmt provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations under us gaap companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either i account for gmt as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules or ii account for gmt in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes we have elected to recognize the gmt as a period cost and thus recorded 22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2019

in october 2016 the fasb issued an asu which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intraentity asset transfers other than inventory as a result tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction is recognized when the transfer occurs even though the pretax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation

during fiscal 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stockbased compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements and recorded a charge of 18 million following the postadoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stockbased compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense 

we are currently undergoing various income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing calculations are key issues under these audits and are often subject to dispute and appeals

in september 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 by our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for such withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal in december 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling in favor of netapp the danish tax examination agency appealed this decision at the danish high court dhc in march 2012 in february 2016 the dhc requested a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union cjeu parties were heard before the court in october 2017 in march 2018 the advocate general issued an opinion which was largely in favor of netapp the cjeu was not bound by the opinion of the advocate general and issued its preliminary ruling in february 2019 the cjeu ruling did not preclude the danish tax authorities from imposing withholding tax on distributions based on the benefits of certain european union directives the preliminary ruling will be reviewed and may be subjected to additional briefing by the dhc once complete the dhc will then issue its final decision while the timing and outcome of a final decision on this matter is uncertain we believe it is more likely than not that our distributions were not subject to withholding tax and we intend to vigorously defend any withholding tax claims by the danish tax authorities

 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions we engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude certain statutes of limitations will lapse or both as a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time 

 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements

 



 

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities

 



 

as of april 26 2019 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 39 billion reflecting a decrease of 15 billion from april 27 2018 the decrease was primarily due to 21 billion paid for the repurchase of our common stock 403 million used for the payment of dividends 173 million in purchases of property and equipment and 136 million used for the net repayment of commercial paper notes partially offset by 13 billion of cash provided by operating activities working capital decreased by 17 billion to 17 billion as of april 26 2019 primarily due to the decreases in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments discussed above and the reclassification of 400 million principal amount of our senior notes to current liabilities 

cash conversion cycle

days may not add due to rounding

 









cash flows from operating activities 

during fiscal 2019 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion reflecting net income of 12 billion adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 197 million stockbased compensation of 158 million and a gain on derecognition of assets of 73 million

cash flows from investing activities

during fiscal 2019 we generated 876 million from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases and paid 173 million for capital expenditures

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all

liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 26 2019 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash we expect to generate from operations and our commercial paper program and related credit facility

as of april 26 2019 and april 27 2018 37 billion and 45 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 02 billion and 09 billion respectively were available in the us the tcja imposes a onetime transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes as a part of the recognition of the impacts of the tcja we have reviewed our projected global cash requirements and have determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies service interest and principal payments on our debt fund our stock repurchase program and pay dividends as and if declared

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 26 2019

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 26 2019 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

commercial paper program and credit facility

we have a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 10 billion the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount 

from par or al ternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes as of april 26 2019  we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of  249 million a weightedaverage interest rate of 2 73  and maturities ranging from 27 days to 38 days 

in connection with the program we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on december 10 2021 the credit agreement provides a 10 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a backup for the program proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the program the credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional oneyear periods both subject to certain conditions as of april 26 2019 we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement no amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between 150 million and 200 million

dividends and stock repurchase program

on may 22 2019 we declared a cash dividend of 048 per share of common stock payable on july 24 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 5 2019

as of april 26 2019 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 136 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program under this program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 26 2019 we repurchased a total of 313 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3746 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 117 billion as of april 26 2019 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 19 billion

the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 26 2019 in millions

 



 

 











some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

financing guarantees

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize product revenues for these arrangements net of any payment discounts from financing transactions upon product acceptance we sold 87 million and 67 million of receivables during fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the enduser customer if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as updated to reflect the adoption of asc 606 in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights we defer revenue associated with these advance payments until the related refund rights expire and we perform the services as of april 26 2019 and april 27 2018 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements as of april 26 2019  we have not b een required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearne d services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

indemnification agreements

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the thirdparties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

interest rate risk

fixed income investments  — as of april 26 2019 we had fixed income debt investments of 17 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 26 2019 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 40 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 26 2019 we have outstanding 16 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 26 2019 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

as of april 27 2018 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5100 managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 47 countries sales to customers arrow electronics inc and tech data corporation which are distributors each accounted for 17 of our net revenues in fiscal 2018 information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 16 – segment geographic and significant customer information of the notes to consolidated financial statements

seasonality

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

manufacturing and supply chain

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee san jose california san antonio texas guadalajara mexico schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

we are certified to the international organization for standardization iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification standards

research and development

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 783 million 779 million and 861 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyper converged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services

technology trends – for example the emergence of hosted or cloud storage saas and flash storage – are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems capital expenditures for the customers’ data centers which competes with more traditional storage offerings while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our customers recognize the value in our cloud and data fabric strategy our strategy includes integrating and building relationships with these new classes of providers and to date we have established relationships with more than 300 cloud service providers and hyperscaler providers including aws google ibm softlayer and microsoft azure

we compete against dell technologiesemc corporation hewlett packard enterprise company hitachi vantara and international business machines corporation as well as pure storage nutanix and other smaller players our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

we consider innovation cloud integration and our technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase

proprietary rights

netapp generally relies on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment well over a thousand us patents hundreds of pending us patent applications and many 

corresponding patents and patent applications in other countries our primary trademarks are netapp and the netapp design logo which are registered trademarks in the us and in many other countries in addition we have numerous trademarks and trademark registrations in the us and other countries covering our various product names 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the cdp which is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors we promote alternative transportation programs through education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that could be material to our operations in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct periodic reviews and are subject to thirdparty audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

employees

as of april 27 2018 we had approximately 10300 employees worldwide none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

our business may be harmed by trends in the networked storage hardware market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth the networked storage hardware market experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of cloud environments built on commodity hardware increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments while customers are navigating through their it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in the report our revenue may decline as it did in fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 on a yearover year basis the future impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and related services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new hardware and software offerings such as netapp hci cloud volumes ontap and new all flash storage products subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in new product and solutions introductions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

our new consumption based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased software as a service saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumption based offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could 

reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute o ur consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline 

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we could experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relative to our consumption model offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels with a corresponding variety of sales cycles and we recently reorganized our sales resources to improve the alignment of those resources with customer and market opportunities the reorganization of our sales resources could result in short or longterm disruption of our sales cycles and harm our operating results the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners which now include hyperscalers this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically require a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage for their data centers on demand without requiring a capital expenditure which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash converged infrastructure and cloud storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain for example in october 2016 dell inc and emc corp consummated their agreement to merge also in april 2017 hp enterprise completed their acquisition of nimble storage in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability

continuing global economic uncertainty political conditions and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our gross margins vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mix of product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices changes in product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenue mix or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses is fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets in particular strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloudbased business however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors thereby complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurri ng purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected us in the past and in the future could  negatively affect our revenues 

a significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

• limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers that are higher than market rates 

 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 



 



such risks have in the past and could again in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations is located and a significant portion of our revenues is derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural 

disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in particular the current trade tensions with c hina could impact our business and operating results in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products in cluding antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our in tellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits 

many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result many of these changes if enacted could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition the recent us tax law changes enacted through the tax cuts and jobs act are subject to further interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organizations such as the treasury department andor irs changes to interpretations of the law could change the provisional tax expense or accounting treatment of the 732 million expense we have recorded in relation to the transition tax we have elected to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years as result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in may 2015 march 2016 and november 2016 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 we created the storage systems a nd software cloud data services and cloud infrastructure business units to enable us to develop the organization and systems to successfully execute a multiproduct business we also reorganized our sales resources to improve the alignment of those resou rces with customer and market opportunities we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including our new business unit structure and sales account coverage c ould adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings a ssociated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of dis continued products charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities 

if our products are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed

our hardware and software products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues such quality issues may be due to for example our own designs or processes the designs or processes of our suppliers andor flaws in third party software used in our products quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products we have also increased the cadence of our product release cycle which could impact product and service quality quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products which could lead to a perception of a quality issue customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our end user customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit personal sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personal information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or other security breach could result 

in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues 

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting information technology products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security incident whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results in addition a security incident or loss of personal information could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues our business could be subject to stricter obligations and greater fines under the enactment of new data privacy laws including the european union general data protection regulation enacted on may 25 2018

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including an 11 reduction announced in march 2016 and a 6 reduction announced in november 2016 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of these initiatives

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and busin ess processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulato ry regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could h ave an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results and financial conditi on 

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in fiscal 2018 we acquired two privately held companies and in fiscal 2016 we acquired solidfire inc the benefits we have received and expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown in october 2013 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products and in our fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements including with respect to data security could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to credit risks and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially therefore although we have not recently realized any significant losses on our investments future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness

as of april 27 2018 we had 16 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2019 2021 2022 and 2024 and we had an aggregate of 385 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 19 to 32 days we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor entering into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to 

service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors result i n higher interest upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase 

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours in addition while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business third parties have from time to time asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by nonpracticing entities such claims may be made against our products and services our customers’ use of our products and services or a combination of our products and thirdparty products we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to thirdparty intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims even in situations in which the third party’s allegations are meritless then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us 

patent litigation is particularly common in our industry we have been and continue to be in active patent litigations with nonpracticing entities while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace there is no guarantee that in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products affect our ability to supply or service our customer andor require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements  

we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims and any such infringement claims discussed above could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of third party software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publiclydisclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to 

conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economi c activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affe cted in addition our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired 

our stock price is subject to volatility

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price

  on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax reform reconciliation act originally referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted into law this tax reform legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others our net income in fiscal 2018 includes a onetime tax reformrelated provisional charge of 858 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition reserves and allowances

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software maintenance services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software maintenance services we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue

 





inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 



goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair 

values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount therefore found no impairment of goodwill

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets

 



product warranties

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary

the following are the key estimates and assu mptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties 

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

discussion and analysis of results of operations

overview  — net revenues for fiscal 2018 were 5911 million an increase of 392 million or 7 compared to fiscal 2017 reflecting higher product revenues partially offset by slightly lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues net revenues for fiscal 2017 were 5519 million a decrease of 27 million relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues partially offset by higher product revenues and software maintenance revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased one percentage point compared to fiscal 2017 reflecting higher margins on product revenues and slightly higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2018 increased three and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average selling prices asps and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2017 was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting lower margins on product revenues mostly offset by higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 totaled 2792 million or 47 of net revenues representing a decrease of one and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year coupled with relatively consistent average headcount in both fiscal years sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 totaled 2683 million or 49 of net revenues representing a decrease of 5 percentage points compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a lower average headcount as a result of our restructuring plans as well as other cost reduction initiatives partially offset by additional operating expenses related to our acquisition of solidfire inc solidfire

net revenues in million s except percentages 

 



 

the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 455 million in product revenues partially offset by a decrease of 56 million in hardware maintenance and other services revenues while software maintenance revenues were relatively flat product revenues as a percent of net revenues increased four percentage points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues

 



product revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

product revenues are derived through the sale of our strategic and mature solutions and consist of sales of configured systems which are bundled hardware and software products as well as addon flash disk andor hybrid storage and related os original equipment manufacturer oem products and addon hardware and software

total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled 2449 million in fiscal 2018 reflecting a 24 increase from 1971 million in fiscal 2017 this increase was primarily due to a 4 increase in unit volume of clustered ontap systems and an increase in asp driven by sales of our allflash fas products total product revenue from mature solutions totaled 1012 million in fiscal 2018 reflecting a 2 decrease from 1035 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to a 73 decrease in unit volume of 7mode systems and a 13 decrease in oem revenues partially offset by a 13 increase in addon hardware storage and related os revenues these fluctuations reflect our planned transition of our product offerings and the adoption by our customers of our newer allflash and hybridcloud compatible products

total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled 1971 million in fiscal 2017 reflecting a 17 increase from 1682 million in fiscal 2016 this increase was primarily due to a 15 increase in unit volume of clustered ontap systems partially offset by a decrease in asp reflecting higher discounting and promotional programs total product revenue from mature solutions totaled 1035 million in fiscal 2017 reflecting a 21 decrease from 1304 million in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 57 decrease in unit volume of 7mode systems as well as a decrease in asp in addition addon hardware storage and related os revenues decreased 11 while oem revenues increased 4

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profits pricing changes discounting practices product competition foreign currency unit volumes customer mix natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues cost of revenues andor gross profits disk drive and flash storage materials are a significant component of our storage systems while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues

software maintenance revenues in millions except percentages  

 



 

software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers

the fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts software maintenance revenues in fiscal 2016 were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of that year

materials costs increased 107 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 reflecting a 14 increase in materials costs related to strategic products primarily due to higher unit volume of clustered ontap systems 

an increase in asp for strategic systems resulted in higher margins for strategic products in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year margins in fiscal 2018 also benefitted from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations margins for mature products were relatively consistent in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year

materials costs increased 143 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting a 32 increase in materials costs related to strategic products primarily due to higher unit volume of clustered ontap systems

a decrease in asp for strategic systems combined with the increase in unit materials costs resulted in lower gross margins for strategic products in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year average unit materials costs for mature products were relatively flat compared to the prior year which when combined with a decrease in asp resulted in lower gross margins for mature products

cost of product revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were also favorably impacted by an 18 million decrease in warranty expense reflecting our product quality and cost reduction efforts and a decrease of 31 million in the amortization of intangibles due to the impact of certain acquired developed technologies being fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2016 partially offset by amortization related to the solidfire acquisition

provision for income taxes in millions except percentages

 



 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 935 compared to an effective tax rate of 235 for fiscal 2017 and an effective tax rate of 336 for fiscal 2016 our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings primarily income from our european operations which are headquartered in the netherlands being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was substantially higher compared to the prior years primarily due to the provisional effects of the tcja enacted on december 22 2017 

key components of the effective tax rate of 935 in fiscal 2018 included a onetime transition tax charge on accumulated foreign earnings of approximately 732 million or 628 percentage points a charge of 126 million or 108 percentage points related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate changes offset by a benefit of 108 million or 93 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than our blended us federal statutory rate of 305 and a tax benefit of 23 million or 20 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation 

key components of the effective tax rate of 235 in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 100 million or 150 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 and a tax charge of 16 million or 24 percentage points attributable to stockbased compensation 

key components of the effective tax rate of 336 in fiscal 2016 included a benefit of 81 million or 235 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 a charge of 64 million or 186 percentage points related to the integration of solidfire intellectual property into our tax structure a tax charge of 20 million or 58 percentage points in connection with the settlement of income tax audits and a benefit of 14 million or 41 percentage points related to research and development credits

on december 22 2017 the tcja was enacted into law the tcja made significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate the imposition of a onetime transition tax on deferred foreign earnings and a shift to a modified territorial tax regime given the timing and pace of regulatory guidance the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which allows for the recording of provisional amounts related to us tax reform and subsequent related adjustments during a measurement period

 

as of april 27 2018 we have not fully completed the accounting for the tax impacts of the tcja and in connection with sab 118 have recorded provisional tax charges based on reasonable estimates for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new corporate rate and for the transition tax on our total post1986 foreign earnings and profits ep the tcja also includes provisions for a global minimum tax on intangible lowtaxed income gmt of foreign subsidiaries a base erosion antiabuse tax on certain intercompany payments and beneficial tax treatment for foreign derived intangible income these provisions will be effective for us beginning in our fiscal 2019 we will continue to refine provisional balances and make adjustments during the measurement period based on the issuance of further regulatory guidance changes in interpretations and the collection and analysis of additional information these adjustments could be material to our financial statements the provisional amounts recorded during the current year are explained below

 

the tjca decreased the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 for fiscal 2018 this decrease results in a blended statutory tax rate of 305 as a result of the tax rate change we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in future periods we recorded a 126 million tax expense for fiscal 2018 related to all tax rate changes the final remeasurement impact could vary from the provisional amount if actual future activities impacting deferred tax balances differ from our estimates 

 

the tcja imposes a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign ep not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 on earnings to the extent of foreign cash and other liquid assets and 8 on the remaining earnings for fiscal 2018 we recorded 732 million of tax expense for the estimated us federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax our estimates may change with further guidance from us federal and state tax authorities or other regulatory bodies and additional analyses that we expect to complete during the measurement period with respect to various components of the computations we intend to make the election to pay the onetime transition tax over a period of eight years

under the tcja the gmt provision taxes foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations under us gaap companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either i account for gmt as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rule s the period cost method or ii account for gmt in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes the deferred method because of the complexity of the new tax rules we are continuing to evaluate this provision and the application of asc 740 and have not yet made an accounting policy election 

during fiscal 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stockbased compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements and recorded a charge of 18 million following the postadoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stockbased compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense 

we are currently undergoing various income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing calculations are key issues under these audits and are often subject to dispute and appeals

in october 2015 the internal revenue service irs completed the examination of our fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax returns and made certain agreedto transfer pricing adjustments during fiscal 2016 we recorded charges totaling 23 million attributable to the audit settlements and the related remeasurement of uncertain tax positions for tax years subject to future audits the irs commenced the examination of our federal tax returns for our fiscal years 2012 and 2013 in august 2016 in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal 2001 in that we have carryforward attributes from these years that could be subject to adjustment in the tax years of utilization

in september 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 by our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for such withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect in december 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling in favor of netapp the danish tax examination agency appealed this decision at the danish high court dhc in march 2012 in february 2016 the dhc requested a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union cjeu parties were heard before the court in october 2017 during march 2018 the advocate general issued an opinion which was largely in favor of netapp however the cjeu is not bound by the opinion of the advocate general it is expected that the preliminary ruling will be issued during our fiscal year 2019 once a ruling has been issued by the cjeu it will be reviewed and may be subjected to additional briefing by the dhc once complete the dhc will then issue its final decision we expect this decision to be complete sometime during our fiscal year 2019 or 2020

 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions we engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude certain statutes of limitations will lapse or both as a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time 

 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements

 



 

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities

 



 

as of april 27  2018  our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled  54 billion reflecting an in crease of  05 billion from april 28  2017  the in crease was primarily due to 15 billion of cash provided by operating activities  795 million of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 210 million in proceeds from the sale of properties partially offset by 750 million paid to redeem our senior notes due in december 2017 794 million in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock   214 million in cash used for the payment of dividends 145 million in purchases of property of equipment and 115 million used for the net repayment of commercial paper notes working capital increased by  1 2 billion to  32 bill ion as of april 27  2018 primarily due to an increase in cas h and cash equivalents  as discussed above  and the fiscal 2018 redemption of our senior notes due december 2017 using net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt

during fiscal 2018 we used 750 million to redeem our senior notes due in december 2017 115 million for the repayment of our commercial paper notes net of issuances 794 million for the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock 214 million for the payment of dividends and generated 795 million in cash from the issuance of longterm debt

during fiscal 2017 we used 850 million to repay our shortterm loan related to the solidfire acquisition 705 million for the repurchase of 22 million shares of our common stock 208 million for the payment of dividends and generated 499 million in cash from issuances of commercial paper notes net of repayments

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 27 2018 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash we expect to generate from operations and our commercial paper program and related credit facility

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 27 2018 and april 28 2017 45 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 09 billion and 04 billion respectively were available in the us the tcja imposes a onetime transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 which resulted in 732 million of tax expense in fiscal 2018 and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes as a part of the provisional estimates recorded during the year we considered the impacts of the tcja in relation to our projected global cash requirements and have determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested for further information see note 14 – income taxes

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs and invest in critical or complementary technologies service interest and principal payments on our debt fund our stock repurchase program and pay dividends as and if declared

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment gra de securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april   27  2018  

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

senior notes

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 27 2018 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

commercial paper program and credit facility

we have a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on july 17 2017 we amended the program to increase the maximum amounts available that may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed to an aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding of 10 billion as compared to 600 million prior to the amendment the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or alternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes as of april 27 2018 we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of 385 million a weightedaverage interest rate of 229 and maturities ranging from 19 days to 32 days 

in connection with the program we have a new senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on december 10 2021 and we terminated our existing credit agreement that had been scheduled to expire on december 21 2017 the new credit agreement which as amended on july 17 2017 provides a 10 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a backup for the program proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the program the credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional oneyear periods both subject to certain conditions as of april 27 2018 we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement no amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be between 175 million and 225 million

dividends and stock repurchase program 

on may 23 2018 we declared a cash dividend of 040 per share of common stock payable on july 25 2018 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 6 2018

as of april 27 2018 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 136 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program including a 40 billion increase approved by our board of directors in april 2018 under this program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 27 2018 we repurchased a total of 284 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3385 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 96 billion 

the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements

contractual obligations

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 27 2018 in millions

 



 

 











some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

financing guarantees

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize product revenues for these arrangements net of any payment discounts from financing transactions upon product acceptance we sold 67 million and 183 million of receivables during fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the enduser customer if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we defer revenues subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance and recognize revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights as of april 27 2018 and april 28 2017 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements as of april 27 2018 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

indemnification agreements

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the thirdparties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

interest rate risk

fixed income investments  — as of april 27 2018 we had fixed income debt investments of 27 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 27 2018 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 57 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 27 2018 we have outstanding 16 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments 

fluctuates when interest rates change see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 10 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 27 2018 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities currently sales transactions and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are not hedged and therefore are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

seasonality

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

backlog

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee san jose california guadalajara mexico san antonio texas schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

we are certified to the international organization for standardization iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification standards

research and development

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 779 million 861 million and 920 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

 

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services

technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems capital expenditures for the customers’ data centers which competes with more traditional storage offerings while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our customers recognize the value in our cloud and data fabric strategy our strategy includes integrating and building relationships with these new classes of providers and to date we have established relationships with more than 300 cloud service providers and hyperscaler providers including aws google ibm softlayer and microsoft azure

we compete against hpe dell technologies hds and ibm as well as pure storage and other smaller players our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

we consider innovation and our technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase

 

proprietary rights

netapp generally relies on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment over 2100 patents issued by and have over 640 patent applications pending with the us patent and trademark office as well as a corresponding number of international patents and patent applications while the durations of our patents vary we believe that the durations of our patents are adequate relative to the expected lives of our products

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

 

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the carbon disclosure project cdp the cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors we promote alternative transportation programs through education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that could be material to our operations in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct an annual review and thirdparty verified audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

employees

as of april 28 2017 we had approximately 10100 employees worldwide none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors and other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

our business may be harmed by trends in the networked storage hardware market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth the networked storage hardware market experienced a decline in each of the last two calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increasing adoption of cloud environment built on commodity hardware increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments while customers are navigating through their it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud it as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in the report our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline as it did in fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 on a yearover year basis the future impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and related services due to the complexity of storage software subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for new products as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new software and flash product offerings such as ontap cloud all flash fas altavault and solidfire subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products and solutions or the products being replaced and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in new product and solutions introductions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

our new consumption based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability

we offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloudbased saas and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumption based offerings additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise hardware and software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues 

and profitabil ity at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers our revenues and profitability could decline 

as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we could experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our hardware arrangements and software licenses that are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery relat ive to our consumption model offering arrangements that are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the arrangement we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers with a corresponding variety of sales cycles in addition the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel partners to promote our products could harm our operating results as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically require a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers provide customers storage as an operating expense rather than as a capital expenditure for the customers’ data centers which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash converged infrastructure and cloud storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain for example in october 2016 dell inc and emc corp consummated their agreement to merge also in april 2017 hp enterprise completed their acquisition of nimble storage in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability

the continuing global economic uncertainty and political and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future which could cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our gross margins vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mix of product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased component costs increased pricing and discounting pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices changes in product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenue mix or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses is fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected us in the past and in the future could negatively affect our revenues

a significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and 

marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ab ility of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products o r stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

• limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

• the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers that are higher than market rates 

 

• limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

• labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

• geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 



 



such risks have in the past and could again in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations is located and a significant portion of our revenues is derived outside of the us in addition most of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development sales and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements tariffs local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

and cash flows we utilize forward and option contrac ts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis our hedging strategies may not be succe ssful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our operating resul ts in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings which could have a material impact on our financial results 

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in march 2014 may 2015 march 2016 and november 2016 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges we may in the future undertake initiatives that may include restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities

if our products are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed 

our hardware and software products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products which could lead to a perception of a quality issue customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our end user customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or other security breach could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities

highprofile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting information technology products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems

many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative p ublicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security breach whether a ctual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results in particular our saas business could be subject to stricter obligations and greater fines u nder the impending enactment of the new european data protection regulation on may 25 2018 

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including an 11 reduction announced in march 2016 and a 6 reduction announced in november 2016 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

a repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund us operations strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability

as of april 28 2017 45 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries under current law repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is lower than projected and is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases dividends acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreignheld cash and incur a significant tax charge in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of these initiatives

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence 

become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and finan cial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in february 2016 we acquired solidfire inc and in fiscal 2015 we acquired the steelstore product line renamed altavault from riverbed technology inc the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown in october 2013 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products and in our fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to credit risks and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially therefore although we have not recently realized any significant losses on our investments future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness

as of april 28 2017 we had an aggregate of 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2017 2021 and 2022 and we had an aggregate of 500 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with maturities ranging from seven to 38 days we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities andor entering into new financing arrangements we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s rating services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest upon any potential future financing then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase

in addition all our debt and credit facility arrangemen ts subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreo ver compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our 

existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or techn ologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a f ailure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despit e our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other int ellectual property rights of ours 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters is located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported operating results

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements the increased use of fair value measures changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our operating results

our stock price is subject to volatility

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt changes in our credit ratings our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price

financial results and key performance metrics overview 

the following table provides an overview of some of our key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years in millions except per share amounts percentages and cash conversion cycle

 



 



 















stock repurchase program and dividend activity

during fiscal 2017 we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3272 per share for an aggregate of 705 million we also declared cash dividends of an aggregate of 076 per share in fiscal 2017 for which we paid an aggregate of 208 million

commercial paper program 

in december 2016 we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding at any time not to exceed 600 million as of april 28 2017 we had 500 million of principal amount in commercial paper notes outstanding

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition reserves and allowances

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software maintenance services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software maintenance services we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue 

 



inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 



goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying amount of each reporting unit and therefore found no impairment of goodwill

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets

 



product warranties

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary

the following are the key estimates and ass umptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties 

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

discussion and analysis of results of operations

overview  — net revenues for fiscal 2017 were 5519 million a decrease of 27 million relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues partially offset by higher product revenues and software maintenance revenues net revenues for fiscal 2016 were 5546 million a decrease of 577 million or 9 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting lower product revenues partially offset by higher software and hardware maintenance and other services revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2017 was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting lower margins on product revenues mostly offset by higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2017 decreased 15 percentage points compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher discounting and product promotions which resulted in the decline in asps as well as higher overall average unit materials costs gross profit margins increased on hardware maintenance and other services due the achievement of a lower cost structure resulting from our recent cost reduction initiatives gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2 percentage points during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting lower margins on product revenues due to primarily to higher discounting and product promotions which resulted in the decline in asps that outpaced the decline in unit materials costs

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 totaled 2683 million a decrease of 5 percentage points as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a lower average headcount as a result of our restructuring plans as well as other cost reduction initiatives partially offset by additional operating expenses related to our acquisition of solidfire inc solidfire sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 totaled 2960 million an increase of 3 percentage points as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a lower revenue denominator partially offset by the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives

net revenues in millions except percentages 

 



 

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of 63 million in hardware maintenance and other services revenues partially offset by an increase of 20 million in product revenues and an increase of 16 million in software maintenance revenues product revenues as a percent of net revenues increased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a decrease of 669 million in product revenues partially offset by a 92 million increase in total software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues product revenues as a percent of net revenues decreased 6 percentage points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues

 



product revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

product revenues are derived through the sale of our strategic and mature solutions and consist of sales of configured systems which are bundled hardware and software products as well as addon flash disk andor hybrid storage and related os original equipment manufacturer oem products and addon hardware and software

product revenues from strategic solutions represented 66 of product revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to 56 in fiscal 2016 product revenues from mature solutions represented 34 of product revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to 44 in fiscal 2016

total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled 1971 million in fiscal 2017 reflecting a 17 increase from 1682 million in fiscal 2016 this increase was primarily due to a 15 increase in unit volume of clustered ontap systems partially offset by a decrease in asp reflecting higher discounting and promotional programs total product revenue from mature solutions totaled 1035 million in fiscal 2017 reflecting a 21 decrease from 1304 million in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 57 decrease in unit volume of 7mode systems as well as a decrease in asp in addition addon hardware storage and related os revenues decreased 11 while oem revenues increased 4 these fluctuations reflect our planned transition of our product offerings and the adoption by our customers of our newer allflash and hybridcloud compatible products

total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled 1682 million in fiscal 2016 reflecting a 20 increase from 1402 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to an 86 increase in unit volume of clustered ontap systems partially offset by a decrease in asp reflecting higher discounting and less favorable product mix total product revenue from mature solutions totaled 1304 million in fiscal 2016 reflecting a 42 decrease from 2253 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 63 decrease in unit volume of 7mode systems as well as a decrease in asp in addition addon hardware storage and related os revenues decreased 19 and oem revenues decreased 38 these fluctuations reflect the movement of customer demand from our older products to our newer products

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profits pricing changes discounting practices product competition foreign currency unit volumes customer mix natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues cost of revenues andor gross profits disk drive and flash storage materials are a significant component of our storage systems while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues

software maintenance revenues in millions except percentages 

 



 

software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers

the fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts our software maintenance revenues were favorably impacted by a change in our pricing strategy effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 such that we now charge for software maintenance services on the storage capacity sold in our configured systems and addon storage products software maintenance revenues in fiscal 2016 were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of that year

hardware maintenance and other services revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance professional services and educational and training services revenues

hardware maintenance contract revenues were 1265 million 1316 million and 1253 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively reflecting a decrease of 4 during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and an increase of 5 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 the decrease in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in asp on hardware maintenance contracts during the year the increase in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the installed base and aggregate contract values under hardware maintenance contracts due largely to higher levels of shorter term contract renewals from our existing contract base hardware maintenance revenues in fiscal 2016 were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of that year

professional services and educational and training services revenues were 283 million 295 million and 317 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

materials costs increased 143 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 reflecting a 32 increase in materials costs related to strategic products primarily due to higher unit volume for configured clustered ontap systems particularly for allflash fas products this was partially offset by a 16 decrease in materials costs for mature products reflecting lower volume in 7mode systems average unit materials costs for clustered ontap systems increased primarily due to changes in product and configuration mix including a higher percentage of systems sold with solid state flash drives in fiscal 2017

a decrease in asp for strategic systems combined with the increase in unit materials costs resulted in lower standard margins for mature products in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year average unit materials costs for 7mode systems were relatively flat compared to the prior year which when combined with a decrease in asp resulted in lower standard margins for mature products

materials costs decreased 85 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting a 47 increase in materials costs related to strategic products primarily due to higher unit volume for configured clustered ontap systems partially offset by a 35 decrease in materials costs for mature products primarily due to lower unit volume in 7mode systems average unit materials costs for clustered ontap systems decreased primarily due to changes in mix while average unit materials costs for 7mode systems were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2015

lower asps in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 for both strategic and mature products only partially offset by lower unit materials costs for strategic products resulted in lower standard margins for both product groups

cost of product revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were also favorably impacted by an 18 million decrease of warranty expense reflecting our product quality and cost reduction efforts and a decrease of 31 million in the amortization of intangibles due to the impact of certain acquired developed technologies being fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2016 partially offset by amortization related to the solidfire acquisition

provision for income taxes in millions except percentages

 



 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 235 compared to an effective tax rate of 336 for fiscal 2016 and an effective tax rate of 215 for fiscal 2015 our effective tax rates reflect the impact of a significant amount of our earnings primarily income from our european operations which are headquartered in the netherlands being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate the effective tax rates for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 were favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits our 

effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of dif ferences in the respective periods’ income before taxes as well as the impacts of discrete events discussed below 

the effective tax rate of 235 in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 100 million or 150 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of 8 million or 12 percentage points related to research and development credits a tax charge of 16 million or 24 percentage points attributable to nondeductible stockbased compensation and a benefit of 4 million or 06 percentage points related to the domestic production activities deduction

the effective tax rate of 215 in fiscal 2015 included a benefit of 141 million or 198 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of 14 million or 19 percentage points related to current and prior year research and development credits a benefit of 5 million or 07 percentage points related to the domestic production activities deduction and charges of 46 million or 65 percentage points in connection with income tax audits

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies stockbased compensation income tax accounting and presentation within the financial statements during fiscal 2017 we recorded a discrete charge of 18 million following the postadoption rules which require that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stockbased compensation be recognized as a component of income tax expense 

in june 2015 the internal revenue service irs signed a closing agreement on our fiscal 2008 to 2010 transfer pricing arrangements and in october 2015 completed the examination of our fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax returns during fiscal 2016 we recorded discrete charges totaling 23 million attributable to the audit settlements and related remeasurement of uncertain tax positions for tax years subject to future audits

in july 2014 the irs completed the examination of our fiscal 2005 to 2007 income tax returns upon approval by the joint committee of taxation during fiscal 2015 we recorded a tax charge of 47 million attributable to the audit settlement and related remeasurements of uncertain tax positions for tax years subject to future audits 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing calculations are key issues under audits in various jurisdictions and are often subject to dispute and appeals our open years in us federal jurisdictions are fiscal 2012 and later years in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal 2001 in that we have tax attribute carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustments in the tax years of utilization

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect on december 19 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax the danish tax examination agency appealed to the danish high court in march 2012 in february 2016 the danish high court referred the case to the european court of justice

 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions we engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude certain statutes of limitations will lapse or both based on current information we do not expect significant changes to our existing unrecognized tax benefits as of april 28 2017 

 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements

 



 

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities 

 



 

as of april 28 2017 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 49 billion reflecting a minimal decrease of 382 million from april 29 2016 the decrease was primarily due to 850 million used to repay our shortterm loan 705 million in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock and 208 million in cash used for the payment of dividends partially offset by 986 million of cash provided by operating activities and 499 million net from the issuance of commercial paper notes working capital decreased by 07 billion to 21 billion as of april 28 2017 primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents the issuance of commercial paper notes and the reclassification of 750 million of the principal balance of our senior notes to current partially offset by the repayment of our shortterm loan

cash conversion cycle

the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter of each of the past three fiscal years



 

days may not add due to rounding

 









cash flows from operating activities

during fiscal 2017 we generated cash from operating activities of 986 million reflecting net income of 509 million adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 226 million stockbased compensation of 195 million and a deferred income tax provision of 90 million

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2017 included the following

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2016 included the following 





we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management vendor payment initiatives tax benefits or charges from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments

cash flows from investing activities

during fiscal 2017 we used 43 million for the purchase of investments net of maturities and sales and paid 175 million for capital expenditures

during fiscal 2016 we generated 982 million from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases expended 842 million of cash on the solidfire acquisition net of cash acquired paid 160 million for capital expenditures and received 102 million of proceeds from the sale of properties

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 28 2017 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash we expect to generate from operations

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 28 2017 and april 29 2016   45 billion and 4 8 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while  04 billion and 0 5 billion respectively were available in the u s most of the amounts held outside the us can be repatriated to the us but under current law would be subject to us federal state income and foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings to fund cash requirements in the us  we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state tax credit carryforwards however our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs an d invest in critical or complementary technologies service interest and principal payments on our debt and pay dividends as and if declared  

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 28 2017

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

senior notes

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 28 2017 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

commercial paper program and credit facility

in december 2016 we entered into a commercial paper program the program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 600 million the maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or alternatively may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance the proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes as of april 28 2017 we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of 500 million a weightedaverage interest rate of 126 and maturities ranging from 7 days to 38 days 

in connection with the program we entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on december 10 2021 and we terminated our existing credit agreement that had been scheduled to expire on december 21 2017 the new credit agreement provides a 600 million revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a backup for the program proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the program the credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional oneyear periods both subject to certain conditions as of april 28 2017 no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility and we were in compliance with all associated covenants

capital expenditure requirements 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be between 175 million and 225 million

dividends and stock repurchase program

on may 24 2017 we declared a cash dividend of 020 per share of common stock payable on july 26 2017 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 7 2017

as of april 28 2017 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 96 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program under this program we can purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 28 2017 we repurchased a total of 269 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3284 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 88 billion as of april 28 2017 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 08 billion with no termination date which we plan to complete by may 2018

the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements

contractual obligations

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 28 2017 in millions

 



 

 













some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected i n the table

in fiscal 2016 we entered into a s aleleaseback arrangement of certain of our land and buildings under which we leased back certain of our properties rent free over lease terms ending at various dates ranging from march 31 2017 to december 31 2017 unless terminated early by us due to the existence of a prohibited form of continuing involvement these properties did not qualify for saleleaseback accounting and as a result they have been accounted for as financing transactions under lease accounting standards under the financin g method until such time as the related leases are terminated the assets will remain on our balance sheets and proceeds received by us from these transactions are reported as financing obligations during the third quarter of fiscal 2017  we terminated one of the leases ending our continuing involvement with the related properties as a result we recorded a noncash sale of properties having a net book value of 9 million the extinguishment of 19 million of associated financing obligations and a gain of 10 million as of april 28 2017 the balance of the remaining financing obligations which relate to properties whose leases we expect to terminate in december 2017 was 130 million at the end of the leaseback period or when our continuing involvement under the leaseback agreement ends this transaction will be reported as a noncash sale and extinguishment of financing obligations and the difference between the then net book value of the properties and the unamortized balance of the financing obligations will be recognized as a gain these financing obligations are reflected as noncash obligations in the preceding commitments table

financial guarantee instruments

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 28 2017 our financial guarantees of 7 million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets consisted primarily of standby letters of credit and surety bonds

financing guarantees

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize product revenues for these arrangements net of any payment discounts from financing transactions upon product acceptance we sold 183 million and 243 million of receivables during fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the enduser customer if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we defer revenues subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance and recognize revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights as of april 28 2017 and april 29 2016 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements as of april 28 2017 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

indemnificatio n agreements 

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the thirdparties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

interest rate risk

fixed income investments  — as of april 28 2017 we had fixed income debt investments of 26 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 28 2017 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 39 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 28 2017 we have outstanding 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 600 million fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 28 2017 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

overview

netapp ®  inc netapp we or us provides software systems and services to manage and store customer data we enable enterprises service providers governmental organizations and partners to envision deploy and evolve their it environments customers benefit from our collaboration with other technology leaders to create the specific solutions they need we were incorporated in 1992 and created the world’s first networked storage appliance today we offer a portfolio of products and services that satisfy a broad range of customer workloads across different data types and deployment models

customer needs

customers continue to seek it solutions that help to improve efficiency lower risk and position them to respond quickly to growth opportunities in an increasingly mobile social and digitally connected world they also need access to realtime insights and have the ability to personalize the experiences they deliver to their own customers netapp provides guidance and innovation to help its customers achieve the right balance of flexibility cost and data control 

chief information officers are embarking on it transformations to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers cloud computing has emerged as a way to more effectively meet rapidly changing business needs customers want to seamlessly integrate public cloud resources as an extension of their internal it environment an approach known as hybrid cloud one of the biggest challenges to this vision is data management while other parts of the it infrastructure are largely interchangeable and carry no history once data is created it needs to be protected and managed for its lifetime as data grows data and application mobility consume more time and bandwidth the net result is that data management netapps core competency has become essential to realizing the promise of the hybrid cloud 

data management on the hybrid cloud today is essentially a series of isolated siloes it organizations need to harmonize the management of data across all cloud providers as well as on premises this is what we call the data fabric our data fabric strategy defines the netapp technology architecture for hybrid cloud today we offer solutions that help customers seamlessly manage their data across their diverse it resources spanning flash disk and cloud customers have the flexibility to choose the right set of resources to meet the needs of their applications and the freedom to change them whenever they want customers are entirely in control of their data regardless of the cloud that it sits on and regardless of the landscape in which it is deployed

at the same time that customers are navigating through their it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evaluation is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud converged infrastructure and software defined storage it is in these areas that our data fabric strategy gives us an advantage

flash  flash plays a key role in customers’ it transformation efforts as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed responsiveness and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership allflash array technology is becoming the de facto technology for primary application workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash with a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of allflash array offerings netapp is well positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition 

hybrid cloud  netapp believes that the hybrid cloud will become the dominant model for enterprise it for years to come customers are attracted by the speed and scale benefits of the public cloud but need new data management capabilities to keep control of data as it moves beyond the walls of the enterprise our data fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers we enable our customers to manage secure and protect their data across flash disk and public and private cloud resources all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world 

converged infrastructure  due to budget constraints and skill imbalances our customers need greater support from their technology partners to evaluate integrate deploy and sustain the sophisticated solutions they need to stay competitive this trend is driving the demand for converged infrastructure solutions that reduce the time of deployment and lower integration risk netapp offers compelling business value through our flexpod ® converged solutions which reduce risks in ways that cannot be matched by the proprietary stacks offered by server vendors flexpod offerings created in partnership with cisco provide a broad range of reference architectures

netapp uses a multichannel distribution strategy we sell our products and services to enduser business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners we work with a wide range of partners for our customers – including technology partners valueadded resellers system integrators oems service providers and distributors during fiscal 2016 sales through our indirect channels represented 77 of our net revenues our global partner ecosystem is critical to netapp’s growth and success we are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers

as of april 29 2016 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5260 managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 45 countries sales to customers arrow electronics inc and avnet inc which are distributors accounted for 22 and 19 of our net revenues respectively in fiscal 2016 information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 16 – segment geographic and significant customer information of the notes to consolidated financial statements

seasonality

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

backlog

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

 

manufacturing and supply chain 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee san jose california guadalajara mexico san antonio texas schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

we were recently recertified to international organization for standardization iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certifications on october 8 2015 and continue to be iso 9001 and iso 14001 certified

research and development

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 861 million 920 million and 918 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

 

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services 

technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or cloud storage software as a service saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers led by aws provide customers storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems capital expenditure for the customers’ data centers which competes with more traditional storage offerings while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our c ustomers recognize the value in our cloud strategy our strategy includes building relationships with these new classes of providers and to date we have established relationships with more than 300 cloud service providers and hyperscaler providers including aws google ibm softlayer and microsoft azure 

the competitive storage landscape was further disrupted in 2015 by the october 2015 announcement that privately held dell inc planned to acquire publicly traded emc corporation one of our primary competitors as of this filing that transaction is still pending regulatory and shareholder approvals also in october 2015 hp split its business into two entities one of which hp enterprise continues to focus on the storage marketplace and compete with netapp another competitor pure storage went public in october 2015 

in addition to the competitors above we compete against hds ibm kaminario nimble storage nimbus data tegile tintri and violin memory in the oem market we compete against many of those same companies as well as seagate our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

we consider innovation and our technology partnerships key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase

proprietary rights

over the years netapp has been widely recognized for its innovation including recognition as one of the “world’s most innovative companies”  forbes ®   a top 300 united states patent holder intellectual property owners association and one of the best “quality over quantity” patent portfolios in its industry  ieee spectrum ®  we generally rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment 

over 1900 patents issued by and have over 680 patent applications pending with the us patent and trademark office as well as a correspond ing number of international patents and patent applications while the durations of our patents vary we believe that the durations of our patents are adequate relative to the expected lives of our products

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

 

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the carbon disclosure project cdp the cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors we have established employee commuter programs and education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would be material to our operations in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct an annual review and thirdparty verified audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

 

employees 

as of april 29 2016 we had approximately 12030 employees including approximately 1110 employees who have been notified that their employment is being terminated as part of our march 2016 restructuring plan of which 5260 were in sales and marketing 1250 were in customer support 3050 were in research and development 190 were in manufacturing operations and 1170 were in finance and administration none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors and other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

 

our business may be harmed by trends in the storage market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth the storage market did not experience growth in calendar years 2013 2014 or 2015 due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments at the same time that customers are navigating through their it transformations which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments they are also reducing it budgets looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume it this evaluation is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash hybrid cloud software as a service converged infrastructure and software defined storage our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace as a result of these and other factors discussed in the report our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline as it did in fiscal years 2014 2015 and 2016 on a yearover year basis the future impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for clustered data ontapbased products or other new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

we are currently devoting considerable effort and resources to introduce and gain customer acceptance for our clustered data ontap cdotbased products as well as to develop new generations of our ontap products the cdot storage operating system is the foundation for data management across flash disk and cloud storage systems and represents a fundamental and revolutionary change to our solution architecture and to our data fabric strategy over time our goal is to replace our data ontap 7mode technology with cdot and new generations of ontap we face considerable challenges as we continue to develop and market cdot including without limitation cost and complexity associated with migrating customer data and applications from legacy systems to cdotbased systems developing additional features for cdot currently available with data ontap 7mode and potentially required by our customers increasing sales of cdot through our channel and maintaining service support and customer relationships as we replace data ontap 7mode with cdot

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for cdot and other nextgeneration ontap products or any new products as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new software and flash product offerings such as cloud ontap storagegrid webscale all flash fas altavault and with our february 2 2016 acquisition solidfire subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to expand production capacity to meet the demand for new products our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products or the products being replaced in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers with a corresponding variety of sales cycles in addition the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners during fiscal 2016 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for 77 of net revenues this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue particularly within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel partners to promote our products could harm our operating results as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically require a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability

the continuing global economic uncertainty and political and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future and cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results

 

· seasonality such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year with the latter due in part to the impact of the us federal government’s september 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders and 

 

· linearity such as our historical intraquarter bookings and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total bookings and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter 

if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our gross margins vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mix of product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased component costs increased pricing pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices changes in product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenue mix or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines 

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses is fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including established public companies newly public companies with a strong flash focus and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyperconverged systems some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or cloud storage software as a service saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements cloud service providers led by aws provide customers storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems capital expenditure for the customers’ data centers which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape 

competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us by extending our flash and softwaredefined storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for additional information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain for example in october 2015 dell inc and emc corp announced their agreement to merge also in october 2015 hewlettpackard company split its business into two entities one of which hp enterprise continues to focus on the storage marketplace and compete with us in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners or suppliers

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected us in the past and in the future could negatively affect our revenues

a significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and 

marketing our products at an y time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adve rsely impacted 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

· limited ability to control the quality quantity and cost of our products or of their components 

 

· the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers that are higher than market rates 

 

· limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations 

 

· labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own 

 

· geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain 

 



 



such risks have in the past and could again in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by factors affecting our international operations but not experienced in the us including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as we ll as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign curre ncy exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our operating results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in our effective tax rate resulting from adverse outcomes from examination of our income tax returns andor changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries president obama and the us congress have called for comprehensive tax reform which among other things might change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed on foreign income additionally on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the us released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties on october 21 2015 the european commission ec concluded its investigations into tax ruling practices of certain european union eu member countries the ec concluded that certain member countries had granted unlawful rulings that artificially reduced tax burdens and has ordered the recovery of the unpaid taxes future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities

we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the us and foreign tax authorities have questioned our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements during these audits in recent years several other us companies have had their transfer pricing arrangements challenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the irs audits or audits being conducted in any other tax jurisdiction results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured and as a result we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in march 2014 may 2015 and march 2016 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities as a result we have recognized substantial restructuring charges we may in the future undertake initiatives that may include restructuring disposing of and or otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver produc ts and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangi ble or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities would ha rm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities 

if our products are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed

our products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products which could lead to a perception of a quality issue customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our end user customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers clients and partners to be secure there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in 1 unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information 2 litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities 3 negative publicity and 4 disruptions to our internal and external operations any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities in addition a cybersecurity incident or other security breach could result in other negative consequences including remediation costs disruption of internal operations increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues

our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms if our employees or our clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security 

measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities 

highprofile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting information technology products and businesses because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems

many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security breach whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense we have periodically reduced our workforce including an 11 reduction announced in february 2016 and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

a repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund us operations strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability

as of april 29 2016 48 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries under current law repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases dividends acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreignheld cash and incur a significant tax charge in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new 

business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business operating res ults and financial condition in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of these initiatives 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition additionally we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities for example in february 2016 we acquired solidfire inc and in fiscal 2015 we acquired the steelstore product line from riverbed technology inc the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems procedures and organizational structure any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition make the acquisition on favorable terms integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown in october 2013 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products and in our fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers in addition like other customers the us government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders andor to fully consummate our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio and in interest rates and impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit experiences prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

if we default under our debt obligations including our senior notes our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed moreover covenants associated with our senior notes and credit facilities may unduly restrict our business

we have senior notes outstanding as of april 29 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar 2017 2021 and 2022 we have also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 300 million under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april 29 2016 on february 2 2016 we entered into an 870 million unsecured term loan the proceeds of which were used to finance our acquisition of solidfire inc under which we had borrowings of 850 million principal amount outstanding as of april 29 2016 we may fail to pay these obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed

in addition all of our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain l iable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal daytoday operations such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results 

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported operating results

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements the increased use of fair value measures changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our operating results

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition reserves and allowances

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software maintenance services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software maintenance services we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and correspond ing uncertainties for recognizing revenue 

 



inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 



goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be less than its fair value the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying amount of each reporting unit and therefore found no impairment of goodwill

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets

 



product warranties

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary

the following are the key estimates and assumption s and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties 

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

discussion and analysis of results of operations

overview  — net revenues for fiscal 2016 were 5546 million a decrease of 577 million or 9 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting lower product revenues partially offset by an increase in software and hardware maintenance and other services revenues net revenues for fiscal 2015 were 6123 million down 202 million or 3 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting a decrease in product and software maintenance revenues partially offset by an increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2 percentage points during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting lower margins on product revenues gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2016 decreased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher discounting and product promotions which resulted in the decline in asps that outpaced the decline in unit materials costs gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher gross margins on hardware maintenance contract and other services revenues gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2015 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower asps for configured systems being offset by lower unit materials cost due to changes in product mix

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 totaled 2960 million an increase of 3 percentage points as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a lower revenue denominator partially offset by the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 totaled 3117 million up 2 percentage points as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a slight decrease in costs on a lower revenue denominator

net revenues in millions except percentages 

 



 

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of 669 million in product revenues partially offset by 92 million increase in total software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues product revenues comprised 54 of net revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to 60 of net revenues for fiscal 2015

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a reduction of 289 million in product revenues partially offset by 103 million increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues product revenues comprised 60 of net revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 62 of net revenues for fiscal 2014

sales through our indirect channels represented 77 78 and 79 of net revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues

 



product revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

product revenues consist of sales of configured systems which include bundled hardware and software products and nonconfigured products which consist primarily of addon storage oem products and addon hardware and software products

total configured system revenues of 1885 million decreased by 328 million or 15 and systems unit volume decreased by 3 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 revenues and unit volume decreased from fas entry level and midrange systems partially offset by an increase in revenues and unit volume from fas highend systems and eseries systems which include our all flash ef systems asps decreased across all fas systems and eseries systems platforms due primarily to a combination of higher discounting and product promotions introduced in fiscal 2016 asps were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 4 and unfavorable customer and product mix as a result overall asps of configured systems were lower in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

nonconfigured product revenues of 1101 million decreased by 341 million or 24 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 32 and 36 in addon storage and oem revenues respectively the decrease in addon storage reflects higher discounting and unfavorable product mix as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates the decrease in oem revenues reflects our move away from oem products 

total configured system revenues of 2213 million decreased by 74 million or 3 in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 revenues decreased in fas entry level midrange and highend systems partially offset by an increase in eseries systems total configured systems unit volume increased 5 primarily due to a unit volume increase in fas midrange highend systems and eseries systems platforms partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in fas entry level systems these changes in unit volume reflect a shift in customer demand to our newer fas midrange and highend systems and higher demand for our eseries systems and away from our older fas entry level systems asps decreased across all fas systems and eseries systems platforms due to a combination of newer lower priced products within their respective platforms and unfavorable foreign exchange rates which had an aggregate negative impact of approximately 2 on configured systems revenues in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a result overall asps of configured systems were lower in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

nonconfigured product revenues of 1442 million decreased by 215 million or 13 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 32 in addon storage revenues and a decrease of 20 in oem revenues partially offset by a 133 increase in addon software the decrease in addon storage and increase in addon software are largely due to the change in our pricing strategy that was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 whereby we now charge for operating system software for storage capacity but have lowered prices on storage hardware nonconfigured systems revenues were negatively impacted by 1 as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in t he open systems storage markets that we serve this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profits pricing changes discounting practices product competition foreign curren cy unit volumes customer mix natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues cost of revenues andor gross profits disk drive and flash storage materials are a significant component of our storage systems while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues 

software maintenance revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers

the fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts our software maintenance revenues were favorably impacted by a change in our pricing strategy effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 such that we now charge for software maintenance services on the storage capacity sold in our configured systems and addon storage products we expect this change to continue to result in favorable trends in our software maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues software maintenance revenues were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2016

hardware maintenance and other services revenues in millions except percentages

provision for income taxes in millions except percentages

 



 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 336 compared to an effective tax rate of 215 for fiscal 2015 and an effective tax rate of 139 for fiscal 2014 our effective tax rates reflect our corporate legal entity structure and the global nature of our business with a significant amount of our profits generated and taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate the effective tax rates for fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 were favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a 64 million income tax charge associated with the integration of solidfire into our worldwide operations as well as 20 million in charges related to the settlements of income tax audits as further discussed below

the effective tax rate of 336 in fiscal 2016 included a benefit of 81 million or 235 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a charge of 64 million or 186 percentage points related to the integration of solidfire intellectual property into our tax structure charges of 20 million or 58 percentage points in connection with the settlement of income tax audits a benefit of 14 million or 41 percentage points related to current and prior year research and development credits a tax charge of 13 million or 38 percentage points attributable to nondeductible stockbased compensation and a benefit of 10 million or 29 percentage points related to the domestic production activities deduction

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing calculations are key issues under audits in various jurisdictions and are often subject to dispute and appeals our open years in us federal jurisdictions are fiscal 2012 and later years in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2001 in that we have tax attribute carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustments in the tax years of utilization

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect on december 19 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax the danish tax examination agency appealed to the danish high court in march 2012 in february 2016 the danish high court referred the case to the european court of justice

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions we engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude certain statutes of limitations will lapse or both based on current information we do not expect significant changes to our existing unrecognized tax benefits as of april 29 2016 

 

 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements

 



 

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities 

 



 

cash flows

as of april 29 2016 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 53 billion reflecting a minimal decrease of 23 million from april 24 2015 the decrease was primarily due to 960 million in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock and 210 million in cash used for the payment of dividends partially offset by 974 million of cash provided by operating activities 102 million from the sale of properties and 148 million in proceeds from saleleaseback transactions of certain of properties additionally 870 million of cash was obtained through a shortterm loan which was primarily used to acquire solidfire accounts receivable dso was 54 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 46 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 reflecting seasonal shipment linearity working capital decreased by 13 billion to 28 billion as of april 29 2016 primarily as a result of the shortterm loan

cash flows from operating activities

during fiscal 2016 we generated cash from operating activities of 974 million reflecting net income of 229 million adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 279 million stockbased compensation of 260 million partially offset by adjustments for a deferred income tax provision of 113 million and a gain on sale of properties of 51 million 

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2016 included the following 





during fiscal 2015 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 consisted of net income of 560 million adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 307 million and stockbased compensation of 259 million

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2015 included the following







we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits or charges from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments

cash flows from investing activities

during fiscal 2016 we generated 982 million from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases expended 842 million of cash on the solidfire acquisition net of cash acquired paid 160 million for capital expenditures and received 102 million of proceeds from the sale of properties

during fiscal 2015 we used 645 million for purchases of investments net of maturities and sales and paid 175 million for capital expenditures in addition we expended 85 million of cash on acquisitions

cash flows from financing activities 

during fiscal 2016 we borrowed 870 million under a shortterm loan which was used primarily to fund the acquisition of solidfire we used 960 million for the repurchase of 33 million shares of our common stock 210 million for the payment of dividends and received 148 million of proceeds under saleleaseback transactions

during fiscal 2015 we generated 495 million net from the issuance of longterm debt and used 12 billion for the repurchase of 30 million shares of our common stock and 208 million for the payment of dividends

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 29 2016 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash we expect to generate from operations

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 29 2016 and april 24 2015 48 billion and 47 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 05 billion and 06 billion respectively were available in the us most of the amounts held outside the us can be repatriated to the us but under current law would be subject to us federal state income and foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings to fund cash requirements in the us we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state tax credit carryforwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the us and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs and invest in critical or complementary technologies and service interest and principal payments on our debt

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 29 2016

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties

senior notes 

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 29 2016 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

shortterm loan

in february 2016 in connection with our acquisition of solidfire we entered into a shortterm loan that matures on november 2 2016 that we expect to repay using funds generated by our global operations as of april 29 2016 850 million of the loan principal remained outstanding the loan is subject to the same covenants as our credit facility described below

credit facility

our credit facility under which we may borrow up to 300 million provides another potential source of liquidity the credit facility is an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility that terminates on december 21 2017 if no extensions have been requested by that time and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we may also subject to certain requirements request an increase in the facility up to an additional 50 million and request two additional oneyear extensions subject to certain conditions as of april 29 2016 no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the facility

we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 to be between 150 million and 200 million

dividends and stock repurchase program

on may 25 2016 we declared a cash dividend of 019 per share of common stock payable on july 27 2016 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 18 2016

as of april 29 2016 our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 96 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program under this program we can purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by our management the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time since the may 13 2003 inception of this program through april 29 2016 we repurchased a total of 247 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3285 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 81 billion as of april 29 2016 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 15 billion with no termination date which we plan to complete by may 2018

the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements

march 2016 restructuring plan

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan to streamline our business and reduce operating expenses we expect to incur approximately 45 million of additional cash expenditures in connection with this plan in the first two quarters of fiscal 2017

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 29 2016 in millions

 



 

 













some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

saleleaseback transaction

in fiscal 2016 we entered into s aleleaseback arrangements of certain of our land and buildings under which we leased back certain of our properties rent free over lease terms ending at various dates ranging from march 31 2017 to december 31 2017 unless terminated early by us due to the existence of a prohibited form of continuing involvement these properties did not qualify for saleleaseback accounting and as a result they have been accounted for as financing transactions under lease accounting standards under the financin g method the assets which had a net book value of 67 million at the date of the transactions will remain on our consolidated balance sheets and proceeds received by us from these transactions of 148 million are reported as financing obligations at the end of each respective leaseback period or when our continuing involvement under the leaseback agreements ends each transaction will be reported as a noncash sale of land and buildings and extinguishment of financing obligations and the difference between the then net book value of the properties and the unamortized balance of the financing obligations will be recognized as a gain on sale of properties these financing obligations are reflected as noncash obligations in the preceding commitments table 

financial guarantee instruments

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 29 2016 our financial guarantees of 14 million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets consisted primarily of standby letters of credit and surety bonds

financing guarantees 

while most of our arrangements for sales include shortterm payment terms from time to time we provide longterm financing to creditworthy customers we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize product revenues for these arrangements net of any payment discounts from financing transactions upon product acceptance we sold 243 million and 197 million of receivables during fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively

in addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products these leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the enduser customer if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through thirdparty financing institutions under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we defer revenues subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance and recognize revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights as of april 29 2016 and april 24 2015 the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant to date we have not experienced material losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements

we have entered into service contracts with certain of our enduser customers that are supported by thirdparty financing arrangements if a service contract is terminated as a result of our nonperformance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement we could under certain circumstances be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements as of april 29 2016 we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets  

indemnification agreements

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the thirdparties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 18 – commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

market risk and market interest risk

investment and interest income  — as of april 29 2016 we had debt investments of 24 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 29 2016 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 28 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securi ties of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments 

debt  — as of april 29 2016 we have outstanding 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility and shortterm loan  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 300 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and our shortterm loan borrowings under these arrangements accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under these arrangements as of april 29 2016 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility and 850 million was outstanding under the shortterm loan 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

sales principal markets and distribution channels

 

we market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world to increase visibility of netapp in the broader it segment we continue to make investments in our multiyear branding and awareness campaigns

 

our diversified customer base spans industry segments and vertical markets such as energy financial services government high technology internet life sciences healthcare services manufacturing media entertainment animation video postproduction and telecommunications netapp focuses primarily on the data management and storage markets we design our products to meet the needs of our broad customer base – from large enterprises to midsize customers

 

netapp uses a multichannel distribution strategy we sell our products and services to enduser business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners we work with a wide range of partners for our customers – including technology partners valueadded resellers system integrators oems service providers and distributors during fiscal 2015 sales through our indirect channels represented 80 of our net revenues our global partner ecosystem is critical to netapp’s growth and success we are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers

 

as of april 24 2015 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 7370 managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 50 countries sales to customers arrow electronics inc and avnet inc which are distributors accounted for 23 and 16 of our net revenues respectively in fiscal 2015 

information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 16 – segment geographic and significant customer information of the notes to consolidated financial statements

seasonality

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter

backlog

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

 

 

manufacturing and supply chain

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee olive branch mississippi schiphol airport the netherlands komarom and tiszaujvaros hungary wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion

we were most recently awarded international organization for standardization iso 9001 and iso 14001 certifications on september 15 2014 and continue to be iso 9001 and iso 14001 certified

research and development

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 9193 million 9173 million and 9042 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

 

competition

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hds hp and ibm in the oem market we compete against many of those same companies as well as dot hill and seagate through its acquisition of xyratex

by extending our flash and softwaredefined storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors smaller emerging storage vendors include nimbus data pure storage skyera solidfire and violin memory in the allflash array segment they include nexgen nimble storage tegile and tintri in the hybrid flash array segment the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors including emc hp and ibm 

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 

including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

the it storage market is also experiencing a change in the way storage services are consumed due to technology transitions and changing economic and business environments customers now have the option of engaging with cloud service providers to provide storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems for their data centers recent technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or cloud storage software as a service saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements while the short and longterm impact of these evolving trends cannot be predicted netapp is confident that our c ustomers recognize the value in our cloud strategy our strategy includes building relationships with these new classes of providers and to date we have established relationships with more than 300 cloud service providers and hyperscaler providers aws google ibm softlayer and microsoft azure 

we consider innovation and our technology partnerships to be key to our competitive differentiation we believe our competitive advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

 

environmental disclosure

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as complying with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the carbon disclosure project cdp the cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors we have established employee commuter programs and education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate 

change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would be material to our operations in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements of the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct an annual review and thirdparty verified audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

 

employees

as of april 24 2015 we had approximately 12810 employees of which 4380 were in sales and marketing 2990 were in customer support 3840 were in research and development 190 were in manufacturing operations and 1410 were in finance and administration none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors and other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future

our business may be harmed by trends in the storage market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes

our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth the storage market did not experience growth in calendar years 2013 and 2014 due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments recent technology trends such as the emergence of cloud storage software as a service saas flash storage and converged architectures are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements as a result of these and other factors discussed in the report our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline as it did in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 on a yearover year basis the future impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline andor if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for clustered data ontapbased products or other new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks

we are currently devoting considerable effort and resources to develop introduce and gain customer acceptance for our clustered data ontap cdotbased products cdot is our next generation storage operating system for our core products and represents a fundamental and revolutionary change to our solution architecture over time our goal is to replace our data ontap 7mode technology with cdot and consequently we anticipate that a majority of our revenues will ultimately derive from cdot we face considerable challenges as we continue to develop and market cdot including without limitation cost and complexity associated with migrating customer data and applications from legacy systems to cdotbased systems developing additional features for cdot currently available with data ontap 7mode and potentially required by our customers increasing sales of cdot through our channel and maintaining service support and customer relationships as we replace data ontap 7mode with cdot

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for cdot or any other new products as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

new or additional product introductions including new software and flash product offerings such as cloud ontap storagegrid webscale all flash fas flashray and steelstore subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences andor demand our ability to expand production capacity to meet the demand for new products our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products or the products being replaced in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers with a corresponding variety of sales cycles in addition the majority of our sales are made andor fulfilled indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners 

during fiscal 2015 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for 80 of net revenues this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue particularly within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel partners to promote our products could harm our operating results as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically require a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or if we were to cease business with them for these or other reasons our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability

the continuing global economic uncertainty and political and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad due to the financial and fiscal crises of recent years have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain additionally budgetary constraints and shifts in government spending priorities have caused and may in the future again cause governments including the us government to decrease purchases of storage equipment consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future and potentially cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results



 



if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our gross margins vary

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mix of product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased component costs increased pricing pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices changes in product software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenue mix or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses is fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results could be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services several of our key competitors have greater financial resources and offer a more diverse portfolio of products and services by extending our flash and softwaredefined storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors

for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 – business of part i of this annual report on form 10k it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results could be harmed

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results could be harmed

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected us in the past and in the future could negatively affect our revenues

a significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of distributors we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded consolidation among suppliers particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 



 



 



 



 



 



 



such risks have in the past and could again in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us in addition a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by factors affecting our international operations but not experienced in the us including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our operating results in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such 

violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in our effective tax rate resulting from adverse outcomes from examination of our income tax returns andor changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business the outcome of income tax audits and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions any of these factors could materially impact our operating results

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries president obama and the us congress have called for comprehensive tax reform which among other things might change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed on foreign income further recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities

we are currently undergoing income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the us and foreign tax authorities have questioned our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements during these audits in recent years several other us companies have had their transfer pricing arrangements c hallenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or audits being conducted in any other tax jurisdiction results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate

if our products are defective or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed

our products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results in addition we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products which could lead to a perception of a quality issue customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of 

information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our end user customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our products our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information and litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity which could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products additionally our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not regularly monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms therefore if employees clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems

many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security breach whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers in addition to increase revenues we will be required to develop a larger and more effective sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees or our inability to hire qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could be disruptive to our development efforts sales results business relationships andor our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results our board of directors is actively conducting a comprehensive search for a chief executive officer the prospective change in the office of the chief executive officer and any protracted delay in identifying that individual may cause disruption to our business and could adversely affect our business and operating results

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints events such as the us federal government shutdown in october 2013 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels has increased demand uncertainty for our products and in our fiscal 2014 resulted in lower sales to these customers if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

a repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund us operations strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability

as of april 24 2015 47 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries under current law repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases dividends acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreignheld cash and incur a significant tax expense in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions

in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives for example in may 2013 march 2014 and may 2015 we executed restructuring events designed to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business as a result we have recognized and expect in fiscal 2016 to recognize substantial restructuring charges we may in the future undertake initiatives that may include restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or a combination of these actions rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant 

changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders andor to fully consummate our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and operating results available cash and cash flows in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities in fiscal 2012 we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to engenio in fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisitions of cacheiq and iongrid and in fiscal 2015 we acquired the steelstore product line from riverbed technology inc the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition any failure to make the acquisition on favorable terms or any failure to integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our business and our operating results the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets

our oem relationships may not generate significant revenues

we have oem relationships with several companies which collectively accounted for 8 of our net revenues during fiscal 2015 compared to 9 during fiscal 2014 and 12 in fiscal 2013 these oems market and sell their branded solutions based on our unified solutions as well as associated software offerings while these arrangements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries we do not have exclusive relationships with our oems and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time we also compete with some of our oems further complicating our relationships with them therefore our relationships with these oems may not continue to generate significant revenues and our total revenues may continue to decline in addition we have no control over the products that the oems select to sell or their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio and in interest rates and impairment of our investments could harm our financial results

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit experiences prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

if we default under our debt obligations including our senior notes our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed moreover covenants associated with our senior notes may unduly restrict our business

we have senior notes outstanding as of april 24 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar 2017 2021 and 2022 we have also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 2500 million under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april 24 2015 we may fail to pay these obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed

in addition our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any 

outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage industry may harm our business

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions

if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal daytoday operations such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive 

advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters terrorist acts or other catastrophic events

we depend on the ability of our personnel inventories equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported operating results

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements the increased use of fair value measures changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 – description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition reserves and allowances

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software maintenance services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software maintenance services we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue

 



inventory valuation and purchase order accruals

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories

 



goodwill and purchased intangible assets

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit and therefore found no impairment of goodwill

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets

 



product warranties

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties

 



 

stockbased compensation

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straightline basis over the requisite service period

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our stockbased compensation

 



valuation of investment securities

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities

 



income taxes

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes

discussion and analysis of results of operations

overview  — net revenues for fiscal 2015 were 61227 million down 2024 million or 3 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting a decrease in product and software maintenance revenues partially offset by an increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues net revenues for fiscal 2014 were 63251 million down 73 million or less than 1 compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting a decrease in product revenues mostly offset by increases in software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 1 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher gross margins on hardware maintenance contract and other services revenues gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2015 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower average selling price asp for configured systems being offset by lower unit materials cost due to changes in product mix gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 3 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower unit materials costs due to supply chain efficiencies partially offset by lower asps for total configured systems additionally gross profit was favorably impacted in fiscal 2014 by lower oem revenues and higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 totaled 31167 million up 2 as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a slight decrease in costs on a lower revenue denominator sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 totaled 30965 million down 1 as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting cost control programs implemented in fiscal 2014 partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation due to higher achievement against plan

net revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a reduction of 2893 million in product revenues partially offset by 1031 million increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues product revenues comprised 60 of net revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 62 of net revenues for fiscal 2014

the slight decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2014 was due to a decrease of 1484 million in product revenues offset by an aggregate increase in software maintenance hardware maintenance and other services revenues of 1411 million product revenues comprised 62 of net revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 65 of net revenues for fiscal 2013

sales through our indirect channels represented 80 82 and 81 of net revenues in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively included in indirect channel sales were 4728 million 5847 million and 7872 million of oem revenues for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues

 



product revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

product revenues consist of configured systems which include bundled hardware and software products and nonconfigured products which consist primarily of addon storage oem products and addon hardware and software products

total configured system revenues of 22129 million decreased by 744 million or 3 in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 revenues decreased in fas entry level midrange and highend systems partially offset by an increase in eseries systems which include our all flash ef systems total configured systems unit volume increased 5 primarily due to a unit volume increase in fas midrange highend systems and eseries systems platforms partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in fas entry level systems these changes in unit volume reflect a shift in customer demand to our newer fas midrange and highend systems and higher demand for our eseries systems and away from our older fas entry level systems asps decreased across all fas systems and eseries systems platforms due to a combination of newer lower priced products within their respective platforms and unfavorable foreign exchange rates which had an aggregate negative impact of 458 million on configured systems revenues in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a result overall asps of configured systems were lower in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

nonconfigured product revenues of 14417 million decreased by 2149 million or 13 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 32 in addon storage revenues and decrease of 20 in oem revenues partially offset by a 133 increase in addon software the decrease in addon storage and increase in addon software are largely due to the change in our pricing strategy that was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 whereby we now charge for operating system software for storage capacity but have lowered prices on storage hardware nonconfigured systems revenues were negatively impacted by 211 million as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

total configured system revenues of 22873 million increased by 42 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 revenues from fas highend systems and eseries systems which include our all flash ef systems increased offset by decreases in fas entry level and midrange systems total configured systems unit volume increased 2 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of unit increases in the fas highend and midrange systems and eseries systems partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of the fas entry level systems reflecting a shift in customer demand to our newer midrange and highend products lower sales to the us public sector market and higher demand for our eseries systems the asps decreased across all fas system platforms in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to higher discounting and higher demand of newer lower priced products while the asp for eseries increased due to higher asps on allflash eseries systems overall asps of total configured systems decreased 1 during fiscal 2014 due to higher discounting and product mix

nonconfigured product revenues of 16566 million decreased 1526 million or 8 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from nonconfigured oem products which declined 26

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profits pricing changes discounting practices product competition foreign currency unit volumes customer mix natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues cost of revenues andor gross profits disk drive and flash storage materials are a significant component of our storage systems while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues

software maintenance revenues in millions except percentages

 



 

software maintenance revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers

the fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts our software maintenance revenues were favorably impacted by a change in our pricing strategy effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 such that we now charge for software maintenance services on the storage capacity sold in our configured systems and addon storage products we expect this change to continue to result in favorable trends in our software maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues

hardware maintenance and other services revenues in millions except percentages

  provision for income taxes in millions except percentages 

 



 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 215 compared to an effective tax rate of 139 for fiscal 2014 and an effective tax rate of 108 for fiscal 2013 our effective tax rates reflect our corporate legal entity structure and the global nature of our business with a significant amount of our profits generated and taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the us statutory tax rate the effective tax rates for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015 were favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the settlements of income tax audits as further discussed below

the effective tax rate of 215 in fiscal 2015 included a benefit of 1410 million or 198 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of 137 million or 19 percentage points related to current and prior year research and development credits an expense of 55 million or 08 percentage points attributable to nondeductible stockbased compensation an expense of 54 million or 08 percentage points related to state tax provisions and an expense of 464 million or 65 percentage points in connection with income tax audits

the effective tax rate of 139 in fiscal 2014 included a benefit of 1633 million or 220 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of 87 million or 12 percentage points related to current year research and development credits an expense of 98 million or 13 percentage points attributable to nondeductible stockbased compensation and an expense of 56 million or 08 percentage points related to state tax provisions

the effective tax rate of 108 in fiscal 2013 included a benefit of 1444 million or 255 percentage points from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of 121 million or 21 percentage points related to current year research and development credits and an expense of 184 million or 32 percentage points attributable to nondeductible stockbased compensation

on december 19 2014 the federal research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december 31 2013 and before january 1 2015 as a result of the extension in fiscal 2015 we recorded a benefit of 96 million related to the fiscal 2015 research credit and a benefit of 41 million related to a prior year credit that we will retroactively claim the federal research credit expired on december 31 2014

in july 2014 the internal revenue service irs completed the examination of our fiscal 2005 to 2007 income tax returns upon approval by the joint committee of taxation we recorded a 474 million income tax provision attributable to the audit settlement and related remeasurement of uncertain tax positions for tax years subject to future audits the audit adjustments resulted in lower earnings in our foreign subsidiaries which reduced the taxability of dividends that were previously repatriated from such subsidiaries due to this reduction in taxable dividends the conclusion of the fiscal 2005 to 2007 income tax audit resulted in a net refund of 80 million excluding interest 

in october 2014 the united kingdom’s uk’s tax authority concluded the examination of our fiscal 2009 to 2012 uk income tax returns we recorded a 10 million income tax benefit for the net impact of the audit adjustments and related release of unrecognized tax benefits 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing calculations are key issues under audits in various jurisdictions and are often subject to dispute and appeals the irs is currently auditing our fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax returns we expect the irs examination team to complete their field audit within the next twelve months however the resolution of the fiscal 2008 to 2010 income tax return audits may likely occur beyond the next twelve months should we choose to appeal the irs examination team’s audit findings 

our open years in us federal jurisdictions are fiscal 2008 and later years in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2001 in that we have tax attribute carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustments if and when utilized

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect on december 19 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax the danish tax examination agency appealed to the danish high court in march 2012 the danish high court hearing has not yet occurred 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions we engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude certain statutes of limitations will lapse or both given the uncertainties involved we estimate a potential decrease in our unrecognized tax benefit balance of up to 954 million may occur within the next 12 months associated with the potential settlements and statute lapses 

 

 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements

 



 

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities

 



 

cash flows

as of april 24 2015 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 03 billion from april 25 2014 to 53 billion the increase was primarily due to 4947 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and 12681 million of cash provided by operating activities partially offset by 11652 million in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock accounts receivable dso was 46 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 47 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 reflecting seasonal shipment linearity working capital increased by 2877 million to 41 billion as of april 24 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments

cash flows from operating activities

during fiscal 2015 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 consisted of net income of 5599 million adjusted by noncash depreciation and amortization of 3072 million and stockbased compensation of 2593 million

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2015 included the following







during fiscal 2014 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2014 consisted of net income of 6375 million adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 3341 million and stockbased compensation of 2730 million

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2014 included the following





we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits or charges from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments

cash flows from investing activities

during fiscal 2015 we used 6448 million for purchases of investments net of maturities and sales and paid 1753 million for capital expenditures in addition we expended 846 million of cash on acquisitions

during fiscal 2014 we generated 9750 million from maturities and sales of investments net of purchases and paid 2214 million for capital expenditures

cash flows from financing activities

during fiscal 2015 we generated 4947 million net from the issuance of longterm debt and used 12 billion for the repurchase of 296 million shares of our common stock and 2074 million for the payment of dividends

during fiscal 2014 we used 13 billion for the principal repayment of our convertible notes and used 19 billion for the repurchase of 473 million shares of our common stock and the purchase of a related forward contract and 2023 million for the payment of dividends

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends the impact of foreign exchange rate changes our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all

liquidity

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 24 2015 consisted of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash we expect to generate from operations

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist of the following in millions

 



 

as of april 24 2015 and april 25 2014 47 billion and 43 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 06 billion and 07 billion respectively were available in the us most of the amounts held outside the us can be repatriated to the us but under current law would be subject to us federal state income and foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings to fund cash requirements in the us we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state tax credit carryforwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the us and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs and invest in critical or complementary technologies and service interest and principal payments on our debt

the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 24 2015

our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties

senior notes

the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 24 2015 in millions

 



 

interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements

credit facility

our credit facility under which we may borrow up to 2500 million provides another potential source of liquidity the credit facility is an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility that terminates on december 21 2017 if no extensions have been requested by that time and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we may also subject to certain requirements request an increase in the facility up to an additional 1000 million and request two additional oneyear extensions subject to certain conditions as of april 24 2015 no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the facility

we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities

capital expenditure requirements

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be between 2250 million and 2750 million

dividends and stock repurchase program

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies

market risk and market interest risk

investment and interest income  — as of april 24 2015 we had debt investments of 34 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds us treasury and government debt securities and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 24 2015 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 45 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments

debt  — as of april 24 2015 we have outstanding 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 10 – financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 2500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 24 2015 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months see note 12 – derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities

seasonality 

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

  

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee olive branch mississippi schiphol airport the netherlands szekesfehervar and tiszaujvaros hungary longhua wuxi and tianjin china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers maximizing the exchange of critical information and facilitating implementation of joint quality programs we use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies and final system configuration this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion 

we were most recently awarded international organization for standardization iso 9001 and iso 14001 certifications on august 15 2013 and continue to be iso 9001 and iso 14001 certified 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world total research and development expenses were 9173 million  9042 million and 8282 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively these costs consist primarily of personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

competition 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hds hp and ibm in the oem market we compete against many of those same companies as well as dot hill and xyratex 

by extending our flash and softwaredefined storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors smaller emerging storage vendors include nimbus data skyera and violin memory in the allflash array segment and nexgen nimble storage tegile and tintri in the hybrid flash array segment the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large wellestablished competitors including emc hp and ibm 

  

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share the it storage market is also experiencing a recent change in the way that storage services are consumed due to technology transitions and changing economic and business environments customers now have the option of engaging with cloud service providers to provide storage as an operating expense rather than storage systems for their data centers recent technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or “cloud” storage software as a service saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements the impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns in the markets in which we compete is uncertain 

we consider innovation and our technological partnerships to be key to our competitive differentiation we are committed to being the bestinclass storage vendor and partnering with other industry leaders in delivering leading cloud converged infrastructure and integrated solutions that provide customers with the best applications and technologies available to offer customer support for our converged architectures we offer a cooperative support model with our partners 

we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance flexibility quality and operational efficiency we believe our advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase 

proprietary rights 

over the years netapp has been widely recognized for its spirit of innovation including recognition as one of the “world’s most innovative companies”  forbes  a top 300 united states patent holder intellectual property owners association and one of the best “quality over quantity” patent portfolios in its industry  ieee spectrum  we generally rely on patent copyright trademark trade secret and contract laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products while our intellectual property rights are important to our success we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark copyright license or other intellectual property right we have been granted or own by assignment over 1580 patents issued by and have over 660 patent applications pending with the us patent and trademark office as well as a corresponding number of international patents and patent applications while the durations of our patents vary we believe that the durations of our patents are adequate relative to the expected lives of our products

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

  

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we may be exposed to various risks related to such claims or legal proceedings also if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

environmental disclosure 

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our stockholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as to comply with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives 

we are voluntarily measuring monitoring and publicly reporting our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the carbon disclosure project cdp the cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors we have established employee commuter programs and education and awareness campaigns and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings labs and data centers at both the global and regionalstate levels various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs we are not subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would be material to our operations in the near future additionally we have implemented disaster recovery and business resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities business and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weatherclimaterelated phenomena such as earthquakes floods droughts and other such natural occurrences 

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements for the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach waste electrical and electronic equipment weee restriction of hazardous substances rohs and china rohs directives compliance we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 and maintain iso 14001 certification at three office locations globally as part of iso 14001 requirements we set local environmental performance goals such as reducing energy use per square foot and minimizing waste generated on site that are aligned with our overall corporate strategy we also conduct an annual review and third party verified audits of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws not only in our operations but also for our products

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend all information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future 

our business may be harmed by trends in the storage market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry technological and market changes 

our industry and the market in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage solutions by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and the resultant purchases of storage solutions to address this demand however despite continued data growth the storage market did not experience growth in calendar year 2013 due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions increased storage efficiency and changing economic and business environments recent technology trends such as the emergence of cloud storage software as a service saas and flash storage and converged architectures are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements the impact of these trends on both shortterm and longterm growth patterns is uncertain if the general historical rate of industry growth declines if the growth rates of the specific market in which we compete decline or if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products and solutions do not receive customer acceptance our business operating results and financial condition could suffer 

continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results including our revenue growth and profitability 

the continuing global economic uncertainty and political and fiscal challenges in the united states us and abroad due to the financial and fiscal crises of recent years have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain additionally budgetary constraints and shifts in government spending priorities have caused and may in the future again cause governments including the us government to decrease purchases of storage equipment consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future and potentially cause harm to our operating results such conditions have resulted and may in the future again result in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factor section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results 

 

  

 if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results 

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers with a corresponding variety of sales cycles in addition the majority of our sales are made indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners during fiscal 2014 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for 82 of net revenues this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue particularly within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically require a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results will be harmed 

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results will be harmed 

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines 

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses is fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 such risks have in the past and could again in the future subject us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed 

our gross margins vary 

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mix of product services and software entitlements and maintenance sem revenues increased component costs increased pricing pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices changes in product services and sem revenue mix or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals 

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for clustered data ontapbased products or other new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks 

  

we are currently devoting considerable effort and resources to develop introduce and gain customer acceptance for our clustered data ontapbased products cdot cdot is our next generation storage operating system for our core products and represents a fundamental and revolutionary change to our solution architecture over time our goal is to replace our existing technology data ontap 7mode with cdot and consequently we anticipate that a majority of our revenues will ultimately derive from cdot we face considerable challenges as we develop and market cdot including without limitation cost and complexity associated with migrating customer data and applications from legacy systems to cdotbased systems developing some features for cdot currently available with data ontap 7mode and potentially required by our customers and maintaining service support and customer relationships as we replace data ontap 7mode with cdot 

if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for cdot or any other new products as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

new or additional product introductions including new software and flash product offerings subject us to additional financial and operational risks including our ability to forecast customer preferences or demand our ability to expand production capacity to meet the demand for new products our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products or the products being replaced in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of priceperformance relative to products of competitors competitors’ responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results 

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services several key competitors have greater financial resources and offer a more diverse portfolio of products and services 

by extending our flash and softwaredefined storage offerings we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors in cloud and converged infrastructure we also compete with large well established competitors the longerterm potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined 

for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 busines s of this report it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners 

  

our oem relationships may not generate significant revenues 

we have oem relationships with several companies which collectively accounted for 9 of our net revenues during the fiscal 2014 compared to 12 during the corresponding period of the prior year these oems market and sell their branded solutions based on our unified solutions as well as associated software offerings while these arrangements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries we do not have exclusive relationships with our oems and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time we also compete with some of our oems further complicating our relationships with them therefore our relationships with these oems may not continue to generate significant revenues and our total revenues may decline in addition we have no control over the products that the oems select to sell or their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected us in the past and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 

for fiscal 2014 sales to distributors arrow electronics inc and avnet inc accounted for 22 and 16 respectively of our net revenues we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government 

the us government is an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints recent events such as the us federal government shutdown in october 2013 and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels has increased demand uncertainty for our products and has recently resulted in lower sales to these customers if the us government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the us government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government we take a variety of precautions to prevent our products from being shipped to ussanctioned targets however our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite such precautions 

for instance media reports starting in november 2011 asserted that certain of our products were delivered to syria through a thirdparty possibly in violation of us exportcontrol laws following these media reports we met with us government officials provided information at their request and expressed our willingness to continue cooperating with any further inquiry or investigation in april 2014 we were notified by the us government that it had completed its review of the matter and determined that we did not violate the us export laws and that the government had closed its inquiry into the matter however if in the future we are ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition as in the case of the media reports regarding syria described above even if we are not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal daytoday operations such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed 

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them a detailed description of these partnership relationships is identified in the business section of this annual report a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage industry may harm our business 

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with 

  

respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

if our products are defective our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed 

our products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service data loss or data corruption if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation loss of revenue inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results customers and we may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business 

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us for fiscal 2014 our international revenues accounted for 51 of our net revenues in addition a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by factors affecting our international operations but not experienced in the us including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our 

  

employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business and changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions any of these factors could materially impact our operating results 

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the united states countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax laws applicable to multinational corporations such as ours these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are currently undergoing income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements the us and foreign tax authorities have questioned our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements during these audits in recent years several other us companies have had their transfer pricing arrangements challenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies 

if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or audits being conducted in any other tax jurisdiction results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april 30 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole additionally our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders and to fully consummate our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to among other things our financial condition and results of operations available cash and cash flow in the us capital requirements and other factors future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares if we fail to meet any expectations related to dividends andor stock repurchases the market price of our stock could decline significantly and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time 

  

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits and may increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities in fiscal 2012 we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to engenio and in fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisitions of cacheiq and iongrid the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition any failure to make the acquisition on favorable terms or any failure to integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our results of operations or our business the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit experiences prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results for a summary of these investments and our management of the same please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in this document 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay 

beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default 

we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit provided lease financing arrangements or guaranteed lease payments under full recourse lease arrangements such events have caused us to incur bad debt charges in the case of financing arrangements have caused a loss of revenues and in the case of recourse lease arrangements have caused us to make payments to thirdparty financers we may be subject to similar losses in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

  

a repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund us operations strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability 

as of april 25 2014 43 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries under current law repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases dividends acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreignheld cash and incur a significant tax expense in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

if we default under our significant debt obligations including our senior notes and our recently issued notes our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed moreover covenants associated with our senior notes may unduly restrict our business 

we have senior notes outstanding as of april 25 2014 in an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar 2017 and 2022 we have also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 2500 million under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april 25 2014 in addition on june 5 2014 we issued 5000 million of senior notes that mature in calendar 2021 we may fail to pay these obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed 

in addition our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we have in the past and may in the future incur restructuring charges and asset impairment in response to changing market conditions or costcutting initiatives 

we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products for example in may 2013 and march 2014 we executed restructuring events designed to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business in light of the constrained it spending environment as a result we recognized substantial restructuring expenses we may in the future undertake initiatives that may include restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or both any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products these charges would harm our operating results in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities 

  

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees particularly our engineers salespeople and key managers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce modify or eliminate our equity programs due to increased shareholder activism heightened focus on corporate compensation practices or increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired 

  

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results 

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm 

  

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs we exercise little control over how our clients use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products 

our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us 

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business 

if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems or on our end user customer systems or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our employees customers clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage human error and technological vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity which could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products additionally our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not regularly monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms therefore if employees clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems 

many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat 

  

rooms and social media sites any security breach whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new customers cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements the increased use of fair value measures changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our results of operations

during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 473 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3978 per share for an aggregate of 19 billion we also declared cash dividends of 060 per share of common stock in fiscal 2014 for which we paid an aggregate of 2023 million 

restructuring plans

repurchases dividends capital expenditures working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions for further information on the terms of this debt issuance see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition reserves and allowances 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance sem and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software entitlements and support services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software entitlements and support services we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts 

  

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue 

 

   

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories 

 

 goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations 

  

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit and therefore found no impairment of goodwill 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

 product warranties 

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues when the related revenue is recognized we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary 

  

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties 

 

 stockbased compensation 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straightline basis over the requisite service period 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our stockbased compensation 

 

 valuation of investment securities 

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities arss which we classify as longterm investments as there is no active market and we believe our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain

 discussion and analysis of results of operations 

overview — net revenues for fiscal 2014 were 63251 million down 73 million or less than 1 compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting a decrease in product revenues mostly offset by increases in hardware maintenance contract and sem revenues 

net revenues for fiscal 2013 were 63324 million up 992 million or 2 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was due to increases in hardware maintenance contract and sem revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 26 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower unit materials costs due to supply chain efficiencies partially offset by a lower average selling price asp for total configured systems additionally gross profit was favorably impacted by lower oem revenues and higher margins on service revenues 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased less than 1 during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 totaled 30965 million down 1 as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting cost control programs implemented in fiscal 2014 partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation due to higher achievement against plan

 product revenues consist of configured systems which include bundled hardware and software products and nonconfigured products which consist primarily of addon storage oem products and addon hardware and software products please refer to the executive overview our company section for a description of how effective the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we aggregate our fas product platforms into entrylevel midrange and highend systems for reporting purposes 

total configured system revenues of 22873 million increased by 42 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 revenues from fas highend systems and eseries which includes our all flash ef systems increased offset by decreases in fas entry level and midrange systems total configured systems unit volume increased 16 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of unit increases in the fas highend and midrange systems and eseries systems partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of the fas entry level systems reflecting a shift in customer demand to our newer midrange and highend products lower sales to the us public sector market and higher demand for our eseries systems the average selling prices asp’s decreased across all fas system platforms in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to higher 

  

discounting and higher demand of newer lower priced products while the asp for eseries increased due to higher asps on allflash eseries systems overall asps of total configured systems decreased 1 during fiscal 2014 due to higher discounting and product mix 

nonconfigured product revenues of 16566 million decreased 1526 million or 8 during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from nonconfigured oem products which declined 26 

total configured system revenues of 22831 million increased by 634 million or 3 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues from fas entrylevel and highend systems partially offset by a decrease in fas midrange systems total configured systems unit volume increased 9 during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 unit volume for both the fas entrylevel and highend systems increased while unit volume of the fas midrange systems decreased reflecting a shift in customer demand from certain older midrange systems to certain entry level systems and increased demand for the highend systems the asp’s across all fas configured systems increased due to increased capacity during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 however asps of total configured systems decreased during fiscal 2013 due to a shift in sales from higher priced fas midrange systems to lower priced entry level systems 

nonconfigured product revenues of 18091 million decreased 1809 million or 9 during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from nonconfigured oem products which declined 11 and lower addon storage revenues 

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profits pricing changes discounting practices product competition foreign currency unit volumes customer mix natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues cost of revenues andor gross profits disks are a significant component of our storage systems while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues in millions except percentages 

 

 sem revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis as well as bug fixes and patch releases

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions transfer pricing is a key issue under audit in various jurisdictions and is often subject to dispute our fiscal 2005 through 2007 income tax returns are currently under audit by the irs on may 19 2014 we received a revenue agent’s report rar from the irs field examination team for the audit period the rar is subject to further review and approval by certain higher authorities within the irs before submission to the joint committee of taxation for final review and approval we expect to close our fiscal 2005 through 2007 income tax audit within the next twelve months our fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 income tax returns are currently under audit by the irs we are currently in the process of responding to inquiries from the irs examination team we expect the irs examination team to finish the field audit within the next twelve months in january 2014 the california franchise tax board temporarily closed the audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 income tax returns and will reopen the audit upon the conclusion of the applicable federal irs audits 

our open years in us federal jurisdictions are fiscal 2005 and later years in addition we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2000 in that we have tax attribute carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustments if and when utilized 

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect on december 19 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax the danish tax examination agency appealed the ruling to the danish high court in march 2012 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions as further discussed in note 13 

  

of the accompanying consolidated financial statements we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire or both given the uncertainties involved in all tax audits we can only determine a range of estimated potential increase in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from 235 million to approximately 459 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 25 2014 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

 

 the following is a summary of our cash flow activities 

 

 cash flows 

as of april 25 2014 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased by 19 billion from april 26 2013 to 50 billion the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the principal amount of our convertible notes of 13 billion and 19 billion in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock partially offset by 13 billion of cash provided by operating activities we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our operating cash flows and from working capital accounts receivable days sales outstanding as of april 25 2014 were 47 days compared to 42 days as of april 26 2013 working capital decreased by 08 billion to 38 billion as of april 25 2014 as a result of a decrease of 19 billion in current assets primarily due to the net decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments partially offset by a decrease of 11 billion in current liabilities primarily due to the maturity of our convertible notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

cash flows from operating activities 

during fiscal 2014 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2014 consisted of net income of 6375 million adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 3341 million and stockbased compensation of 2730 million

changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2013 included the following 

 

  

 we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits or charges from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 

cash flows from investing activities

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist of the following in millions 

 

   

as of april 25 2014 and april 26 2013 43 billion and 36 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by various foreign subsidiaries and was generally based in us dollardenominated holdings while 07 billion and 34 billion respectively was available in the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states can be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal state income and foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state tax credit carry forwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the united states and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies and service interest and principal payments on our debt 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of liquidity including potential future issuances of debt equity or other securities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

our investment portfolio including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties

 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually for further information on the underlying terms see note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

credit facility 

our credit facility under which we may borrow up to 2500 million provides another potential source of liquidity the credit facility is an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility that terminates on december 21 

  

2017 if no extensions have been requested at that time and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we may also subject to certain requirements request an increase in the facility up to an additional 1000 million and request two additional oneyear extensions subject to certain conditions as of april 25 2014 no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the facility 

we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which subsequent to yearend on june 5 2014 we completed a debt offering and raised 4947 million net of discount and offering costs through the issuance of longterm debt as further discussed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

capital expenditure requirements 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements our capital expenditures were 2214 million during fiscal 2014 we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be between 2000 million and 2500 million 

dividends and stock repurchase program 

on may 21 2014 we declared a cash dividend of 0165 per share of common stock payable on july 22 2014 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 10 2014

the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements 

  

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 25 2014 in millions 

 

  

    some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

market risk and market interest risk 

investment and interest income  — as of april 25 2014 we had debt investments of 27 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds commercial paper certificates of deposit us treasury securities and us government agency securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 25 2014 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our debt securities of approximately 27 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities arss due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 25 2014 our holdings in these securities had a par value of 369 million and an estimated fair value of 360 million the fair value of our arss may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our arss changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the market’s perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in the estimated fair value 

debt  — as of april 25 2014 we have outstanding 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change see note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 2500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 25 2014 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging 

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks as of april 25 2014 and april 26 2013 all contracts had a maturity of less than six months

to increase market share we are focused on diversifying our multichannel distribution strategy we are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new partnerships with system integrators and cloud service providers 

as of april 26 2013 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5940 managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 50 countries we employ a multichannel distribution strategy selling products and services to end users and service providers through a direct sales force and through channel partners including valueadded resellers system integrators oems and distributors during fiscal 2013 sales through our indirect channels represented 81 of our total net revenues sales to customers arrow electronics inc and avnet inc which are distributors accounted for 19 and 15 of our net revenues respectively in fiscal 2013 17 and 12 of our net revenues respectively for fiscal 2012 and 18 and 12 of our net revenues respectively for fiscal 2011 information about our segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue 

manufacturing and supply chain 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee olive branch mississippi schiphol airport the netherlands szekesfehervar and tiszaujvaros hungary shanghai and longhua china taoyuan city taiwan and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our 

  

suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing continuity of business this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion 

we were most recently awarded international organization for standardization iso 9001 and iso 14001 certifications on september 10 2012 and continue to be iso 9001 and iso 14001 certified 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world research and development expenses represented 14 of our net revenues in fiscal 2013 and 13 in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

competition 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services in the primary storage market our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation we primarily compete against these same companies in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup archival and compliance and business continuity segments 

by extending our portfolio with our ef540 flash array we are competing in a new market with both traditional competitors and new competitors particularly smaller emerging storage vendors both traditional and emerging storage vendors are gaining traction in this new market however the longerterm scope and competitive landscape of this market remain to be determined 

in markets such as cloud big data and converged infrastructure our primary competitors include emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm in the healthcare financial services life sciences and service provider markets we compete primarily with emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm some of our competitors in the primary and secondary storage markets also offer their systems to oem customers in addition we compete in the oem market against products from dothill and xyratex 

most fullstack vendors that sell storage started as server companies their ability to monetize their storage investment is limited by their server market share because their primary sales strategy is to attach storage to their server sales with such a cap on market opportunity we expect that over time the server companies will have difficulty sustaining investment in storage and data management additionally most storage companies have multiple overlapping architectures many of our competitors have multiple products that serve similar needs resulting in multiple code bases that have to replicate the same functionality diluting product development and management current product engineering and support costs and slowing their ability to innovate 

we consider innovation and our technological partnerships to be our key differentiators we are committed to being the bestinclass storage vendor and partnering with other industry leaders in delivering what we call the “innovation stack” an innovation stack from bestinclass vendors gives customers the best applications and technologies available to support our solutions for converged architectures we offer a cooperative support model with our partners 

  

in the oem market we compete based on the total offering we provide our partners which is focused on a commitment to their success they choose us for our products technology training and support through the sales and product lifecycles 

we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance flexibility quality and operational efficiency we believe our advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase 

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding intellectual property rights and we are exposed to various risks related to claims or legal proceedings related to intellectual property rights also if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

  

environmental disclosure 

we are committed to the success of our customers and partners to delivering value to our shareholders and to positively affecting the communities where our employees work and live we firmly believe that we can accomplish these objectives concurrently with our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility we are committed to the prevention of pollution efficient use of natural resources and minimizing relative to the growth of the company the environmental impacts from our operations products and services as well as to comply with laws and regulations related to these areas our environmental management system provides the framework for setting monitoring and continuously improving our environmental goals and objectives

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend all information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business operating results or financial condition the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face these risks can and will change in the future 

continuing uncertain economic conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results 

the continuing global economic uncertainty and related political and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad particularly the eurozone due to the debt and fiscal crises of recent years have among other things limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market and potentially constrains future access to capital for our suppliers customers and partners the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive affecting all participants in our industry and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain moreover a significant portion of our sales are to eurozone customers and accordingly we are particularly sensitive to developments in that region additionally fiscal restraints have caused and may in the future again cause governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets consequently we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future and potentially cause harm to our operating results and failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations 

when and if the current macroeconomic challenges are resolved we expect the risk of economic uncertainty to continue with the potential to restrict our visibility and harm our operating results 

our business may be harmed if growth in the storage market declines 

our industry has experienced significant historical growth due to the continuing increase in the demand for storage by consumers enterprises and government bodies around the world and our customers’ purchases of storage solutions to address this demand while it spending has fluctuated periodically due to technology transitions and changing economic and business environments overall growth in demand for storage has continued recent technology trends such as the emergence of hosted or “cloud” storage software as a service saas and mobile data access are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements the impact of these trends on overall longterm growth patterns is uncertain nevertheless if the general level of historic industry growth or if the growth of the specific markets in which we compete were to decline our business and results of operations could suffer 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially which could harm our common stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially all of the matters discussed in this risk factor section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year in addition to those matters we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results 

 

  

 if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and if disrupted could harm our operating results 

our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast we sell to a variety of customers with a corresponding variety of sales cycles in addition the majority of our sales are made indirectly through channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners during the year ended april 26 2013 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for 81 of net revenues this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue particularly within any particular fiscal quarter or year moreover our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners if their financial condition business or customer relationships were to weaken or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements our business and operating results could be harmed 

if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results will be harmed 

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve the level timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns or if we experience cancellations of significant orders our financial results will be harmed additionally due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not be able to accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could harm our operating results 

we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines 

we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth or decline we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could also harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we do not manufacture our products or their components instead we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components such as hard disk drives as well as for associated logistics our lack of direct responsibility for and control over these elements of our business as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers creates significant risks for us including among other things 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we have encountered some of these risks such as the 2011 thailand floods which subjected us to supply constraints price increases and minimum purchase commitments and expect to be subject to similar risks in the future when we do our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers becomes critical new manufacturers products components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality quantity or delivery requirements in a costeffective manner will harm our business operating results and customer relationships 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has subjected us and could in the future subject us to price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded when industry supply is constrained our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do accordingly our operating results may be harmed 

our gross margins vary 

our gross margins reflect a variety of factors including competitive pricing component and product design the volume and relative mixture of product services and software entitlements and maintenance sem revenues increased component costs increased pricing pressures the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product price changes in product services and sem revenue mixture or decreased volume could harm our revenues gross margins or earnings our gross margins are also impacted by quality failures and our sales and distribution activities including without limitation pricing actions rebates sales initiatives and discount levels and the timing of service contract renewals 

the costs of thirdparty components comprise a significant portion of our product costs while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings 

increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results 

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and consolidation we compete with many companies in the markets we serve over the last decade the expansion of market opportunities by large broadportfolio technology companies by vertical integration of storage products technologies and services such as the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle and through internal and external storagerelated corporate initiatives by companies such as hp dell and ibm has increased the number of large diversified technology companies with which we compete accordingly many of our key competitors have greater financial resources and offer a broad portfolio of it products and 

  

services fullstack vendors these competitors typically maintain broad and deep relationships with customers and partners across a diverse portfolio of products and services they may also be able to offer lower pricing or other preferred terms on storage system products due to these broader relationships we believe further storage market expansion by large diversified technology companies in addition to any future industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers as solesource vendors in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could harm our business and operating results a detailed description of storage and software products we compete with is identified in the business section of this annual report on form 10k 

there have been trends toward consolidation in the storage industry and market expansion by large broad technology companies for several years both of which have risks for us among other things the last few years have witnessed considerable consolidation in the disk drive industry an industry we depend upon for critical storage components we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving maturing industry as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms disk drive and other component manufacturing industry consolidations may lead to higher component prices and supply constraints for us which may in turn harm our operating results 

our oem relationships may not generate significant revenues 

we have oem relationships with several companies which collectively accounted for 12 of our net revenue during the year ended april 26 2013 these oems market and sell their branded solutions based on our unified solutions as well as associated software offerings while these arrangements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries we do not have exclusive relationships with our oems and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time we also compete with some of our oems further complicating our relationships with them therefore our relationships with these oems may not continue to generate significant revenues in addition we have no control over the products that the oems select to sell or their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing 

if our oem relationships increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oems or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts or if our oem relationships do not continue to generate significant revenues our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected in the past and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 

for the year ended april 26 2013 sales to distributors arrow electronics inc and avnet inc accounted for 19 and 15 respectively of our net revenues we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers resellers and distributors for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time in addition unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if any of our key customers resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products or stops purchasing our products altogether our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 

  

reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results in addition we could be harmed by claims that we or a channel partner have failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government 

the us government has become an important customer for us however government demand is uncertain as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints recent and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels has increased demand uncertainty for our products if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital it spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition as an example the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us we could face claims in the future violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results and financial position 

some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations ear administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government we take a variety of precautions to prevent our products from being shipped to ussanctioned targets however our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite such precautions for instance media reports starting in november 2011 have asserted that certain of our products were delivered to syria through a thirdparty possibly in violation of us exportcontrol laws we have publicly stated that we condemn any use of our products or technologies in syria we have notified the us government that we are conducting a review of these allegations and intend to cooperate fully with any government inquiry we have met with us government officials provided information at their request and expressed our willingness to continue cooperating with any further inquiry or investigation if we are found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position even if we are not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant financial and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal daytoday operations which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners our revenues may be harmed 

our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with 

  

them a detailed description of these partnership relationships is identified in the business section of this annual report a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market however there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and these relationships may not be exclusive may not generate significant revenues and may terminate on short notice for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners moreover some of our partners particularly large more diversified technology companies are also competitors complicating our relationships if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us we could experience lower than expected revenues suffer delays in product development or experience other harm to our operating results and business 

our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage industry may harm our business 

emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

if our products are defective our gross margins operating results and customer relationships may be harmed 

our products are complex we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future quality issues quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products as we discuss in the next risk factor if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins business and operating results we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

if we are unable to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for clustered data ontap or other new products while managing the transition from older products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks 

we are currently devoting considerable effort and resources to develop introduce and gain customer acceptance for our clustered data ontapbased products cdot cdot is our next generation storage operating system for our core products and represents a fundamental and revolutionary change to our solution architecture over time our goal is to replace our existing technology data ontap 7mode with cdot and consequently we anticipate that a majority of our revenues will ultimately derive from cdot we face considerable challenges as we develop and market cdot including without limitation cost and complexity associated with migrating customer data and applications from legacy systems to cdotbased systems 

  

development of some features for cdot currently available with data ontap 7 and potentially required by our customers and maintaining service support and customer relationships as we replace data ontap7 with cdot 

nevertheless if we are unable for technological customer reluctance or other reasons to develop introduce and gain market acceptance for cdot or any other new products as and when required by the market and our customers our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

new or additional product introductions also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues and subject us to additional financial and operational risks in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands if these risks are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business 

a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us for the year ended april 26 2013 our international revenues accounted for 50 of our total revenues in addition a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by factors affecting our international operations but not experienced in the us including among other things local political or economic conditions trade protection and export and import requirements local labor conditions transportation costs government spending patterns acts of terrorism international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business 

  

operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control these factors include among other things fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business and changes to the tax regulations in such jurisdictions any of these factors could materially impact our operating results 

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the president’s administration and congress have announced several proposals to reform us tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of us income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings should such antideferral provisions be enacted our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 

we are currently undergoing income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement in recent years several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies 

if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april 30 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

our convertible note conversion may adversely affect our results of operations particularly our earnings per share 

any conversion of the convertible notes may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share if the average trading price of our common stock in each fiscal quarter exceeds the conversion price of 3185 per share the convertible notes will cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share the convertible note hedge transactions discussed below if exercised upon conversion of the convertible notes are expected to reduce approximately 80 of the common stock potentially issuable on conversion of the convertible notes upon conversion of any convertible notes we are required to deliver cash 

  

up to the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which will result in dilution to our stockholders as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements in june 2013 we issued 49 million shares in connection with the settlement of the convertible notes and received 39 million shares in connection with the exercise of the convertible note hedges 

the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the convertible notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with these hedging transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the convertible notes the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our stockholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the convertible notes and warrants as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements in june 2013 we exercised the convertible note hedges and settled our convertible notes 

future issuances of common stock related to our convertible notes warrants and employee equity awards may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the convertible notes 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes any new issuance of equity securities including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the convertible notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our convertible note hedges could dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their convertible notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the convertible notes in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements in june 2013 we issued 49 million shares in connection with the settlement of the convertible notes and received 39 million shares in connection with the exercise of the convertible note hedges 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

  

moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our stock 

our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits increase our liabilities disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 

as part of our strategy we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities in fiscal 2011 we completed acquisitions of two technology companies in fiscal 2012 we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to engenio and in fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisitions of cacheiq and iongrid the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate the terms of acquisition and integrate the acquired business any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition any failure to make the acquisition on favorable terms or any failure to integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us increase our costs disrupt our operations result in additional liabilities investigations and litigation and may also harm our strategy our results of operations or our business the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit experiences prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results for a summary of these investments and our management of the same please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in this document 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay 

beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default 

we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit provided lease financing arrangements or guaranteed lease payments under full recourse lease arrangements such events have caused us to incur bad debt charges in the case of financing arrangements have caused a loss of revenues and in the case of recourse lease arrangements have caused us to make payments to thirdparty financers we 

  

may be subject to similar losses in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that the continuing turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

any repatriation of our overseas cash to fund us operations strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability 

as of april 26 2013 36 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in foreign countries under current law dividend repatriation of any of this cash would trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases dividends acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreignheld cash and incur a significant tax expense in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

if we default under our significant debt obligations including our convertible notes and senior notes our business results of operations and financial condition will be harmed moreover covenants associated with our convertible notes and senior notes may unduly restrict our business 

we have convertible notes outstanding in the principal amount of 1265 billion that mature on june 1 2013 and senior notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar 2017 and 2022 we have also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 2500 million under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april 26 2013 we may fail to pay these obligations as and when required specifically if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt our business results of operations and financial condition will be harmed as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements in june 2013 we repaid the principal amount of our convertible notes 

in addition our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements moreover compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we may incur asset impairment and restructuring charges in response to changing market conditions or costcutting initiatives 

we may undertake cost savings initiatives in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products these initiatives may include restructuring disposing of andor otherwise discontinuing certain products or both any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with among other things inventory or other fixed intangible or goodwill asset reductions including without limitation impairment charges workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products these charges would harm our operating results we have previously recognized restructuring and other charges associated with these activities in addition to the costs associated with these activities we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the same 

  

we could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth 

while we have historically grown rapidly primarily through organic initiatives our acquisition activity has been ongoing and we expect to continue to look for opportunities to supplement our organic growth through strategic initiatives 

our growth has at times led to both organizational change and strain we may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change which may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources and systems we incur significant expenditures of funds and the allocation of management and other resources to manage our growth and assimilate new human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and our reputation in the marketplace we may experience periods when our pace of growth exceeds the capacity and capabilities of our organization and systems if we do not effectively manage our growth through costeffective organizational and system programs our corporate culture could be undermined the quality of our products and customer service could suffer and our reputation could be harmed each of which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including by moving activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including by moving our business activities from highercost to lowercost locations outsourcing certain business processes and functions and implementing changes to our business information systems these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes in addition as we move operations into lowercost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and as a consequence become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of thirdparties if we are unable to move our operations outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards controls and procedures the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business and operating results could be harmed 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley is intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees particularly our engineers salespeople and key managers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we reduce or eliminate our equity programs due to increased shareholder activism heightened focus on corporate compensation practices or increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such programs we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 

in addition because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

  

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters including fires floods hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes power loss or shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures or breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired 

our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends significantly upon developing maintaining and protecting proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers to protect our proprietary rights we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

changes in regulations relating to our products or their components or the manufacture sourcing distribution or use thereof may harm our business and operating results 

the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing sourcing distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time for example in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change our costs are likely to rise and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions litigation risks and reputational harm 

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 

our clients including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs we exercise little control over how our clients use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products 

our clients may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their data on our systems because we do not control the transmissions between our clients their customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing errors or wrongdoing by clients their customers or thirdparty technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us 

a failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business 

if our security measures are breached or if stored data is improperly accessed customers may reduce or cease using our solutions our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 

we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our employees clients and partners including thirdparty vendors such as data centers and providers of saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth and their respective customers including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information security breaches could result in unauthorized access to or loss or unauthorized disclosure of such information litigation indemnity obligations government investigations and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity which could damage our reputation additionally our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data we do not regularly monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store and therefore we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms therefore if employees clients partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of third 

  

party action employee error malfeasance stolen or fraudulently obtained login credentials or otherwise our reputation could be damaged our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems 

many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative publicity moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites any security breach whether actual or perceived could harm our reputation erode client confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures negatively impact our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to elect not to renew their support contracts or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other action or liability which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements the increased use of fair value measures changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our results of operations

recent activity

the convertible notes matured on june 1 2013 at the time of settlement we delivered 1265 billion in cash to the holders for the outstanding principal amount and issued 49 million shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value in addition we exercised the convertible note hedges for which we received 39 million shares from the counterparties 

dividends and share repurchase program 

on may 21 2013 we announced a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share of common stock beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 with the first dividend payable on july 23 2013 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 11 2013 

  

in may 2013 we announced an increase of 16 billion to our stock repurchase program resulting in an aggregate remaining program of 30 billion program more information about our stock repurchase program is included in “liquidity and capital resources” 

accelerated share repurchase agreement 

on june 5 2013 we entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement asr with a counterparty under which we prepaid 7500 million to purchase shares of our common stock in exchange for the upfront payment the counterparty committed to deliver a number of shares during the asr’s purchase period which ends no later than august 29 2013 although the completion date may be accelerated at the counterparty’s option the total number of shares to be delivered and therefore the average price per share will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of our stock during that period 

fiscal 2014 restructuring plan 

on may 15 2013 we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to realign resources reducing our global workforce by approximately 900 employees in connection with this plan we anticipate incurring between 500 million and 600 million in employee severance and other restructuring charges 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition reserves and allowances 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products which generally includes a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance sem and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over their contractual terms generally from one to five years 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the 

  

deliverables using best estimate of selling price besp for our software entitlements and support services we generally use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software entitlements and support services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue 

 

   

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories 

 

 goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations 

  

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit and therefore found no impairment of goodwill 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

 product warranties 

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues when the related revenue is recognized we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary 

  

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties 

 

 stockbased compensation 

we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards net of an estimated forfeiture rate we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period 

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our stockbased compensation 

 

 valuation of investment securities 

our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax unless they are determined to be otherthantemporary impairments the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities ars which we classify as longterm investments as there is no active market and we believe our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain 

  

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities 

 

 income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

 

 the following is a summary of our cash flows 

 

 cash flows 

as of april 26 2013 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 16 billion from april 27 2012 to 70 billion the increase was primarily a result of 14 billion of cash provided by operating activities and 10 billion of proceeds net received from the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 06 billion in cash paid for the repurchase of common stock and an aggregate 04 billion in capital expenditures and business acquisitions we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our operating cash flows and from working capital accounts receivable days sales outstanding as of april 26 2013 decreased to 42 days compared to 44 days as of april 27 2012 primarily due to improvements in shipment linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year working capital increased by 13 billion to 46 billion as of april 26 2013 primarily due to the net increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as a result of the issuance of the longterm debt

 as of april 26 2013 34 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the united states while 36 billion was held in foreign countries most of the amounts held outside the united states can be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal and state income taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the united states and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies and service interest and principal payments on our debt our contractual obligations as of april 26 2013 are summarized below in the contractual obligations table 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt based on past performance and our current business outlook we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months we anticipate the cash used to settle the principal amount of our convertible notes due june 1 2013 will come from our domestic cash we anticipate the cash used for future dividends and share repurchases will come from our domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing domestic operating activities however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

our investment portfolio including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other potential sources of cash we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions debt obligations or other cash requirements we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties our gross exposures to our investments in greece italy portugal and spain are individually and collectively not material

capital expenditure requirements 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in north carolina india california and other locations worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed our capital expenditures were 3033 million during fiscal 2013 we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be between 2250 million and 2750 million

market risk and market interest risk 

investment and interest income  — as of april 26 2013 we had debt investments of 37 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase which are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds commercial paper certificates of deposit us treasury securities and us government agency securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 26 2013 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixedincome securities of approximately 45 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairments 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities ars due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 26 2013 our holdings in these securities had a par value of 449 million and an estimated fair value of 420 million the fair value of our ars may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our ars changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the market’s perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in the estimated fair value 

debt  — as of april 26 2013 we have outstanding 1265 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in june 2013 and 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in december 2017 and december 2022 we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates see note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information 

credit facility  — we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our 2500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our senior notes consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility as of april 26 2013 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities we also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging 

we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than six months

seasonality 

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue 

manufacturing and supply chain 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee olive branch mississippi livingston scotland schiphol airport the netherlands szekesfehervar hungary shanghai and longhua china taoyuan city taiwan singapore and guadalajara mexico these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing continuity of business this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion 

we were awarded iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be iso 9001 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004 and continue to be iso 14001 certified 

  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 research and development expenses represented 13 13 and 14 of our net revenues respectively these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we might acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

competition 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services in the primary storage market our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation we compete against these same companies in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup archival and compliance and business continuity segments in markets such as cloud big data and converged infrastructure our primary competitors include emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm in the healthcare financial services life sciences and service provider markets we compete primarily with emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm some of our competitors in the primary and secondary storage markets also offer their systems to oem customers in addition we compete in the oem market against products from dothill and xyratex 

most fullstack vendors that sell storage started as server companies their ability to monetize their storage investment is limited by their server market share because their primary sales strategy is to attach storage to their server sales with such a cap on market opportunity we expect that over time the server companies will have difficulty sustaining investment in storage and data management however most storage companies have multiple overlapping architectures many of our competitors have multiple products that serve similar needs resulting in multiple code bases that have to replicate the same functionality diluting product development and management current product engineering and support costs and slowing their ability to innovate 

we consider innovation and our technological partnerships to be our key differentiators we are committed to being the bestinclass storage vendor and partnering with other industry leaders in delivering what we call the “innovation stack” an innovation stack from bestinclass vendors gives customers the best applications and technologies available to support our solutions for converged architectures we offer a cooperative support model with our partners 

in the oem market we compete based on the total offering we provide our partners which is focused on a commitment to their success they choose us for our products technology training and support through the sales and product lifecycles 

we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance flexibility quality and operational efficiency we believe our advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase 

an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see item 1 business — forward looking statements of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of the forwardlooking statements that are qualified by these risk factors if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain economic and market conditions 

we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide or in certain geographic regions such as the continuing fiscal challenges in the united states and europe have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of the abovementioned factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations during times of economic volatility these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 due to such factors operating results for future periods are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

  

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast and a shortfall in revenues may harm our business and our operating results 

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast especially in times of economic uncertainty because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and we rely increasingly on sales through our indirect channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners new product introductions and the transition from old to new products also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 

in addition we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets our financial results will be adversely impacted additionally due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast bookings and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment and also because customers’ purchasing decisions are subject to delay reduction or cancellation small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in addition the risks inherent in using a pipeline system are magnified with respect to indirect sales made through our channel partners because we have less control over and visibility into the sales process of our channel partners 

economic uncertainties have caused and may in the future again cause consumers businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets credit decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence accordingly future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

supply chain and logistics issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities supply chain and logistics exposes us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components utilized in the assembly of our products including certain single source suppliers which has and could subject us to future price rigidity periodic supply constraints and the inability to produce our products if our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers experience strikes protests or other labor unrest or are subject to lawsuits injunctions or other legal challenges there may be delays interruptions or permanent impairment in the ability of such manufacturers and suppliers to ship products to us or such manufacturers and suppliers may incur increased costs any of which could impact our business and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition 

for instance several of our disk drive suppliers with operations in thailand were impacted by the october 2011 flooding which affected those suppliers’ ability to manufacture a sufficient number of drives in order to meet the demands of their customers including us in addition certain suppliers also increased prices for 

  

available drives drive supply shortages and pricing complexities could materially and adversely affect our supply chain customer relationships and results of operations qualifying new contract manufacturers and commencing volume production is expensive and timeconsuming and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity with respect to any contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture sell and ship our products 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately procure inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to timely cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs perceived or real problems with product quality control or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease as the demand for our products has increased we have experienced and may continue to experience tightening of supply of some components leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints which has resulted in and in the future could continue to result in the delay of shipments 

our business operations are subject to business interruptions and other events beyond our control such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 

we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 

changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a challenging operating environment for our business it is critical that we maintain appropriate alignment between our cost structure and our expected growth and revenues while at the same time continuing to make strategic investments for future growth 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits such as revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

conversely if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products we could also experience an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition and our customer relationships may be adversely impacted if the storage and data management market fails to grow or grows slower than we expect our revenues will be adversely affected 

our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary and such variation makes it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of our product software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues 

  

our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

  

 changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 due to such factors gross margins are subject to variation from periodtoperiod and are difficult to predict 

an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services fullstack vendors and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services in the primary storage market our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation we compete against these same companies in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup archival and compliance and business continuity segments in markets such as cloud big data and converged infrastructure our primary competitors include emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm in the healthcare financial services life sciences and service provider markets we compete primarily with emc hitachi data systems hp and ibm some of our competitors in the primary and secondary storage markets also offer their systems to oem customers in addition we compete in the oem market against products from dothill and xyratex 

  

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers as solesource vendors in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales 

if we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our channel partners or if our channel partners fail to effectively manage the sale of our products or services on our behalf our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

we market and sell our storage data management solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect channels during fiscal 2012 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for 78 of net revenues in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 

several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our indirect channel distribution model which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins including the following 

 

  

  

  

 the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new indirect channel partners retain these indirect channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement indirect channel partners in the future especially in light of continued changes in end customer demand patterns and changes in available and competing technologies from competitors our inability to effectively establish train retain and manage our indirect channel partners could harm our sales 

in addition we depend on our indirect channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

  

our oem relationships may not continue to generate significant revenues 

we have oem relationships with ibm teradata fujitsu technology solutions fujitsu oracle and dell which enable these oems to market and sell their branded solutions based on our unified solutions as well as associated software offerings or in the case of fujitsu enables fujitsu to lease sell market and resell our products to end users and fujitsu sales partners worldwide to integrate our products into fujitsu bundled offerings and to market our support services while these arrangements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries we do not have exclusive relationships with our oems and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore our relationships with these oems may not continue to generate significant revenues in addition we have no control over the products that the oems select to sell or their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing 

as our oem relationships increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oems or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts or if our oem relationships do not continue to generate significant revenues our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 

during fiscal 2012 sales to distributors arrow electronics inc and avnet inc accounted for approximately 17 and 12 respectively of our net revenues we also have significant oem agreements as discussed above the loss of orders from these or any of our more significant customers strategic partners distributors or resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer 

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for extended periods of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 

unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if the uncertainty in the economy continues or conditions deteriorate and our sales decline our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to or unexpected returns from customers and resellers or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business we expect that our largest customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today end users could stop purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing our products at any time the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter could harm our operating results in addition a change in the pricing practices of one or more of our large indirect channel partners could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 

  

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us future revenues from the us government are subject to shifts in government spending patterns a decrease in government demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our revenues in addition our business could be adversely affected by claims that we or a channel partner have failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage and data management market generally and for us in particular however government demand is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending particularly in light of recent and continued uncertainties about us spending levels if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

selling our products to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results and financial position as an example the united states department of justice “doj” and the general services administration “gsa” have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors including us and several of our competitors and channel partners under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government the doj and gsa continue to pursue actively such claims we are currently discussing contract compliance matters regarding sales made through a channel partner with the doj and gsa and have produced documents and met with the doj and gsa on several occasions if the doj determines to initiate an action against a channel partner andor us we would be subject to litigation could be subjected to fines and penalties we could also decide to pay the doj a settlement either to avoid a potential action or in termination of an action violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results and financial position 

certain of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered if we were found to have violated these laws the consequences of such a determination could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations ear administered by the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include significant monetary fines criminal proceedings against us and our officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government we take a variety of precautions to prevent our products from being shipped to ussanctioned targets however our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite such precautions for instance media reports starting in november 2011 have asserted that certain of our products were delivered to syria through a thirdparty possibly in violation of us exportcontrol laws we have publicly stated that we condemn any use of our products or technologies in syria we have notified the us government that we are conducting a review of these allegations and intend to cooperate fully with any government inquiry we have met with us government officials provided information at their request and expressed our willingness to continue cooperating with any further inquiry or investigation if we become the subject of an investigation and are found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of 

  

which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position even if we are not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant financial and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal daytoday operations which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenues may be impacted negatively 

an element of our strategy to increase revenues is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them we have significant partner relationships with database business application backup management and server virtualization companies including microsoft cisco oracle sap symantec and vmware a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners these partnerships may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time if these relationships are not maintained or fail to materialize as expected we could experience lower than expected revenue growth suffer delays in product development or experience other operational difficulties 

in addition some of our partners including oracle cisco and vmware are also partnering with other storage vendors which may increase the availability of competing solutions harm our ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data management solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships our future revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if the performance of these markets do not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues or if we are unable to develop product offerings that meet the future demands of these markets our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets the markets for storage and data management have been recently adversely impacted by the global economic uncertainty and as a result of continued uncertainty the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline also even if spending in the it market increases our revenues may not grow at the same pace 

additionally emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

  

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause substantial fluctuation in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies certain macroeconomic factors such as the market climate for the technology sector changes in interest rates and levels of corporate spending on it could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance if we fail to manage the interoperability and transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues and subject us to additional financial and operational risks if they are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must attempt to successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

  

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues gross margins and operating results 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

in addition if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs and these occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues gross margins and operating results we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although a substantial portion of our business is located and conducted in the us a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the us during fiscal 2012 our international revenues accounted for 51 of our total revenues a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts in addition we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis these hedging contracts attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have a negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include inaccuracies in forecasting widening interest rate differentials and volatility in the foreign exchange market our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged nonus currencies in which we transact business 

as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk should there be a counterparty default we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 

  

in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations and regulations related to data privacy we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the president’s administration and congress have announced several proposals to reform us tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of us income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings should such antideferral provisions be enacted our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 

  

we are currently undergoing income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement in recent years several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies 

on march 26 2012 we received a revenue agent’s report from the irs for our fiscal 2005 through 2007 tax returns on april 25 2012 we filed a protest related to transfer pricing matters our fiscal 2008 through 2010 tax returns are currently under audit by the irs 

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect on december 19 2011 the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax the danish tax examination agency appealed to the danish high court in march 2012 

we are in various stages of the examination and appeals process in connection with tax audits worldwide and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled it is reasonably possible that over the next twelvemonth period we may experience an increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits it is not possible to determine either the magnitude or the range of any increase or decrease at this time 

if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april 30 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

our leverage and debt service obligations and note conversion may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our notes we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past in addition we have various synthetic lease arrangements related to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale california and subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financing agreements we may incur additional debt 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms 

  

any conversion of the notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share if the average trading price of our common stock in any fiscal quarter exceeds the conversion price of 3185 per share the notes will cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share based on the trading price of our common stock as of april 27 2012 we had approximately 7 million shares of common stock potentially issuable on conversion of our notes the note hedge transactions discussed below if exercised upon conversion of the notes are expected to reduce approximately 80 of the common stock potentially issuable on conversion of the notes upon conversion of any notes we would be required to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders 

the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with these hedging transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our shareholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in april 2010 we terminated our note hedge transaction with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc lehman otc which was a counterparty to 20 of our note hedges as a result of the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc which constituted an event of default under the note hedge because we have decided not to replace this note hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 the terms of the notes the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination of this note hedge 

the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the notes and warrants 

future issuances of common stock related to our notes warrants stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the notes 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold for the notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2012 accordingly as of april 27 2012 the notes were convertible at the option of the holder the determination of whether or not the notes are convertible must continue to be performed quarterly upon conversion of any notes we would be required to deliver cash for the principal amount of the notes and 

  

shares of common stock if any to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount any new issuance of equity securities including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our note hedges could dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

as of april 27 2012 eligible individuals under our stock option and restricted stock unit plans held options to purchase approximately 21 million shares of our common stock and a total of approximately 12 million restricted stock units if all the outstanding options were exercised the proceeds to the company would average approximately 30 per share we also had 15 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock plans with respect to equity awards that have not been granted the exercise of all of the outstanding options andor the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

as of april 27 2012 we had approximately 5 million shares of our common stock available for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan espp the issuance of shares under the espp would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock in addition the espp includes a purchase price adjustment provision such that employees who elect to participate are granted options to purchase common stock at a 15 discount from the market value of the common stock at certain specified dates within a twoyear offering period if the adjustment is triggered due to a decline in the market value of our common stock we could incur a significant noncash charge in our statement of operations for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we recorded an expense related to the purchase price adjustment provision of 109 million 

we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons including to finance our operations related to business strategy including in connection with acquisitions strategic alliances or other transactions to increase our capital to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options upon conversion of the notes or for other reasons 

our acquisitions may disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities in fiscal year 2011 we completed acquisitions of two technology companies and in fiscal 2012 we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to engenio the acquisition and ongoing integration of new businesses into our business may adversely affect our operations and profitability we may not achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies or realize our estimated revenue gross margin profit or other financial projections or business objectives in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets for example we have in the past discontinued certain products which were originally acquired through business acquisitions additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

as of april 27 2012 we had 55 billion in cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in corporate bonds money market funds and us treasury securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis the downgrade in the us’s credit rating and bankruptcy filings in the us which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues the fair value of these financial investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets any investment securities that we hold or the issues comprising such securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates currently we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

in addition we hold investments in auction rate securities arss with a par value of 556 million which are securities with longterm nominal maturities all of our arss are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high 

  

based on this guarantee however liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for our ars investments for each failed auction the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continues to pay interest in accordance with its terms although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop or the final maturity of the individual securities 

as of april 27 2012 we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 45 million of which we recorded cumulative net temporary impairment charges of 31 million and 14 million of an otherthantemporary impairment charge we have classified all of our arss as other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of april 27 2012 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain although we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity if current market conditions deteriorate or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 

on occasion we make strategic investments in other companies which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control 

in the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some or all of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay 

beyond our open credit arrangements some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default 

we offer arrangements whereby the enduser customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable amount based on actual storage capacity used these arrangements subject us to additional risk with respect to revenue recognition and profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the variable portion of the arrangements in addition from time to time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by enduser customers 

we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit provided lease financing arrangements or guaranteed lease payments under full recourse lease arrangements such events have caused us to incur bad debt charges in the case of financing arrangements have caused a loss of revenues and in the case of recourse lease arrangements have caused us to make payments to third party financers we 

  

may be subject to similar losses in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents are held overseas if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and to service our debt and synthetic leases we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 

as of april 27 2012 27 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in foreign countries these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the us without triggering significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreign sources of liquidity and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities develop new products respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

our synthetic leases are offbalance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure which will increase our fixed costs our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 

we have various synthetic leasing arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor bnpplc for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale california these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment 

our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs our operating results will be harmed if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc if the fair value of the properties declines below their cost our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc up to the residual guarantee as of april 27 2012 the estimated fair value of certain properties was approximately 54 million below the cost of the properties for which we have accrued 49 million as of april 27 2012 any further decline in the fair value of the properties could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic lease arrangements the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 

our ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts or repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements if we lose access to the synthetic lease arrangements we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms which could limit our operating flexibility 

  

changes in market conditions have led and in the future could lead to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 

in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands we may decide to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring disposing of or otherwise discontinuing certain products any decision to limit investment in dispose of or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings including inventory and technologyrelated or other intangible asset writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products which would harm our operating results our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings which could materially harm our operating results 

we may need to undertake costreduction initiatives and restructuring initiatives in the future 

we have previously recognized restructuring and other charges related to initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our business in response to economic and market conditions including those announced in february 2009 and december 2008 we may undertake future costreduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves our reputation and the key aspects of our corporate culture our business and operating results could be harmed 

due to recent organic growth and acquisitions we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources our headcount has grown from approximately 10200 employees as of april 29 2011 to approximately 12100 employees as of april 27 2012 we will incur significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to assimilate our additional human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and enables us to maintain our reputation in the marketplace if we do not effectively manage our growth and train retain and manage our employee base our corporate culture could be undermined the quality of our products and customer service could suffer and our reputation could be harmed each of which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition as our headcount increases our costs will also increase our business will be harmed if our efforts to expand our organization and headcount are not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues 

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including moving activities from highercost to lowercost owned locations outsourcing certain business process functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide for example certain engineering activities and projects that were formerly performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations and we rely on partners or thirdparty service providers for the provision of certain customer support and service business process functions and activities in it human resources and accounting 

  

the challenges involved with moving or outsourcing activities include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures we are also subject to increased business continuity risks as we increase our reliance on outsource providers for example we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes including the management and internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or thirdparty service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business services as anticipated we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally which could be costly and timeconsuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of our business process improvement initiatives 

we are currently implementing changes to our business information systems and processes and other it initiatives these initiatives involve a large investment of capital and resources and significant changes to our current operating processes failure to properly implement one or more of these initiatives or an interruption in service or unavailability of our systems could result in lost business and increased costs which could negatively impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform legislation 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for workers’ compensation coverage and health care plans we record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the number and costs of expected claims administrative costs and stoploss premiums these estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stoploss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely impact our financial condition 

in march 2010 comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act hr 3590 and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act hr 4872 was passed and signed into law among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years the department of health and human services the national association of insurance commissioners the department of labor and the treasury department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation 

due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phasedin nature of the implementation it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years other possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation include reduced revenues increases in costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business if any of these adverse effects occur our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new 

  

products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees particularly our engineers salespeople and key managers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

a component of our strategy to hire and retain personnel consists of longterm compensation in the form of equitybased grants we face increased risk of the inability to continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval in light of increased shareholder activism heightened focus on corporate compensation practices and increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such equity compensation programs such inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract and retain employees 

in addition because of the structure of our incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees and other service providers at certain points in time for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of bonuses or the vesting of equity awards or other equity compensation as a result employees may be more likely to leave us during periods following such payments or the vesting of such awards the loss of services of a significant number of our key employees during a short period of time could be disruptive to our product development and sales efforts and adversely impact our business relationships and operating results 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes earthquakes volcanoes power loss power shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions or impair our ability to meet our customer demands our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may be a party to lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of our business from time to time including intellectual property commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions with employees resellers strategic partners and customers and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the 

  

pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products and climate change issues and environmental disclosures 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and safety regulations governing materials usage packaging climate control and other environmental impacts in the various countries in which we do business for example various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time failure to comply with such laws and regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions 

recently governmental and nongovernmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements to reduce carbon emissions while we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our products there is a risk that the development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it industry or will favor certain technological approaches depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted the cost of compliance could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we are subject to provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure and accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies 

  

whose securities are publicly traded for example in july 2010 the president signed into law the doddfrank act because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

if a data center or other thirdparty who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption or loss could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 

thirdparty vendors including data centers software as a service saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs we exercise little control over how these thirdparty vendors use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites 

security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we obtain and store sensitive data related to our employees customers and partners including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our employees customers and partners to be secure if our security measures are breached as a result of technical problems thirdparty actions employee error or malfeasance our reputation could be damaged and our business could suffer 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as the changes to revenue recognition standards that we recently adopted the increased use of fair value measures additional proposed changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our results of operations

critical accounting estimates and policies 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

we believe that the following accounting policies are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

we believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

revenue recognition reserves and allowances 

revenue recognition  — we recognize revenue when 

 

   

  

  

 our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered elements sem and premium hardware maintenance our sem entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues from sem and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from one to five years we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we also sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance concurrently the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to 

 

  

  

 we adopted these standards in fiscal 2011 for new and materially modified revenue arrangements originating after april 30 2010 

the majority of our products are hardware systems containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product therefore our hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems are considered nonsoftware deliverables and therefore are not subject to industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of nonessential software products nonessential software products may operate on our hardware systems but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware nonessential software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software nonessential 

  

software sales continue to be subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance for arrangements within the scope of the guidance a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer i has a general right of return relative to the delivered item and ii delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control both of the separation criteria must be met in order for a delivered item to be accounted for as a separate unit 

for transactions entered into or materially modified after april 30 2010 we recognize revenue in accordance with the current accounting standards when applicable certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance along with nonsoftware deliverables that are subject to the standards the revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy set forth in the standards 

for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables for our nonsoftware deliverables we use besp as our selling price for our software entitlements and support services we generally use vsoe as our selling price when we are unable to establish selling prices using vsoe for our software entitlements and support services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 

vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range in addition we consider major service type customer classifications and other variables in determining vsoe 

when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to determine tpe for our products or services 

when we are unable to establish the selling price of our nonsoftware deliverables using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is determined for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives historical pricing practices customer classes and distribution channels in determining besp we require that the majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable pricing range generally evidenced by a majority of such historical transactions falling within a reasonable range 

we regularly review vsoe tpe and besp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 

for sales of software deliverables after april 30 2010 and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance under the software revenue recognition guidance we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists in the majority of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is sem andor service under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenues if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is generally deferred 

  

until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established in instances where the only undelivered element without fair value is sem the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we use our best estimates in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold historically our inventory valuation adjustments have been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods 

in the normal course of business we make commitments to our thirdparty contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products we establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations to the extent that such forecasts are not achieved our commitments and associated accruals may change 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations which may require us to incur higher costs and adversely impact our operating results 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly acquired intangible assets which typically comprise developed technology trademarks and trade names customer contractsrelationships and covenants not to compete 

  

the valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business if different assumptions are used it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite inprocess research and development is capitalized at fair value and classified as an indefinitelived asset until completion or abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s assessment material impairments of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or an impairment in future periods as such any future impairments of these assets would adversely affect our operating results 

we perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management estimates and judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant impairments of goodwill may be required which would adversely affect our operating results in fiscal 2012 we performed such evaluation and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore found no impairment of goodwill 

product warranties 

estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues when the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific project failures that are outside our typical experience factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units subject to warranty protections product failure rates estimated material costs estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect our results of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation using the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each award grant on the date of grant our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected term of awards and the expected stock price volatility of the stock underlying such awards in addition we estimate the number of stockbased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover based on historical experience any changes in these highly subjective estimates and assumptions may significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

  

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

fair value measurements and impairments of marketable securities 

all of our availableforsale investments are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact our net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized we actively review current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary 

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below its carrying value the extent to which fair value is below cost and our ability and intent to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices liquidation values or other metrics for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our availableforsale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in a decline in the estimated fair value of our investments we monitor our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for otherthantemporary impairment charges 

we hold investments in auction rate securities ars which we classify as longterm investments as we believe our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain the valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ars included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security expected cash flows discount rates trading activity in the secondary market for similar securities credit ratings workout periods and overall capital market liquidity these assumptions assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties are difficult to predict and require significant judgment the use of different assumptions or applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value the fair value of our ars could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio we actively monitor the fair value of our ars and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or otherthantemporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges 

  

income taxes 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the united states and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures 

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns based on a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in applicable tax law settlement of issues under audit and new exposures if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 

new accounting standards 

see note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 discussion and analysis of results of operations for the three years ended april 27 2012 

overview  — net revenues for fiscal 2012 were 62332 million up 11106 million or 22 from fiscal 2011 the revenue growth was primarily due to 6566 million of eseries oem revenues continued demand for our storage efficiency and data management solutions and an increase in hardware maintenance contract revenues net revenues for fiscal 2011 were 51226 million up 11912 million or 30 from fiscal 2010 the revenue growth in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to strong demand for our storage efficiency and data management solutions including new products launched in november 2010 additionally net revenues for fiscal 2011 include a favorable impact of 1292 million or 3 of fiscal 2011 revenues from the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognition 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of lower gross margin eseries oem products in the revenue mix and the impact of higher discounting these decreases were partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher product and service revenues at improved margins 

sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 totaled 29571 million up 18 from fiscal 2011 these increases were primarily due to a 26 increase in average headcount in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the may 2011 acquisition of engenio represented approximately 10 of the average headcount for fiscal 2012 sales and marketing research and development and 

  

general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 totaled 24969 million up 21 from fiscal 2010 this increase is primarily due to a 17 increase in average headcount in fiscal 2011 and higher levels of incentive compensation and commission expense due to higher revenues and operating profits salary and related expenses during fiscal 2011 were favorably impacted by having 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 

net revenues  — net revenues were as follows in millions except percentages 

 

 net revenues increased by 11106 million or 22 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues which comprised 68 of net revenues in fiscal 2012 compared to 66 of net revenues in fiscal 2011 

net revenues increased by 11912 million or 30 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues which comprised 66 of net revenues in fiscal 2011 compared to 61 of net revenues in fiscal 2010 additionally net revenues in fiscal 2011 include a favorable impact of 1292 million or 3 from the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognition 

sales through our indirect channels represented 78 73 and 69 of net revenues in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the following customers each of which is a distributor accounted for 10 or more of net revenues in millions except percentages

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 27 2012 

liquidity sources and cash requirements 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 27 2012 consisted of approximately 54 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash we expect to generate from operations 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist of the following in millions 

 

 as of april 27 2012 27 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the united states while 27 billion were held in foreign countries most of the amounts held outside the united states can be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal and state income taxes if we were to repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the us and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies and service our debt and synthetic leases our contractual obligations as of april 27 2012 are summarized below in the contractual obligations table 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies and conversions of our notes by holders based on our current business outlook we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases contractual obligations commitments interest payments on our notes and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

our investment portfolio including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and 

  

market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other potential sources of cash we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions or other cash requirements we intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers if current market conditions deteriorate we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties our gross exposures to our investments in greece italy portugal and spain are individually and collectively not material 

capital expenditure requirements 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california research triangle park north carolina and other locations worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed our capital expenditures were 4071 million during fiscal 2012 we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be between 2500 million and 3000 million 

cash flows 

as of april 27 2012 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments increased by 2089 million from april 29 2011 to 55 billion the increase was primarily a result of 15 billion of cash provided by operating activities and 1421 million from issuances of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and purchases under the espp partially offset by 6000 million in cash paid for the repurchase of common stock 4800 million net cash paid in connection with the acquisition of engenio and 4071 million in capital expenditures we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our operating cash flows and from working capital accounts receivable days sales outstanding as of april 27 2012 decreased to 44 days compared to 47 days as of april 29 2011 primarily due to higher collections working capital increased by 3143 million to 33 billion as of april 27 2012 primarily due to a net increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2238 million and accounts receivable of 883 million and a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits of 969 million partially offset by an increase in shortterm deferred revenue of 1399 million 

cash flows from operating activities 

during fiscal 2012 and 2011 we generated cash from operating activities of 15 billion and 13 billion respectively the primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2012 consisted of net income of 6054 million adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 2931 million stockbased compensation of 2576 million and deferred income taxes of 609 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2012 included an increase in deferred revenue of 5064 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 904 million the primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2011 consisted of net income of 6731 million adjusted by stockbased compensation of 1752 million and depreciation and amortization of 1656 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2011 included an increase in accounts receivable of 2627 million an increase in deferred revenue of 3829 million and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of 1188 million 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections 

  

performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

during fiscal 2012 we completed our acquisition of engenio for a total net cash payment of 4800 million paid 14 billion net for investments and purchased 4071 million of capital expenditures including 443 million of buildings and land associated with the buyout of one of our synthetic leases during fiscal 2011 we purchased 2227 million of capital expenditures paid 4185 million net for investments and made net cash payments of 1365 million for acquisitions 

cash flows from financing activities 

during fiscal 2012 we used 3436 million in financing activities which primarily consisted of 6000 million for the repurchase of common stock partially offset by 1133 million of excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation and 1421 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans net of shares withheld for taxes during fiscal 2011 we generated 4509 million from financing activities which primarily consisted of 3242 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans net of shares withheld for taxes and 1277 million of excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee equity award programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees exercise stock options generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits will vary 

stock repurchase program 

since the may 13 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through april 27 2012 we have repurchased a total of 1190 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2965 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 35 billion as of april 27 2012 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 40 billion of our common stock under this stock repurchase program as of april 27 2012 the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 05 billion with no termination date the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

convertible notes 

as of april 27 2012 we had 1265 billion principal amount of 175 convertible senior notes due 2013 see note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements the notes will mature on june 1 2013 unless earlier repurchased or converted our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold for the notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2012 accordingly as of april 27 2012 the notes were convertible at the option of the holder and therefore the carrying value of the notes was classified as shortterm debt since the notes were convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount would have been required to be paid in cash the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the notes was reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our consolidated balance sheet as of april 27 2012 

  

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 27 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 

 

  

     some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions including the commitment duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table we expect to fund our contractual obligations and other commitments in the table above through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations or obtain additional financing if necessary 

  

as of april 27 2012 we have three leasing arrangements with bnpplc one of which require us to lease certain of our land to bnpplc for a period of 99 years and all of which require us to lease approximately 03 million square feet of office space from bnpplc for our headquarters in sunnyvale california which had an original cost of 696 million under these leasing arrangements we pay bnpplc minimum lease payments which vary based on a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates we make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years we have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc upon expiration or upon any earlier termination of the lease terms we must elect one of the following options i purchase the buildings from bnpplc at cost ii if certain conditions are met arrange for the sale of the buildings by bnpplc to a thirdparty and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the thirdparty and bnpplc’s cost up to 85 of cost residual guarantee or iii pay bnpplc supplemental payments for an amount equal to the difference between bnpplc’s cost and fair value up to the residual guarantee in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by bnpplc during the ensuing twoyear period the following table summarizes the aggregate cost the aggregate residual guarantee the applicable fixed rates at april 27 2012 and the lease commencement dates for our leasing arrangements 

 

 these leasing arrangements require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of april 27 2012 such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of less than 31 and a minimum amount of unencumbered cash and shortterm investments of 3000 million our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option would give bnpplc the right to among other things i terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements or ii exercise certain foreclosure remedies 

in april 2012 we exercised our option under one of our synthetic leasing arrangements to early terminate the lease and purchase the facilities including land and buildings for 800 million the early termination did not result in a material impact to our operating results 

based on a recent announcement by bnpplc that it intends to phase out of its synthetic lease activities we expect to exercise our option to buy out our synthetic leases when their five year terms expire in december 2012 through january 2013 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business see further details on such matters in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements

during the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 27 2012 our financial guarantees of 131 million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds which were primarily related to selfinsurance

currency the program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes currently we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below 

 

  

 as of april 27 2012 the notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 6418 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because of the short term maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid see note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to our hedging activities 

in the ordinary course of business some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing companies in the event of enduser customer default where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases we defer revenues in accordance with revenue recognition policies as of april 27 2012 the maximum guaranteed payment contingencies under our financing arrangements totaled approximately 1690 million and the related deferred revenue totaled approximately 1499 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

market risk and market interest risk 

investment and interest income  — as of april 27 2012 we had debt investments of 39 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and are classified as availableforsale investments these investments which consist primarily of corporate bonds commercial paper and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels as of april 27 2012 would cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of these availableforsale investments volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings companyspecific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any otherthantemporary impairment charges 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 27 2012 we recorded cumulative unrealized losses of 40 million offset by 09 million of cumulative unrealized gains related to these securities the fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the market’s perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

if current market conditions deteriorate or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss or otherthantemporary impairment charges to earnings in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures or other operating requirements 

convertible notes  — in june 2008 we issued 1265 billion principal amount of 175 notes due 2013 of which 10170 million was allocated to debt and 2480 million was allocated to equity holders may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to 

 

  

  

   

the notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount if any at an initial conversion rate of 3140 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents an initial effective conversion price of the notes of 3185 per share subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the notes 

concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock in fiscal 2010 we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to 20 of our note hedges and because we have decided not to replace the hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the 20 unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 

our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold for the notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2012 accordingly as of april 27 2012 the notes were convertible at the option of the holder and therefore the carrying value of the notes was classified as shortterm debt since the notes were convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount would have been required to be paid in cash the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the notes was reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our consolidated balance sheets as of april 27 2012 

upon conversion of any notes we deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock as of april 27 2012 shares issued related to the notes were minimal based on the closing price of our common stock of 3903 on april 27 2012 the ifconverted value of our notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately 2853 million 

the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of the notes for disclosure purposes as of april 27 2012 the principal amount of the notes which consists of the combined debt and equity components was 1265 billion and the total estimated fair value of the principal amount was 1650 billion based on the closing trading price of 130 per 100 of the notes as of that date 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings each period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions these derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 27 2012 the timevalue component is recorded in earnings while all other unrealized gains or losses are included in other comprehensive income 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

seasonality 

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

backlog 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short lead times and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue 

manufacturing and supply chain

we were awarded iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be iso 9001 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004 and continue to be iso 14001 certified 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 research and development expenses represented 13 14 and 15 of our net revenues respectively these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

competition 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services in the primary storage market our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data management software from dell emc hitachi data systems 

  

hp ibm and oracle corporation in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup archival and compliance and business continuity segments our solutions mainly compete against products from emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation in vertical markets — such as content storage digital media and graphics — our top competitors include emc hitachi data systems and hp in the it infrastructure and service provider markets we compete primarily with emc hitachi data systems and hp 

we compete with these companies based on market presence breadth of product offerings breadth of service offerings and price some of these companies also compete by offering storage and data management products or services together with other it products or services at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 

we believe that we have a number of competitive advantages over many of these companies including product innovation the relationships we have with our customers the deep integration we do with technology partners and our collaboration with sales partners we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance flexibility quality and operational efficiency we believe our advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and sales partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase from us or from one of our sales partners 

an increase in industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

proprietary rights 

we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our netapp name and logo network appliance tm name and logo data ontap datafabric ®  faserver ®  flexvol filerview ®  nearstore ®  secureshare ®  snapdrive ®  snaplock snapmanager ®  snapmirror snaprestore snapvault wafl and others as trademarks in the united states other us trademarks and us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees might depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights and we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see item 1 business — forward looking statements of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of the forwardlooking statements that are qualified by these risk factors if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain economic and market conditions 

we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide or in certain geographic regions have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology it market resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 any of the abovementioned factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations during times of economic volatility these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 due to such factors operating results for future periods are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast and a shortfall in revenues may harm our business and our operating results 

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast especially in times of economic uncertainty because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and we rely increasingly on sales through our indirect channel partners including valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners new product introductions and the transition from old to new products also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 

in addition we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets our financial results will be adversely impacted additionally due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast bookings and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment and also because customers’ purchasing decisions are subject to delay reduction or cancellation small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in addition the risks inherent in using a “pipeline” system are magnified with respect to indirect sales made through our channel partners because we have less control over and visibility into the sales process of our channel partners 

economic uncertainties have caused and may in the future again cause consumers businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets credit decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence accordingly future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

  

we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 

changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a challenging operating environment for our business it is critical that we maintain appropriate alignment between our cost structure and our expected growth and revenues while at the same time continuing to make strategic investments for future growth 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

conversely if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products we could also experience an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition and our customer relationships may be adversely impacted if the storage and data management market fails to grow or grows slower than we expect our revenues will be adversely affected also even if spending in the it market increases our revenues may not grow at the same pace 

our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary and such variation makes it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of our product software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues 

our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

  

 changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 due to such factors gross margins are subject to variation from period to period and are difficult to predict 

an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc including its recent acquisition of isilon hitachi data systems hp ibm dell and oracle corporation in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and oracle corporation 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers as solesource vendors in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales 

if we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our channel partners or if our channel partners fail to effectively manage the sale of our products or services on our behalf our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

we market and sell our storage data management solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect channels during fiscal 2011 revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel distribution accounted for 73 of our revenues and we expect this percentage to continue to increase over time as we further develop these channels or acquire products distributed through indirect channels in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 

  

several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our indirect channel distribution model which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins including the following 

 

  

  

  

 there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new indirect channel partners retain these indirect channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement indirect channel partners in the future especially in light of changes in end customer demand patterns and changes in available and competing technologies from competitors the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met our inability to effectively establish train retain and manage our indirect channel partners could harm our sales 

in addition we depend on our indirect channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our oem relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenues 

in april 2005 we entered into an oem agreement with ibm which enables ibm to sell ibmbranded solutions based on our unified solutions including nearstore ® and vseries systems as well as associated software offerings in addition by acquiring esg we have assumed lsi’s rights under a second oem agreement with ibm which enables ibm to sell certain esg solutions while these agreements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm under either oem agreement and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore our relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenues or in the case of the oem agreement related to esg may not allow us to capture certain anticipated benefits of the esg acquisition in addition we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell or its release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control its pricing 

in the event that sales through our oem relationship with ibm increase which we expect will occur as a result of the esg transaction we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oem or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts or if our oem relationship does not continue to generate significant revenues our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 

during fiscal 2011 sales to distributors arrow electronics inc and avnet inc accounted for approximately 18 and 12 respectively of our net revenues we also have significant oem agreements with ibm which as described above enable ibm to sell ibmbranded solutions based on our solutions as well as an agreement with fujitsu technology solutions fujitsu which enables fujitsu to lease sell market and resell our 

  

products to end users and fujitsu sales partners worldwide to integrate our products into fujitsu bundled offerings and to market our support services the loss of orders from these or any of our more significant customers strategic partners distributors or resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer 

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 

unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if the uncertainty in the economy continues or conditions deteriorate and our sales decline our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to or unexpected returns from customers and resellers or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business we expect that our largest customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today end users could stop purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing our products at any time the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter could harm our operating results in addition a change in the pricing practices of one or more of our large indirect channel partners could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us future revenues from the us government are subject to shifts in government spending patterns a decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues in addition our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the us government 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage and data management market generally and for us in particular however government demand is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

in addition selling our products to the us government whether directly or indirectly also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements for example in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice doj and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of gsa contracts for certain specified prior years failure to comply with us government regulatory requirements by us or our reseller partners could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results and financial position 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenues may be impacted negatively 

an element of our strategy to increase revenues is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with them we have significant partner relationships with database business application backup management and server virtualization companies including microsoft oracle sap symantec and vmware in january 2010 we announced an expansion of our collaboration with cisco and vmware including a cooperative support arrangement and in october 2010 we expanded our relationship with fujitsu technology solutions a number 

  

of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners these partnerships may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time if these relationships are not maintained or fail to materialize as expected we could experience lower than expected revenue growth suffer delays in product development or experience other operational difficulties 

in addition some of our partners including oracle cisco and vmware are also partnering with other storage vendors which may increase the availability of competing solutions harm our ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data management solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships our future revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if the performance of these markets does not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets the markets for storage and data management have been recently adversely impacted by the global economic uncertainty and as a result of continued uncertainty the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline 

additionally emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components utilized in the assembly of our products which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity in addition pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into with lsi in connection with the acquisition of certain assets related to esg we have the right to place orders with contract manufacturers and suppliers through lsi and access lsi’s systems in order to help us manage the esg business for a period of time following the acquisition financial problems of either contract manufacturers component suppliers or other parties in our supply chain including lsi and reservation 

  

of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs of our products qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and timeconsuming and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity with respect to any contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately procure inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to timely cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease as the demand for our products has increased we have experienced and may continue to experience tightening of supply of some components leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints which has resulted in and in the future could continue to result in the delay of shipments 

our business operations are subject to business interruptions and other events beyond our control such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 

our acquisitions may disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities in fiscal year 2011 we completed acquisitions of two technology companies and on may 6 2011 we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to esg the acquisition and ongoing integration of new businesses into our business may adversely affect our operations or profitability we may not achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies or realize our estimated revenue gross margin profit or other financial projections or business objectives in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets for example we have in the past discontinued certain products which were originally acquired through business acquisitions additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay 

beyond our open credit arrangements we also have recourse and nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements using thirdparty leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are treated as offbalance sheet arrangements we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing company in the event of enduser customer default 

we also offer financing arrangements whereby the enduser customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable amount based on actual storage capacity used these arrangements subject us to additional risk with respect to revenue recognition and profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the variable portion of the arrangements in addition from time to time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by enduser customers 

we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit or provided lease financing arrangements causing us to incur bad debt charges and in the case of financing arrangements a loss of revenues we may be subject to similar losses in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

  

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause substantial fluctuation in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on it could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 

changes in market conditions have led and in the future could lead to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 

in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands we may decide to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring disposing of or otherwise discontinuing certain products any decision to limit investment in dispose of or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings including inventory and technologyrelated or other intangible asset writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products which would harm our operating results our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings which could materially harm our operating results 

  

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance if we fail to manage the interoperability and transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues and subject us to additional financial and operational risks if they are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must attempt to successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

due to the global nature of our business risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although a substantial portion of our business is located and conducted in the united states a significant portion of our operations are located and a significant portion of our revenues are derived outside of the united states during fiscal 2011 our international revenues accounted for 49 of our total revenues a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts in addition we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets conversely lowering our price in local currency may result in lower usbased revenues a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses in foreign markets additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can experience extreme volatility we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter the timevalue component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have a 

  

negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include inaccuracies in forecasting widening interest rate differentials and volatility in the foreign exchange market our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 

in addition due to the global nature of our business we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products including antitrust and anticompetition laws rules and regulations general importexport restrictions and regulations related to data privacy for example united states government export restrictions impede our ability to sell our products to certain end users the united states through the bureau of industry security places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology these restrictions may include the requirement to have a license to export the technology the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country our products are subject to various levels of export restrictions these export restrictions could negatively impact our business we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with these policies procedures laws andor regulations any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for united states federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the obama administration and congress have announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings should such antideferral provisions be enacted our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement in recent years several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which has resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies 

during fiscal year 2009 we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax returns we filed a protest with the irs in response to the notices of proposed adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from the irs examination team in response to our protest in april 2011 we executed a closing agreement with the irs appeals office to close this examination the notices of proposed adjustments in this audit focused primarily on issues relating to the timing and the amount of income recognized deductions taken and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years the settlement of our 20032004 irs examination resulted in additional liability of 108 million which is almost entirely offset by net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the examination settlement we have reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions and recognized a net benefit of 211 million 

during fiscal year 2010 the irs commenced the examination of our fiscal 2005 through 2007 federal income tax returns and in addition the california franchise tax board began the examination of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 california income tax returns these audits are currently in progress 

on september 17 2010 the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from the company’s danish subsidiary for which the company has not paid or accrued any taxes are subject to danish atsource dividend withholding tax the company has appealed this assessment decision with the danish national tax tribunal 

if the ultimate determination of income taxes or atsource withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april 30 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

  

our leverage and debt service obligations and note conversion may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our notes we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past in addition we have various synthetic lease arrangements related to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale california and subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financing agreements we may incur additional debt our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability to us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds or we may be required to raise additional funds through other means if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

any conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price initially 3185 per share the notes will cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2011 our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 4141 per share set forth for these notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holder’s option through june 30 2011 based on the trading price of our common stock on april 29 2011 we had approximately 16 million shares of common stock potentially issuable on conversion of our notes upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders 

the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with these hedging transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions 

  

from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our shareholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in april 2010 we terminated our note hedge transaction with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc lehman otc which was a counterparty to 20 of our note hedges as a result of the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc which constituted an event of default under the note hedge because we have decided not to replace this note hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 the terms of the notes the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination of this note hedge 

the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the notes and warrants 

future issuances of common stock related to our notes warrants stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the notes 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 30 2011 our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 4141 per share set forth for these notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holder’s option through june 30 2011 upon conversion of any notes we will satisfy our obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the notes and shares of common stock if any to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount any new issuance of equity securities including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our note hedges could dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

as of april 29 2011 eligible individuals under our stock option and restricted stock unit plans held options to purchase approximately 25 million shares of our common stock and a total of approximately 10 million restricted stock units respectively if all the outstanding options were exercised the proceeds to the company would average approximately 27 per share we also had 14 million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to equity awards that have not been granted the exercise of all of the outstanding options andor the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan espp under which employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a twoyear period as of april 29 2011 we had approximately 4 million shares of our common stock available for issuance under the espp the issuance of shares under the espp would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons including to finance our operations related to business strategy including in connection with acquisitions strategic alliances or other transactions to increase our capital to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options upon conversion of the notes or for other reasons 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

at april 29 2011 we had 52 billion in cash cash equivalents availableforsale securities and restricted cash and investments we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in us treasury securities commercial paper us government agency bonds corporate bonds certificates of deposit and money market funds these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis and bankruptcy filings in the united states which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues these securities are generally classified as “availableforsale” and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates currently we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets any investment securities that we hold or the issues comprising such securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

on occasion we make strategic investments in other companies including private equity funds which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control as of april 29 2011 we had an investment with the carrying value of 13 million in a private equity fund 

in the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some or all of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 

a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and to service our debt we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 

a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may 

  

need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities develop new products respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

our synthetic leases are offbalance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure which will increase our fixed costs our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 

we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor bnpplc for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale california these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for leases and are not considered variable interest entities under applicable accounting guidance therefore we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs our operating results will be harmed if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc as of april 29 2011 the estimated fair value of the properties was approximately 358 million below the guaranteed minimum residual value which we are accruing over the remaining term of the respective leases any further decline in the fair value of the properties could adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and operating results 

as a result of excess capacity in our sunnyvale facilities certain of our facilities subject to synthetic lease arrangements have been subleased or are vacant these subleases will expire at various times through 2015 and some are at terms that do not generate sufficient sublease income to cover the carrying costs of these facilities in addition we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities under operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic lease arrangements the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 

our ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts or repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements if we lose access to the synthetic lease arrangements we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms which could limit our operating flexibility 

the agreements governing our synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these restrictive covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted we may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 

our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our synthetic lease arrangements which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangements in addition our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the notes which could permit the holders to accelerate the notes if all of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 

we have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties 

in order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk should there be a counterparty default we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 

funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for more than 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience further otherthantemporary declines in value which would adversely affect our earnings 

auction rate securities arss held by us are securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase interest rates for ars are reset through a “dutch auction” each month which prior to february 2008 had provided a liquid market for these securities 

all of our arss are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee however liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments with a par value of 713 million for each failed auction the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continues to pay interest in accordance with its terms although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop or the final maturity of the individual securities 

as of april 29 2011 we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 62 million of which we have recorded cumulative net temporary impairment charges of 41 million and 21 million was recognized as an otherthantemporary impairment charge in addition we have classified all of our auction rate securities as longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets at april 29 2011 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain although we currently have the 

  

ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity if current market conditions deteriorate or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers 

we may need to undertake costreduction initiatives and restructuring initiatives in the future 

we have previously recognized restructuring charges related to initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our business in response to economic and market conditions including those announced in february 2009 and december 2008 we may undertake future costreduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves our reputation and the key aspects of our corporate culture our business and operating results could be harmed 

due to recent organic growth and acquisitions we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources our headcount has grown from approximately 8300 employees on april 30 2010 to over 11000 employees following the esg acquisition in may 2011 we will incur significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to assimilate our additional human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and enables us to maintain our reputation in the marketplace if we do not effectively manage our growth and train retain and manage our employee base our corporate culture could be undermined the quality of our products and customer service could suffer and our reputation could be harmed each of which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition as our headcount increases our costs will also increase our business will be harmed if our efforts to expand our organization and headcount are not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues 

if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement all or a portion of the revenues relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods 

in the course of our sales efforts we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include software related elements consisting of nonessential software and undelivered software entitlements and maintenance if we are required to change the pricing of our softwarerelated elements through discounting or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements we may be unable to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement a delay in the recognition of revenues may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure business processes and systems more efficient including moving activities from highercost to lowercost owned locations outsourcing certain business process functions and implementing new business information systems problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide for example certain engineering activities and projects that were formerly performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations and we rely on partners or thirdparty service providers for the provision of certain business process functions and activities in it human resources and accounting 

  

the challenges involved with moving or outsourcing activities include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures we are also subject to increased business continuity risks as we increase our reliance on outsource providers for example we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes including the management and internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business services as anticipated we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally which could be costly and timeconsuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of our business process improvement initiatives 

we are currently implementing changes to our business information systems and processes and other it initiatives these initiatives involve a large investment of capital and resources and significant changes to our current operating processes failure to properly implement one or more of these initiatives or an interruption in service or unavailability of our systems could result in lost business and increased costs which could negatively impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform legislation 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for workers’ compensation coverage and health care plans we record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the number and costs of expected claims administrative costs and stoploss premiums these estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stoploss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely impact our financial condition 

in march 2010 comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act hr 3590 and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act hr 4872 was passed and signed into law among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years the department of health and human services the national association of insurance commissioners the department of labor and the treasury department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation 

due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phasedin nature of the implementation it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation include reduced revenues increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified employees 

  

particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees particularly our engineers salespeople and key managers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

a component of our strategy to hire and retain personnel consists of longterm compensation in the form of equitybased grants we face increased risk of the inability to continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval in light of increased shareholder activism heightened focus on corporate compensation practices and increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such equity compensation programs such inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract and retain employees 

in addition because of the structure of our incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees and other service providers at certain points in time for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of bonuses or the vesting of stock options employee stock purchase rights or other equity compensation as a result employees may be more likely to leave us during periods following such payments or the vesting of such rights the loss of services of a significant number of our key employees during a short period of time could be disruptive to our product development and sales efforts and adversely impact our business relationships and operating results 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes earthquakes volcanoes power loss power shortages environmental disasters telecommunications or business information systems failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues gross margins and operating results 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

in addition if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and these occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues gross margins and operating results we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

  

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may be a party to lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of our business from time to time including intellectual property commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products and climate change issues 

we continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products as a result governmental and nongovernmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions there is a risk that the development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it 

  

industry or will favor certain technological approaches depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted compliance could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

climate change issues energy usage and emissions controls may result in new environmental legislation and regulations at any or all of the international federal and state levels that may unfavorably impact us our suppliers and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design development and manufacturing of our products this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a consequence of regulations or business trends such as 

 

  

  

 our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

we have completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april 29 2011 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 29 2011 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

on july 21 2010 the president signed into law the doddfrank act many aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us however as we continue to implement changes in response to this new law and its associated regulations we expect to incur additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

  

if a data center or other third party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data such disruption or loss could be attributed to the quality of our products thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 

thirdparty vendors including data centers saas cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs we exercise little control over how these thirdparty vendors use or maintain our products and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products a disruption in the services provided by these thirdparty vendors or the loss of data stored by such vendors could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by or perceived by our customers to have been caused by defects in our products moreover the risk of reputational harm may be magnified andor distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet including through news articles blogs chat rooms and social media sites 

security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we obtain and store sensitive data related to our employees customers and partners including intellectual property books of record and personally identifiable information it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our employees customers and partners to be secure if our security measures are breached as a result of technical problems thirdparty actions employee error or malfeasance our reputation could be damaged and our business could suffer 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as the changes to revenue recognition standards that we recently adopted the increased use of fair value measures additional proposed changes to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instruments and other accounting standards and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies particularly those related to revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue which may affect our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference 

overview 

revenues for fiscal 2011 were 51 billion up 12 billion or 30 from fiscal 2010 the improved revenue performance in fiscal 2011 was predominantly the result of strong demand for our storage efficiency and data management solutions including the new products launched in november 2010 additionally net revenues for fiscal 2011 include a favorable impact of 1292 million from the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognition revenues for fiscal 2010 were 39 billion up 05 billion or 15 from fiscal 2009 improved revenue performance in fiscal 2010 was the result of improvements in product software entitlements and maintenance sem and service revenues revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a 1287 million settlement with the general services administration gsa the dispute related to our discounting practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased during fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of higher product and service revenues at improved margins the gross profit margin percentage increased during fiscal 2010 due largely to reductions in product materials cost partially offset by a decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products as well as an increase in our sem and services revenues mix relative to product revenues in addition our gross profit margin percentage in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the gsa settlement 

operating expenses excluding restructuring and other charges and acquisition related income expense net for fiscal 2011 totaled 25 billion up 21 from fiscal 2010 the increase is primarily due to a 17 increase in average headcount in fiscal 2011 and higher levels of incentive compensation and commission expense due to higher revenues and operating profits salary and related expenses during fiscal 2011 were favorably impacted by having 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2010 operating expenses excluding restructuring and other charges and acquisition related income expense net totaled 21 billion up 10 from fiscal 2009 and reflected the impact of an increase in incentive compensation and commissions expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit performance as well as having 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009 

during fiscal 2010 we entered into a merger agreement with data domain inc which was subsequently terminated on july 8 2009 in accordance with the agreement we received a 570 million termination fee which when netted against 159 million of incremental thirdparty costs we incurred relating to the terminated merger transaction resulted in net proceeds of 411 million 

subsequent event 

on may 6 2011 we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities related to the engenio external storage systems business esg of lsi corporation lsi we paid lsi 480 million in cash and assumed certain assets and liabilities related to esg this acquisition will enable us to further expand our oem channel and address emerging and fastgrowing segments of the storage market such as video including fullmotion video capture and digital video surveillance as well as highperformance computing applications such as genomics sequencing and scientific research 

  

the transaction is expected to materially impact our results of operations in fiscal 2012 and beyond we expect fiscal 2012 esg product revenues to consist primarily of revenues from sales to their existing oems with new business developing slowly over the course of the year the fiscal 2012 consolidated product gross margin percentage is expected to decrease compared to fiscal 2011 reflecting the impact on our existing business of the lower gross margin esg oem revenues 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

we believe that the following accounting policies are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

we believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

revenue recognition reserves and allowances 

revenue recognition  — we recognize revenue when 

 

  

  

  

 our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered elements sem and premium hardware maintenance our sem entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues 

  

from sem and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from one to five years we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we also sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered 

in october 2009 the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance concurrently the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to 

 

  

  

 we elected to early adopt these standards in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and the standards were applied retrospectively from the beginning of fiscal 2011 for new and materially modified revenue arrangements originating after april 30 2010 

the majority of our products are hardware systems containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product therefore our hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems are considered nonsoftware deliverables and therefore are not subject to industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of nonessential software products nonessential software products may operate on our hardware systems but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware nonessential software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software nonessential software sales continue to be subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance for arrangements within the scope of the new guidance a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements 

for transactions entered into or materially modified after april 30 2010 we recognize revenue in accordance with the new accounting standards when applicable certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance along with nonsoftware deliverables that are subject to the new standards the revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy set forth in the new standards 

for our nonsoftware deliverables we recognize revenue based on the new standards and allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables for our nonsoftware deliverables we use besp as our selling price for our software entitlements and support services we generally use vsoe as our selling price when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe for our software entitlements and support services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 

  

vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range in addition we consider major service type customer classifications and other variables in determining vsoe 

when vsoe cannot be established the company attempts to establish selling price of each element based on tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore the company is typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 

when we are unable to establish selling price of our nonsoftware deliverables using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is determined for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives historical pricing practices customer classes and distribution channels in determining besp we require that the majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable pricing range generally evidenced by a majority of such historical transactions falling within a reasonable range 

we regularly review vsoe tpe and besp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 

for sales of software deliverables after april 30 2010 and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance under the software revenue recognition guidance we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists in the majority of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is sem andor service under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is generally deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established in instances where the only undelivered element without fair value is sem the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 

net revenues and net income for the year ended april 29 2011 were higher by 1292 million and 530 million respectively as a result of adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified sales transactions in any given period in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition we expect that these new accounting standards will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the related accounting this may lead us to engage in new gotomarket practices in the future in particular we expect that the amended accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services for which we have not established vsoe into existing offerings and solutions as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

  

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectability and adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 29 2011 was 05 million compared to 16 million as of april 30 2010 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold historically our inventory valuation adjustments have been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods 

in the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products we establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations to the extent that such forecasts are not achieved our commitments and associated accruals may change 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations which may require us to incur higher costs and adversely impact our operating results 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities particularly acquired intangible assets which typically comprise acquired technology trademarks and tradenames customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete 

the valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business if different assumptions are used it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation 

  

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite inprocess research and development is capitalized at fair value and classified as indefinitelived assets until completion or abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our operating results 

we perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required which would adversely affect our operating results in fiscal 2011 we performed such evaluation and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore found no impairment of goodwill 

restructuring reserves 

we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction intangibles and fixed assets writeoffs and noncancelable lease costs related to excess facilities severancerelated charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments we record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated the decision to eliminate excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises intangible asset writeoffs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of specific products fixed assets writeoffs primarily consist of equipment software and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future 

product warranties 

estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material distribution and labor costs our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued 

  

liabilities and other longterm obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units estimated material costs estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered necessary 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation using the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

fair value measurements and impairments 

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value and our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices liquidation values or other metrics for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 

the fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below 

 

  

   

 we measure our availableforsale securities at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale securities include us treasury securities us government agency bonds corporate bonds commercial paper arss money market funds and certificates of deposit where possible we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as level 1 in the hierarchy when quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable varying valuation techniques are used such assets are classified as level 2 or level 3 in the hierarchy we classify items in level 2 if investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency we classify items in level 3 if investments are valued using a pricing model based on unobservable inputs in the market or that require us to develop our own assumptions our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our availableforsale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments we monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges 

we actively review current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary as of april 29 2011 and april 30 2010 our shortterm and longterm investments in marketable securities have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value availableforsale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as shortterm investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements currently all marketable securities held by us are classified as availableforsale and our entire ars portfolio is classified as longterm investments 

our ars portfolio consists of securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at the time of purchase during fiscal 2008 we reclassified all of our investments in ars from shortterm investments to longterm investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments we recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of approximately 45 million and 33 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively partially offset by 04 million and 07 million respectively in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income loss during fiscal 2009 we recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of approximately 70 million partially offset by 03 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income loss in addition during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 21 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ars related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades 

the valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ars include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security expected cash flows discount rates credit ratings workout periods and overall capital market liquidity these assumptions assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties are difficult to predict and require significant judgment the use of different assumptions or applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value there is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize the fair value of our ars could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets if these uncertainties continue or if these 

  

securities experience credit rating downgrades we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio we will continue to monitor the fair value of our ars and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or otherthantemporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges 

as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers which occurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments during fiscal 2010 we sold our remaining holdings of lehman brothers bonds and the primary fund made multiple distributions of its assets to its investors and as of april 30 2010 we recovered our recorded investment with the exception of 02 million for which we recognized an additional loss as of april 30 2010 we no longer had any direct or indirect investments related to lehman brothers and have recognized all related losses in our statements of operations 

during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 recognized gains and losses on availableforsale investments were not material management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date the fair value of our marketable securities including those included in cash equivalents and longterm investments was 40436 million and 36192 million as of april 29 2011 and april 30 2010 respectively 

to determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments we use the most recent information available to us including new financings or estimates of current fair value as well as traditional valuation techniques it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are otherthantemporarily impaired in the case of privatelyheld companies this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies if we believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value and this difference is otherthantemporary it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value the carrying value of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 13 million and 14 million as of april 29 2011 and april 30 2010 respectively during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we recorded 01 million of net impairment charges and 34 million of realized gains in our consolidated statements of operations respectively for our investments in privatelyheld companies and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be otherthantemporary 

income taxes 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the united states and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures 

  

we have provided a valuation allowance of 455 million as of april 29 2011 compared to 283 million as of april 30 2010 and 280 million as of april 24 2009 on certain of our deferred tax assets the change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2011 was primarily related to the realizability of state credit carryforwards as a result of the expected application of the california single sales factor apportionment election the change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 was primarily related to changes in blended state tax rates the tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards are 4142 million as of april 29 2011 

we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns based on a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in applicable tax law settlement of issues under audit and new exposures if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 29 2011 

liquidity sources cash requirements 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 29 2011 consisted of approximately 52 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash we expect to generate from operations 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist of the following 

 

 as of april 29 2011 30 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the united states while 22 billion were held in foreign countries most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal and state income taxes as of april 29 2011 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 8721 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards however our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations our principal liquidity requirements are to fund the 480 million purchase price of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of certain assets related to esg meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities fund research and development meet capital expenditure needs invest in critical or complementary technologies and to service our debt and synthetic leases our contractual obligations as of april 29 2011 are summarized below in the contractual obligations tables 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories our ability to effectively integrate acquired products businesses and technologies including esg and conversions of our notes 

  

by holders based on our current business outlook we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases contractual obligations commitments interest payments on our notes and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

our investment portfolio including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other potential sources of cash we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions or other cash requirements we intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers if current market conditions deteriorate we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods 

capital expenditure requirements 

our capital expenditures were 2227 million during fiscal 2011 we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be between 2500 million and 3000 million we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities equipment operating leases and internaluse software development projects over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california research triangle park north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed

as of april 29 2011 compared to april 30 2010 our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments increased by 15 billion to 52 billion the increase was primarily a result of 13 billion of cash provided by operating activities and to a lesser extent from issuances of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan of 1965 million net of tax benefit partially offset by 749 million and 616 million net cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of bycast and akorri respectively and 2227 million in capital expenditures we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital accounts receivable days sales outstanding as of april 29 2011 increased to 47 days compared to 37 days as of april 30 2010 as material supply constraints through the middle of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 contributed to a backend loaded shipment profile which in turn drove the increase in days sales outstanding working capital increased by 3663 million to 30 billion as of april 29 2011 compared to 26 billion as of april 30 2010 primarily due 

  

to an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 15 billion partially offset by the reclassification of our 12 billion notes to current liabilities as the underlying contingent conversion threshold was exceeded at april 29 2011 

cash flows from operating activities 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we generated cash from operating activities of 13 billion and 9750 million respectively the primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2011 consisted of net income of 6731 million adjusted by noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1752 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 1656 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2011 included an increase in accounts receivable of 2627 million due to the backend loaded shipment profile during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 an increase in deferred revenue of 3829 million primarily resulting from overall growth in shipments and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of 1188 million due to our increase in headcount the primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of 4004 million adjusted by noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1598 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 1660 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of 1767 million and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of 532 million 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 were 2227 million we paid 4185 million for net purchases and redemptions of our investments in fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2011 we completed our acquisitions of bycast and akorri for total cash payments of 749 million and 616 million respectively net of cash acquired capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were 1356 million which included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in bangalore india for approximately 285 million we paid 8603 million for net purchases and redemptions of shortterm investments in fiscal 2010 

cash flows from financing activities 

we received 4509 million from financing activities in fiscal 2011 which primarily consisted of 3242 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans net of shares withheld for taxes and 1277 million of excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation we received 2199 million from financing activities in fiscal 2010 which primarily consisted of 1971 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans net of shares withheld for taxes and 142 million from the settlement of a note hedge with lehman brothers 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee equity award programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees exercise stock options or participate in our espp program generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits will vary 

stock repurchase program 

since the may 13 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through april 29 2011 our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40 billion of common stock under such stock repurchase program at april 29 2011 11 billion remains available under these authorizations the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

  

convertible notes 

as of april 29 2011 we had 1265 billion principal amount of 175 convertible senior notes due 2013 see note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements the notes will mature on june 1 2013 unless earlier repurchased or converted based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period in fiscal 2011 the contingent conversion threshold of the notes was exceeded as of april 29 2011 accordingly the carrying value of the notes was classified as a current liability at april 29 2011 since the notes are convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount is required to be paid in cash the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the notes is reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our balance sheet as of april 29 2011 the determination of whether or not the notes are convertible must continue to be performed on an ongoing basis consequently the notes may not be convertible in future quarters and therefore may again be classified as longterm debt if the contingent conversion threshold is not met in such quarters as of april 29 2011 shares issued related to conversion of the notes were minimal receipts of shares related to the note hedge transactions were minimal and there was no cash or shares delivered in relation to the warrant transactions as of april 29 2011 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 29 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 

 

 some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table we expect to fund our contractual obligations and other commitments in the table above through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations or obtain additional financing if necessary 

 

   

    as of april 29 2011 we have four leasing arrangements leasing arrangements 1 2 3 and 4 with bnpplc which require us to lease certain of our land to bnpplc for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 06 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale which had an original cost of 1496 million under these leasing arrangements we pay bnpplc minimum lease payments which vary based on libor plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates we make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years we have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc upon expiration or upon any earlier termination of the lease terms we must elect one of the following options i purchase the buildings from bnpplc at cost ii if certain conditions are met arrange for the sale of the buildings by bnpplc to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts or iii pay bnpplc supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by bnpplc during the ensuing twoyear period the following table summarizes the costs the residual guarantee the applicable libor plus spread or fixed rate at april 29 2011 and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements in millions 

 

 all leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of april 29 2011 such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of less than three to one and a minimum amount of unencumbered cash 

  

and shortterm investments of 300 million our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option would give bnpplc the right to among other things i terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements or ii exercise certain foreclosure remedies if we were to exercise our purchase option or be required to pay lease termination damages these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity which could constrain our operating flexibility 

as of april 29 2011 we estimated that the fair value of the properties under synthetic lease was 358 million less than their aggregate residual guarantees we are accruing for this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective leases as of april 29 2011 a deficiency reserve of 161 million was included in other longterm liabilities 

we may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our operating or other objectives 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may arise in the normal course of business no accrual has been recorded as of april 29 2011 as the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable 

on october 13 2010 amalgamated bank as trustee of the longview largecap 500 index fund and the longview largecap 500 index veba fund filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of netapp inc and netapp us public sector inc in the superior court of the state of california santa clara county the lawsuit named 15 of our current and former directors as defendants on february 3 2011 the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in response to motions to dismiss that we and the individual defendants had filed like the original complaint the amended complaint includes claims of breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and alleges that the defendants failed to monitor internal controls to ensure that we complied with legal requirements in our general services administration gsa contracting activities resulting in us incurring defense and settlement costs the amended complaint seeks disgorgement of salaries and other compensation from the defendants and additional unspecified damages we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in early march 2011 and the hearing on these motions is scheduled for july 15 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 29 2011 our financial guarantees of 53 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds which were primarily related to selfinsurance 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency the program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes currently we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below 

 

  

   

as of april 29 2011 our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 5924 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because of the short term maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid see note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to our hedging activities 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into recourse lease financing arrangements with thirdparty leasing companies and from time to time provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to the thirdparty funding companies in the event of nonpayment by enduser customers see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to these financing arrangements 

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance 

we have commitments related to four lease arrangements with bnpplc for approximately 06 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale california as further described above under “contractual obligations” our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of 1324 million as discussed above in “contractual obligations” 

we have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have determined the following 

 

  

 accordingly under current accounting guidance we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnpplc lease

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

market risk and market interest risk 

investment and interest income  — as of april 29 2011 we had availableforsale investments of 25 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale these investments consisting primarily of corporate bonds commercial paper us government agency bonds us treasuries and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 29 2011 would cause the fair value of these availableforsale investments to decline by approximately 36 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 29 2011 we recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of 45 million offset by 04 million of unrealized gains related to these securities the fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

if current market conditions deteriorate or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or otherthantemporary impairment charges to earnings in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures or other operating requirements see note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we held at april 29 2011 

lease commitments  — as of april 29 2011 one of our four lease arrangements with bnpplc is based on a floating interest rate the minimum lease payments will vary based on libor plus a spread all of our leases have an initial term of five years and we have the option to renew these leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate from the level at april 29 2011 would increase our lease payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the initial fiveyear term by an immaterial amount we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases 

  

convertible notes  — in june 2008 we issued 1265 billion principal amount of 175 notes due 2013 of which 1017 billion was allocated to debt and 0248 billion was allocated to equity holders may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 the notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount if any at an initial conversion rate of 314006 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the notes which represents an initial conversion price of 3185 per share 

concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock in fiscal 2010 we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to 20 of our note hedges and because we have decided not to replace the hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the 20 unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 

for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2011 our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 4141 per share set forth for these notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holder’s option through june 30 2011 and the carrying value of the notes was classified as a current liability as of april 29 2011 since the notes are convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount is required to be paid in cash the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of these notes is reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our consolidated balance sheets as of april 29 2011 the determination of whether or not the notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis consequently the notes may not be convertible in future quarters and therefore may again be classified as longterm debt if the contingent conversion thresholds are not met in such quarters 

upon conversion of any notes we deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock as of april 29 2011 shares issued related to the notes were minimal based on the closing price of our common stock of 5211 on april 29 2011 the ifconverted value of our notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately 8343 million 

the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes as of april 29 2011 the principal amount of our notes which consists of the combined debt and mezzanine components was 1265 billion and the total estimated fair value of such was 21 billion based on the closing trading price of 168 per 100 of our notes as of that date 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 29 2011 the timevalue component is recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

sales principal markets and distribution channels 

 

we market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world and we continue to make investments in our multiyear branding and awareness campaign to increase visibility of netapp in the broader it segment 

 

our diversified customer base spans a number of customer segments and vertical markets including energy financial services government high technology internet life sciences and healthcare services major manufacturing media entertainment animation and video postproduction and telecommunications we focus primarily on the data management and storage markets offering an array of solutions from our highend products designed for large enterprise customers to entrylevel products designed for midsized enterprise customers 

 

our solutions are positioned to address the emerging opportunities presented by cloud computing our unified storage architecture secure multitenancy capability scalable systems efficiency technologies and data management software functionality provide a powerful combination both for enterprises wanting to develop internal private clouds and for service providers who want to build it software storage and infrastructure as a service offerings 

 

as of the end of fiscal 2010 our worldwide sales and marketing function consisted of managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in more than 45 countries we employ a multichannel distribution strategy selling products and services to end users and service providers through a direct sales force and through channel partners including valueadded resellers system integrators original equipment manufacturers oems and distributors during fiscal year 2010 sales through our indirect channels represented 69 of our total revenues sales to customers arrow and avnet who are distributors accounted for approximately 14 and 11 of our net revenues respectively in fiscal 2010 and for approximately 11 and 10 of our net revenues respectively for fiscal 2009 no individual customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net 

revenues during fiscal 2008 information about our segment disclosures foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in note 16 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

seasonality 

 

we have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth quarter and because sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months during the second quarter of our fiscal year we have historically experienced increased sales driven by the government sector concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september as well as an increase in business from european markets we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

 

backlog 

 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis a substantial portion of our products are sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty in certain circumstances purchase orders are subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand as well as short leadtimes and product delivery schedules accordingly backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue 

 

manufacturing and supply chain 

 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee livingston scotland schiphol airport the netherlands shanghai china and singapore these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we multisource wherever possible to mitigate supply risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion 

 

we were awarded iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be iso 9001 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004 and continue to be iso 14001 certified 

 

research and development 

 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 research and development expenses represented 14 15 and 14 of our net revenues respectively these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

 

competition 

 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services and others that offer specific storage and data management products or services in the storage market our primary system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation through its acquisition of sun microsystems in addition dell inc is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with emc which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and 

software products as well as through dell’s acquisition of equallogic through which dell offers lowpriced storage solutions in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and oracle corporation through its acquisition of sun microsystems 

 

we believe that most of these companies compete based on their market presence products service or price some of these companies also compete by offering storage and data management products or services together with other it products or services at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 

 

we believe that we have a number of competitive advantages over many of these companies including product innovation and the relationships we have with our customers and partners we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance quality and operational efficiency we believe we have an advantage in the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and partners worldwide we strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product service and support offerings that enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase from us or from one of our partners 

 

an increase in industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

 

proprietary rights 

 

we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our netapp name and logo network appliance tm name and logo data ontap datafabric ®  faserver ®  flexvol filerview ®  nearstore ®  secureshare ®  snapdrive ®  snaplock snapmanager ®  snapmirror snaprestore snapvault wafl ®  and others as trademarks in the united states other us trademarks and us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers customers and suppliers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 

 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights and we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

environmental disclosure 

 

we seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality and worker health and safety we have made and will continue to make expenditures for environmental compliance and protection such expenditures have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations or competitive position 

 

we are voluntarily assessing our greenhouse gas emissions and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions for example through establishing employee commuter programs and evaluating the energy efficiency of 

our buildings various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs however because we are not an energy intensive business we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would be material to our operations 

 

we are also subject to other federal state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment various international federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws all of our products meet the requirements for weee rohs and china rohs compliance we have maintained an environmental management system since december 2004 as well as our iso 14001 certification as part of iso 14001 requirements we conduct an annual review of our operations and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help ensure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws 

 

working capital practices

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 3 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these 

forwardlooking statements if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain economic and market conditions 

 

we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology “it” market resulting in 

 

  

any of the above mentioned factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results have in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations during times of economic volatility these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

 12 

 

  

due to such factors operating results for a future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to forecast and a shortfall in revenue may harm our business and our operating results 

 

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast especially in times of economic uncertainty our revenues are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer new or additional product introductions also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 

 

we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets our financial results will be adversely impacted additionally due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast bookings and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to 

generate a bookings pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment and also because customers’ purchasing decisions are subject to delay reduction or cancellation small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 

 

economic uncertainties have caused and may in the future again cause consumers businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets credit decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence accordingly future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

 

we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 

 

changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a challenging operating environment for our business it is critical that we maintain appropriate alignment between our cost structure and our expected growth and revenues while at the same time continue to make strategic investments for future growth 

 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during periods of uneven growth we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits which could harm our operating results we have made and will continue to make significant investments in engineering sales service and support marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits revenue growth and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

conversely if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products we could also experience an adverse impact to our business operating results and financial condition if the storage and data management market fails to grow or grows slower than we expect our revenues will be adversely affected also even if it spending increases our revenues may not grow at the same pace 

 

our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

 

our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of product software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues 

 

our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

 14 

 

  

changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

due to such factors gross margins are subject to variations from period to period and are difficult to predict 

 

an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and oracle corporation through its acquisition of sun microsystems in addition dell inc is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with emc which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products as well as through dell’s acquisition of equallogic through which dell offers lowpriced storage solutions in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and oracle corporation through its acquisition of sun microsystems 

 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years for example in january 2010 oracle corporation one of our strategic partners completed its acquisition of sun microsystems one of our competitors in addition in july 2009 emc one of our competitors acquired data domain we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties including some of our partners for example in november 2009 cisco and emc together with vmware announced a virtual computing environment coalition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales 

 

if we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our distributors or if our distributors fail to effectively manage the sale of our products or services on our behalf our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

we market and sell our storage data management solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect channels during fiscal 2010 revenues generated from sales from our indirect channel distribution accounted for 69 of our revenues in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 

 

several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our indirect channel distribution model which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins including the following 

 

  

there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new indirect channel partners retain these indirect channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement indirect channel partners in the future especially in light of changes in end customer demand patterns and changes in available and competing technologies from competitors the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met our inability to effectively establish train retain and manage our distribution channel could harm our sales 

 

in addition we depend on our indirect channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

our oem relationship may not continue to generate significant revenues 

 

in april 2005 we entered into an oem agreement with ibm which enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on netapp unified solutions including nearstore ® and vseries systems as well as associated software offerings while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore this relationship may not continue to generate significant revenues in addition we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell or its release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control its pricing 

 

in the event that sales through our oem relationship increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oem or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts or if our oem relationship does not continue to generate significant revenues our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

a portion of our revenues is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has and in the future could negatively affect our revenues 

 

during fiscal 2010 sales to distributors arrow and avnet accounted for approximately 14 and 11 respectively of our net revenues the loss of orders from these or any of our more significant customers strategic partners distributors or resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors including the costeffectiveness reliability scalability and comprehensiveness of our product offerings and our ability to address customer demands 

 

we also have an agreement with fujitsu technology solutions “fujitsu” which enables fujitsu to lease sell market and resell netapp products to end users and fujitsu sales partners worldwide and to integrate netapp products into fujitsu bundled offerings as well as to market netapp’s support services 

 

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 

 

unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if the uncertainty in the economy continues or conditions deteriorate and our sales decline our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 

because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to or unexpected returns from customers and resellers or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business we expect that our largest customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today end users could stop purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing our products at any time the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter could harm our operating results in addition a change in the pricing practices of one or more of our large customers could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 

 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us future revenue from the us government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns a decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues in addition our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the us government 

 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage and data management market and for us however government demand is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

 

in addition selling our products to the us government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements for example in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice “doj” and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” under which we paid the united states 1280 million plus interest of 07 million related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 the failure to comply with us government regulatory requirements could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results and financial position 

 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenues may be impacted negatively 

 

an element of our strategy to increase revenues is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with the vendors we have significant partner relationships with database business application backup management and server 

virtualization companies including microsoft oracle sap symantec and vmware in addition in november 2009 we announced our intention to expand our relationship with fujitsu and in january 2010 we announced an expansion of our collaboration with cisco and vmware including a cooperative support arrangement a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners these partnerships may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could experience lower than expected revenue growth suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

 

in addition some of our partners including oracle cisco and vmware are also partnering with other storage vendors which may increase the availability of competing solutions harm our ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners 

 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data management solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships our future revenues and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if the performance of these markets does not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets the markets for storage and data management have been recently adversely impacted by the global economic uncertainty and as a result of continued uncertainty the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline 

 

additionally emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

 

the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components utilized in the assembly of our products which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 

 

financial problems of either contract manufacturers component suppliers or other parties in our supply chain and reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs of our products qualifying a new contract manufacturer and 

commencing volume production is expensive and timeconsuming and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity from any contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately procure inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease as the demand for our products has increased we have experienced and may continue to experience tightening of supply of some components leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints which has and in the future could continue to result in the delay of shipments 

 

we are exposed to the credit and nonpayment risk of our customers resellers and distributors especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets which could result in material losses 

 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay 

 

beyond our open credit arrangements we also have recourse and nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements using third party leasing companies under the terms of recourse leases which are treated as offbalance sheet arrangements we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party leasing company in the event of enduser customer default we also offer financing arrangements whereby the enduser customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable amount based on actual storage capacity used these arrangements subject us to additional risk around revenue recognition and profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the variable portion of the arrangements in addition from time to time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by enduser customers 

 

we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic uncertainty our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 

 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers both who have open credit and who have lease financing arrangements with us causing us to incur bad debt charges and in the case of financing arrangements a loss of revenues we may be subject to similar losses in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our product could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

 

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause substantial fluctuation in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 19 

 

  

in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on it could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 

 

changes in market conditions have led and in the future could lead to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 

 

in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands we may decide to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring disposing of or otherwise discontinuing certain products any decision to limit investment in dispose of or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings including inventory and technologyrelated or other intangible asset writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products which would harm our operating results our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings which could materially harm our operating results 

 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance if we fail to manage the interoperability and transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues and subject us to additional financial and operational risks if they are not managed effectively we could experience material risks to our operations financial condition and business model 

 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

 

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from sales outside of the united states during fiscal 2010 our international revenues accounted for 50 of our total revenues a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us and we have research and development and service centers overseas accordingly our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts in addition we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets conversely lowering our price in local currency may result in lower usbased revenues a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses in foreign markets additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can experience extreme volatility we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a shortterm basis all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter the timevalue component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have a negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include inaccuracies in forecasting widening interest rate differentials and volatility in the foreign exchange market our hedging strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

certain united states government export restrictions impede our ability to sell to certain end users certain of our products the united states through the bureau of industry security places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology these restrictions may include the requirement to have a license to export the technology the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country certain of our products are subject to various levels of export restrictions these export restrictions could negatively impact our business our international operations are subject to other risks including general importexport restrictions regulations related to data privacy and other complex rules and regulations under which we must conduct business in foreign countries we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law such factors could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 

 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of these policies any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for united states federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result on future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the obama administration has announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings should such antideferral provisions be enacted our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 

 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement in recent years several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which has resulted in material proposed assessments andor litigation with respect to those companies 

 

during fiscal year 2009 we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax returns we filed a protest with the irs in response to the notices of proposed adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from the irs examination team in response to our protest we recently were informed by the irs that this audit will proceed to the irs appeals level for further administrative review the notices of proposed adjustments in this audit focus primarily on issues of the timing and the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years 

 

the irs recently commenced the examination of our fiscal 2005 through 2007 federal income tax returns and in addition the california franchise tax board has notified us of their intent to examine our fiscal 2007 and 2008 california tax returns the scope of the irs and california franchise tax board examinations are unclear at this time 

 

if the ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april 30 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and our earnings per share 

 

as a result of the sale of our notes we have a greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past in addition we have various synthetic lease arrangements related to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale california and subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financing agreements we may incur additional debt our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability to us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds or we may be required to raise additional funds through other means if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

 

the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the “counterparties” which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with these hedging transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any 

of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our shareholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman otc” was the counterparty to 20 of our note hedges the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc on october 3 2008 constituted an “event of default” under the hedge transaction in april 2010 we terminated the hedge transaction with lehman otc in exchange for an unsecured bankruptcy claim which we subsequently sold to a third party for approximately 14 million because we have decided not to replace the hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the 20 unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 the terms of the notes the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination of this hedge 

 

the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the notes and warrants 

 

future issuances of common stock related to our notes warrants stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the notes 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes we will satisfy our obligation upon conversion by delivering cash for the principal amount of the notes and shares of common stock if any to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount any new issuance of equity securities including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our note hedges could dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

 

as of april 30 2010 we had options to purchase approximately 35 million shares of our common stock outstanding and a total of approximately 9 million restricted shares and restricted stock units outstanding if all of these outstanding options were exercised and all of the outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units vested the proceeds to the company would average approximately 18 per share we also had 155 million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to equity awards that have not been granted the exercise of all of the outstanding options andor the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan espp under which employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a twoyear period as of april 30 2010 we had approximately 50 million shares of our common stock available for issuance under the espp the issuance of shares under the espp would dilute the interests of our thenexisting stockholders and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons including to finance our operations related to business strategy including in connection with acquisitions strategic alliances or other transactions to increase our capital to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options upon conversion of the notes or for other reasons 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

 

at april 30 2010 we had 38 billion in cash cash equivalents availableforsale securities and restricted cash and investments we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in us treasury securities commercial paper us government agency bonds corporate bonds auction rate securities certificates of deposit and money market funds these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis and bankruptcy filings in the united states which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues these securities are generally classified as “availableforsale” and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

 

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates currently we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

 

the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets for instance as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers which occurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments any investment securities that we hold or the issues of such securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary 

 

on occasion we make strategic investments in other companies including private equity funds which may decline in value andor not meet desired objectives the success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control as of april 30 2010 we had an investment with the carrying value of 14 million in a private equity fund the risks to our strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and as a result the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges 

 

in the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some or all of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring further impairments which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 

 

a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and to service our debt we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 

 

a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences which could adversely affect our financial results as a result if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such 

additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities develop new products respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 

our synthetic leases are offbalance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure which will increase our fixed costs our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 

 

we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor “bbpplc” for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale california these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for leases and are not considered variable interest entities under applicable accounting guidance therefore we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet however if circumstances were to change regarding our or bnpplc’s ownership of the properties or in bnpplc’s overall portfolio we could be required to consolidate the entity the leased facilities and the associated debt 

 

our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs our operating results will be harmed if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc as of april 30 2010 the estimated fair value of the properties was approximately 369 million below the guaranteed minimum residual value which we will accrue over the remaining term of the respective leases any further decline in the fair value of the properties could adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and operating results 

 

as a result of excess capacity in our sunnyvale facilities certain of our facilities subject to synthetic lease arrangements have been subleased or are vacant these subleases will expire through 2012 and we may not be able to generate sufficient sublease income to cover the carrying costs of these facilities in addition we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities under operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties 

 

in order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk should there be a counterparty default we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 

 

we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic lease arrangements the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 

 

our ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts or repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements if we lose access to the synthetic lease arrangements we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms which could limit our operating flexibility 

the agreements governing our synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

as a result of these restrictive covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted we may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 

 

our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our synthetic lease arrangements which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangement in addition our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the notes which could permit the holders to accelerate the notes if all of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 

 

funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for more than 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience further otherthantemporary declines in value which would adversely affect our earnings 

 

auction rate securities arss held by us are securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase interest rates for ars are reset through a “dutch auction” each month which prior to february 2008 had provided a liquid market for these securities 

 

all of our arss are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee however liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments with a par value of 738 million for each failed auction the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop or the final maturity of the individual securities 

 

as of april 30 2010 we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 47 million of which we have recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of 26 million and 21 million was recognized as an otherthantemporary impairment charge in addition we have classified all of our auction rate securities as longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets at april 30 2010 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain although we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity if current market conditions deteriorate further or the anticipated recovery in market liquidity does not occur we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 

we may need to undertake costreduction initiatives and restructuring initiatives in the future 

 

we have previously recognized restructuring charges related to initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our business in response to economic and market conditions including those announced in february 2009 and december 2008 we may undertake future costreduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 

 

our acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may disrupt our existing business 

 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities the success of our acquisitions is impacted by a number of factors and may be subject to the following risks 

 

  

any future acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business including 

 

  

the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill or acquired intangibles for example in fiscal 2009 we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of our smos product which was originally acquired through our acquisition of topio inc in fiscal 2007 resulting in the impairment of acquired intangibles related to such acquisition additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm our business 

 

if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement all or a portion of the revenues relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods 

 

in the course of our sales efforts we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance and storage review services if we are required to change the pricing of our softwarerelated elements through discounting or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements we may be unable to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement a delay in the recognition of revenues may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient including moving activities from highercost to lowercost owned locations as well as outsourcing certain business process functions problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide for example certain engineering activities and projects that were formerly performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations and we rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain business process functions and activities in it human resources and accounting 

 

the challenges involved with these initiatives include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures we are also subject to increased business continuity risks as we increase our reliance on such parties for example we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes including the management and internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business services as anticipated we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally which could be costly and timeconsuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition we may not achieve the expected benefits of our business process improvement initiatives 

 

we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits 

 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for workers’ compensation coverage and health care plans we record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the number and costs of expected claims administrative costs and stoploss premiums these estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stoploss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely impact our financial condition 

 

in march 2010 comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act hr 3590 and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act hr 4872 collectively the “acts” was passed and signed into law among other things the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years the department of health and human services the national association of insurance commissioners the department of labor and the treasury department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation 

 

due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phasedin nature of the implementation it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation include reduced revenues increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new 

products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified employees particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees particularly our engineers salespeople and key managers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

additionally a component of our strategy to hire and retain personnel consists of longterm compensation in the form of equitybased grants we face increased risk of the inability to continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval in light of increased shareholder activism and heightened focus on corporate compensation practices such inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract and retain employees 

 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military terrorism global trade world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes volcanoes power loss power shortages environmental disasters telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues gross margins and operating results 

 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

in addition if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and these occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues gross margins and operating results we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages 

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business including our ongoing litigation with sun microsystems which was recently acquired by oracle corporation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection 

some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable or where any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products and climate change issues 

 

we continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products as a result governmental and nongovernmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions there is a risk that the development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it industry or will favor certain technological approaches depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted compliance could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

 

climate change issues energy usage and emissions controls may result in new environmental legislation and regulations at any or all of the international federal and state levels that may unfavorably impact us our suppliers and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design development and manufacturing of our products this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

 

our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a consequence of regulations or business trends such as 

 

 31 

 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

 

we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april 30 2010 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 30 2010 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

 

because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition standards recently adopted by the fasb the increased use of fair value measure and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference 

overview 

 

revenues for fiscal 2010 were 39 billion up 05 billion or 15 from fiscal 2009 improved revenue performance in fiscal 2010 was the result of improvements in product software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a 1287 million settlement with the general services administration gsa the dispute regarded our discounting practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 

 

gross profit margins increased during fiscal 2010 due largely to reductions in product materials cost partially offset by a decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products as well as an increase in our sem and services revenues mix relative to product revenues in addition our gross profit margin in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the gsa settlement 

 

during fiscal 2010 sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses totaled 21 billion up 10 from fiscal 2009 and reflected the impact of an increase in incentive compensation and commissions expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit performance as well as having 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009 

 

during fiscal 2010 we entered into a merger agreement with data domain inc which was subsequently terminated on july 8 2009 in accordance with the agreement we received a 570 million termination fee which when netted against 159 million of incremental thirdparty costs we incurred relating to the terminated merger transaction resulted in net proceeds of 411 million 

 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

 

we believe that the following accounting policies are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 

 

we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

 

revenue recognition reserves and allowances 

 

we apply the provisions of the accounting guidance for software revenue recognition to our product sales both hardware and software because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware we recognize revenue when 

 

 37 

 

  

our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance and storage review services our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues from software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from one to three years we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we typically sell professional services separately from any of our other revenue elements either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered for arrangements with multiple elements we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements “the residual method” 

 

for our undelivered softwarerelated elements we determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately to determine the fair value of these elements we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices we believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements if vsoe cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements it is required that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered 

 

for purposes of presentation in the statement of operations once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance based on vsoe of its fair value with the remainder allocated to other service revenues 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods while we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 30 2010 was 16 million compared to 31 million as of april 24 2009 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals 

 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold historically our inventory reserves have been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods 

 

in the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products we establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in future operations to the extent that such forecasts are not achieved our commitments and associated accruals may change 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations which may require us to incur higher costs and adversely impact our operating results 

 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

 

purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite inprocess research and development is capitalized at fair value and classified as indefinitelived assets until completion or abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our operating results 

 

we perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required which would adversely affect our operating results in fiscal 2010 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill 

 

restructuring reserves 

 

we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction intangibles and fixed assets writeoffs and noncancelable lease costs related to excess facilities severancerelated charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments we record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated the decision to eliminate 

excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises intangible asset writeoffs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of specific products fixed assets writeoffs primarily consist of equipment software and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture 

 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future 

 

product warranties 

 

estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material distribution and labor costs our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and other longterm obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units estimated material costs estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered necessary 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation using the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

 

fair value measurements and impairments 

 

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value and our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices liquidation values or other metrics for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 

 

the fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below 

 

  

we measure our availableforsale securities at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale securities include us treasury securities us government agency bonds corporate bonds commercial paper arss money market funds and certificates of deposit where possible we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as level 1 in the hierarchy when quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable varying valuation techniques are used such assets are classified as level 2 or level 3 in the hierarchy we classify items in level 2 if investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency we classify items in level 3 if investments are valued using a pricing model based on unobservable inputs in the market or that require us to develop our own assumptions our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment 

 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our availableforsale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments we monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges 

 

we actively review current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary as of april 30 2010 and april 24 2009 our shortterm and longterm investments in marketable securities have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value availableforsale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as shortterm investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements currently all marketable securities held by us are classified as availableforsale and our entire ars portfolio is classified as longterm investments 

 

our ars portfolio consists of securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at the time of purchase during fiscal 2008 we reclassified all of our investments in ars from shortterm investments to longterm investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately 33 million during fiscal 2010 partially offset by 07 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income loss 

during fiscal 2009 we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately 70 million partially offset by 03 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income loss in addition during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment loss of 21 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ars related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades 

 

the valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ars included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security expected cash flows discount rates credit ratings workout periods and overall capital market liquidity these assumptions assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties are difficult to predict and require significant judgment the use of different assumptions or applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value there is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize the fair value of our ars could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio we will continue to monitor the fair value of our ars and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or otherthantemporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges 

 

as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers which occurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments during fiscal 2010 we sold our remaining holdings of lehman brothers bonds and the primary fund made multiple distributions of its assets to its investors and as of april 30 2010 we recovered our recorded investment with the exception of 02 million for which we recognized an additional loss as of april 30 2010 we no longer had any direct or indirect investments related to lehman brothers and have recognized all related losses in our statement of operations 

 

during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 recognized gains and losses on availableforsale investments were not material management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date the fair value of our marketable securities including those included in cash equivalents and longterm investments was 36052 million and 25966 million as of april 30 2010 and april 24 2009 respectively 

 

to determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments we use the most recent information available to us including new financings or estimates of current fair value as well as through traditional valuation techniques it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are otherthantemporarily impaired in the case of privatelyheld companies this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies if we believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value and this difference is otherthantemporary it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value the carrying value of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 14 million and 39 million as of april 30 2010 and april 24 2009 respectively during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we recorded 34 million of gains and 63 million of net impairment charges in our consolidated statements of operations respectively for our investments in privatelyheld companies and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be otherthantemporary 

 

income taxes 

 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the united states and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures 

 

we have provided a valuation allowance of 283 million as of april 30 2010 compared to 280 million as of april 24 2009 and 286 million as of april 25 2008 on certain of our deferred tax assets the changes in valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were primarily related to changes in the blended state tax rates the tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards net of their corresponding valuation allowance at april 30 2010 are 3586 million 

 

we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns based on a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in applicable tax law settlement of issues under audit and new exposures if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination

discussion and analysis of results of operations 

 

net revenues  — our net revenues for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were as follows in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

net revenues increased by 5250 million or 15 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and by 1032 million or 3 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2010 was primarily related to an increase in product revenues while the increase in fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and 

maintenance sem and services revenues partially offset by decreases in product revenues additionally net revenues for fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by the 1287 million gsa settlement 

 

sales through our indirect channels represented 69 69 and 63 of net revenues for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the indirect channel mix for 2009 would have been 3 higher if not for the impact of the gsa settlement 

 

the following table sets forth sales to customers who are distributors who accounted for 10 or more of revenues in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

product revenues in millions except percentages

during fiscal 2010 highend midrange and lowend systems generated approximately 23 56 and 21 of configured systems revenues respectively compared to approximately 24 55 and 21 respectively in fiscal 2009 and approximately 25 59 and 16 respectively in fiscal 2008 overall average selling prices asps declined in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to a shift in mix towards lowend systems as well as lower asps per unit in midrange and lowend systems asps declined in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower asps in all systems ranges and a shift in mix towards lowend systems 

 

in addition our net addon hardware software and other product revenues accounted for an 885 million increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and a 1024 million increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to customers increasing the capacity of their storage systems 

 

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this wide variation in customer configurations can significantly impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profit performance price changes unit volumes customer mix and product configuration can also impact revenues cost of revenues and gross profit performance disks are a significant component of our storage systems industry disk pricing continues to fall every year and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain relatively constant profit margins on our disk drives while our sales price per terabyte continues to decline improved system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 30 2010 

liquidity sources cash requirements 

 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 30 2010 consisted of approximately 37 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and cash we expect to generate from operations 

 

cash cash equivalents and investments consist of the following 

 

 

 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities research and development capital expenditure needs investment in critical or complementary technologies and to service our debt and synthetic leases 

 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability as well as our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories based on our current business outlook we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases contractual obligations commitments interest payments on our notes and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions in light of the current economic and market conditions we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

 

our contractual obligations as of april 30 2010 are summarized below in the contractual obligations tables 

 

our investment portfolio including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets however we are not dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve months in order to meet our liquidity needs we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other potential sources of cash we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions or other cash requirements we intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers if current market conditions deteriorate we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods 

 

capital expenditure requirements 

 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities and equipment operating leases over the next few years through existing cash cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products product mix changes in the network storage industry hiring plans and our decisions related to financing our facilities requirement we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california rtp north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed 

 

acquisition related requirements 

 

on april 6 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire bycast inc for approximately 80 million in cash the merger was completed on may 13 2010 

cash flows 

 

as of april 30 2010 compared to april 24 2009 our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 11 billion to 37 billion the increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities and issuances of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan partially offset by capital expenditures we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital days sales outstanding as of april 30 2010 decreased to 37 days compared to 46 days as of april 24 2009 primarily due to improvements in shipment linearity and collections performance working capital increased by 09 billion to 26 billion as of april 30 2010 compared to 18 billion as of april 24 2009 primarily due to an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 11 billion 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 9750 million and 8892 million respectively the primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of 4004 million adjusted by noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1598 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 1660 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of 1767 million and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of 532 million the primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of 646 million adjusted by noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1408 million depreciation and amortization expense of 1705 million and a deferred tax provision of 1246 million significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2009 included a decrease in accounts receivable of 1287 million an increase in deferred revenue of 2193 million and an increase in other current liabilities of 1287 million related to the gsa settlement 

 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections performance inventory and supply chain management tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were 1356 million which included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in bangalore india for approximately 285 million compared to 2896 million in fiscal 2009 we paid 8603 million for net purchases and redemptions of shortterm investments in fiscal 2010 compared to 1168 million in fiscal 2009 in addition in fiscal 2009 we reclassified 5980 million of cash equivalents related to the primary fund to shortterm investments

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee equity award programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees exercise stock options or participate in our espp program generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits will vary

the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 30 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 

 

 

 

some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

as of april 30 2010 we have four leasing arrangements leasing arrangements 1 2 3 and 4 with bnpplc which requires us to lease certain of our land to bnpplc for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 06 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale which had an original cost of 1496 million under these leasing arrangements we pay bnpplc minimum lease payments which vary based on libor plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates we make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years we have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc upon expiration or upon any earlier termination of the lease terms we must elect one of the following options i purchase the buildings from bnpplc at cost ii if certain conditions are met arrange for the sale of the buildings by bnpplc to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts or iii pay bnpplc supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by bnpplc during the ensuing twoyear period the following table summarizes the costs the residual guarantee the applicable libor plus spread or fixed rate at april 30 2010 and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements in millions 

 

 

 

all leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of april 30 2010 such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and a minimum amount of unencumbered cash and shortterm investments our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option would give bnpplc the right to among other things i terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements or ii exercise certain foreclosure remedies if we were to exercise our purchase option or be required to pay lease termination damages these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity which could constrain our operating flexibility 

 

as of april 30 2010 we estimated that the fair value of the properties under synthetic lease was 369 million less than their aggregate residual guarantees we are accruing for this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective leases 

we may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our operating or other objectives 

 

legal contingencies 

 

on september 5 2007 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against sun microsystems on october 25 2007 sun microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction on october 29 2007 sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the northern district of california asserting additional patents against us the texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the texas lawsuit to the northern district of california on november 26 2007 on march 26 2008 sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in january 2008 in january 2010 oracle acquired sun the three lawsuits are currently in the discovery and motion phase and no trial dates have been set so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations in addition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement no accrual has been recorded as of april 30 2010 

 

in addition we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of business while the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow operating results or financial condition 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 30 2010 our financial guarantees of 51 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds which were primarily related to selfinsurance 

 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency the program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes currently we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below 

 

  

as of april 30 2010 our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 4842 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because of the short term maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid see note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to our hedging activities 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into recourse lease financing arrangements with thirdparty leasing companies and from time to time provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to the thirdparty funding companies in the event of nonpayment by enduser customers see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to these financing arrangements 

we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance 

 

we have commitments related to four lease arrangements with bnpplc for approximately 06 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale california as further described above under “contractual obligations” 

 

we have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have determined the following 

 

  

accordingly under current accounting guidance we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnpplc lease our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of 1367 million as discussed in above in “contractual obligations”

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

 

market risk and market interest risk 

 

investment and interest income  — as of april 30 2010 we had availableforsale investments of 21 billion our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale these investments consisting primarily of corporate bonds commercial paper us government agency bonds us treasuries and certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2010 would cause the fair value of these availableforsale investments to decline by approximately 36 million volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 30 2010 we recorded cumulative unrealized loss of 33 million offset by 07 million of unrealized gains related to these securities the fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

 

if current market conditions deteriorate or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or otherthantemporary impairment charges to earnings in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures or other operating requirements see note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we held at april 30 2010 

 

lease commitments  — as of april 30 2010 one of our four lease arrangements with bnpplc is based on a floating interest rate the minimum lease payments will vary based on libor plus a spread all of our leases have an initial term of five years and we have the option to renew these leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate from the level at april 30 2010 would increase our lease payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the initial fiveyear term by an immaterial amount we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases 

 

convertible notes  — in june 2008 we issued 1265 billion principal amount of 175 notes due 2013 of which 1017 billion was allocated to debt and 0248 billion was allocated to equity holders may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to 

 

  

the notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount if any at an initial conversion rate of 314006 shares of common stock per one thousand principal amount of notes subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the notes which represents an initial conversion price of 3185 per share 

 

upon conversion a holder will receive cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount of the notes and any shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the notes concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock in fiscal 2010 we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to 20 of our note hedges and because we have decided not to replace the hedge we are subject to potential dilution on the 20 unhedged portion of our notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 

as of april 30 2010 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the notes to convert had been met and we had not issued any shares related to the notes based on the closing price of our common stock of 3467 on april 30 2010 the ifconverted value of our notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately 112 million 

 

the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes as of april 30 2010 the principal amount of our notes which consists of the combined debt and equity components was 1265 billion and the total estimated fair value of such was 15 billion based on the closing trading price of 120 per 100 of our notes as of that date 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 30 2010 the timevalue component is recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 

 

the following table provides information about our currency forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2010 and april 24 2009 in millions

seasonality 

 

as the size of our business has grown we have begun to see a seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year in addition we also see some international seasonality as sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months sales to the us government tend to be seasonally stronger during our second fiscal quarter concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september additionally we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 

 

backlog 

 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped 

within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenues

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in memphis tennessee fremont california  san jose california olive branch mississippi livingston scotland shanghai china singapore and schiphol airport the netherlands these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we multisource wherever possible to mitigate supply risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be iso 9001 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004 and continue to be iso 14001 certified 

 

research and development 

 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 research and development expenses represented 146 137 and 137 of our net revenues respectively these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

 

competition 

 

we compete with many companies in the markets we serve including companies that offer a broad spectrum of it products and services and others that offer specific storage and data management products or services in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and sun microsystems in addition dell inc is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with emc which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products as well as through its acquisition of equallogic through which dell offers lowpriced storage solutions in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems our vtl products also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space additionally a number of small newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline and vtl storage markets and the highperformance clustered storage markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

 

we believe that most of these companies compete based on their market presence products service or price some of these companies also compete by offering storage and data management products or services together with other it products or services at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 

 

we believe that we have a number of competitive advantages over many of these companies including product innovation and the relationships we have with our customers and partners we believe the advantages of our products include functionality scalability performance quality and operational efficiency we believe our advantages in customer and partner relationships include a worldwide storage and data managementfocused direct sales force a broad network of channel partners relationships with enterprise software vendors and service offerings that enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise before during and after their purchase of solutions from us

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 3 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions including the current economic downturn 

 

we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and are currently contributing to slowdowns in the computer storage and networking industries at large as well as the information technology “it” market resulting in 

 

 11 

 

  

the turmoil in the global credit markets the recent instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions the economic challenges we initially experienced in the united states have spread throughout the world if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets remain uncertain persist or deteriorate further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results have in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

 12 

 

  

due to such factors operating results for a future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to forecast and a shortfall in revenue may harm our business and our operating results 

 

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast especially in light of the current global economic downturn and related market uncertainty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer new or additional product introductions also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 

 

additionally we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets our financial results will be adversely impacted 

 

we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast bookings and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into contracts varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in particular the continued adverse events in the economic environment and financial markets have made it even more difficult for us to forecast our future results and may result in a reduction in our quarterly conversion rate as our customers’ purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled 

 

uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions has caused consumers businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter credit decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence accordingly future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 

 

the ongoing global financial crisis has led to a worldwide economic downturn that has negatively affected our business if the current economic downturn continues or worsens demand for our products and services and our revenues may be further reduced a prolonged downturn can adversely affect our revenues gross margin and results of operations during such economic downturns it is critical to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and to minimize the effect of such downturns on our operations while also maintaining our capabilities and strategic investments for future growth 

 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs and if revenue levels are below our expectations operating results will be adversely impacted during uneven periods of growth we may incur costs before we realize some of the anticipated benefits which could harm our operating results we have significant investments in engineering sales service support marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

conversely if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products we could experience a material adverse effect on operations and financial results if the network storage market fails to grow or grows slower than we expect our revenues will be adversely affected also even if it spending increases our revenue may not grow at the same pace 

 

our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

 

our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

 14 

 

  

changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

due to such factors gross margins are subject to variations from period to period and are difficult to predict 

 

our costreduction initiatives and restructuring plans may not result in anticipated savings or more efficient operations our recentlyannounced restructuring may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operations and financial results 

 

on february 11 2009 in response to the worsening global economic conditions and uncertainty about future it spending we announced a restructuring of our worldwide operations in an effort to strategically align our cost structure with expected revenues as well as to reallocate resources into areas of our business with more growth potential 

 

additionally in december 2008 we decided to cease development and availability of our snapmirror ® for open systems “smos” product and as a result recorded restructuring and other charges attributable primarily to severance and employeerelated and facility closure costs as well as the impairment of certain acquired intangible assets 

 

we may not be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of these restructuring plans our restructuring plans may involve higher costs or a longer timetable or they may fail to improve our gross margins results of operations and cash flows as we anticipate our inability to realize these benefits may result in an ineffective business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations in addition to costs related to severance and other employeerelated costs our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses 

 

in addition our restructuring plans may have other adverse consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce the loss of employees with valuable knowledge or expertise a negative impact on employee morale or a gain in competitive advantage by our competitors over us the restructuring efforts could also be disruptive to our daytoday operations and cause our remaining employees to be less productive which in turn may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future in the event that the economy recovers sooner than we expect and results in increased it spending we may not have sufficient capacity to capitalize on the related increase in demand for our products and services 

 

we may undertake future costreduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 

 

changes in market conditions have led and in the future could lead to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 

 

in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring disposing of or otherwise discontinuing certain products any decision to limit investment in dispose of or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings such as inventory and technologyrelated or other intangible asset writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products which would harm our operating results our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions additionally we 

are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings which could materially harm our operating results 

 

our oem relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenue 

 

in april 2005 we entered into an oem agreement with ibm which enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on netappunified solutions including nearstore ® and vseries systems as well as associated software offerings while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore this relationship may not continue to contribute revenue in future years in addition we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell or its release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control its pricing in the event that sales through ibm increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts our operating results and financial condition could be harmed we cannot assure you that this oem relationship will continue to generate significant revenue while the agreement is in effect or that the relationship will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenue may be impacted negatively 

 

an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors we have significant partner relationships with database business application backup management and server virtualization companies including microsoft oracle sap symantec and vmware a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners these partnerships may not generate significant revenue or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales 

 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these channel partners during fiscal 2009 revenues generated from sales through our channel partners accounted for 690 of our revenues in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 

 

several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins including the following 

 

 16 

 

  

in addition we depend on our channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us future revenue from the us government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns a decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues in addition our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the us government 

 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us however government demand is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns our revenues and operating results may be harmed 

 

in addition selling our products to the us government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements the failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results for example in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice “doj” and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” under which we agreed to pay the united states 1280 million plus interest of 07 million related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 we are currently in discussions with the us government to demonstrate that we have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that we comply with federal contracting rules if we are unable to demonstrate to the us government that we have implemented such improved policies and procedures or if we are subject to an adverse outcome in any future examinations of our federal contracting practices we could be suspended or debarred from contracting with the us government generally or with any specific agency which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

 

a portion of our revenue is generated by large recurring purchases from various customers resellers and distributors a loss cancellation or delay in purchases by these parties has and could continue to negatively affect our revenue 

 

during fiscal 2009 two us distributors accounted for approximately 105 and 106 of our revenues respectively the loss of continued orders from any of our more significant customers strategic partners distributors or resellers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors including the costeffectiveness reliability scalability breadth and depth of our products 

 

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large recurring orders from these customers resellers or distributors for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 

 

recent turmoil in the credit markets may further negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers resellers and distributors or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products if the global economy and credit markets continue to deteriorate and our future sales decline our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 

because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to or unexpected returns from customers and resellers or the loss of any significant customer or reseller 

could harm our business although our largest customers may vary from period to period we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from significant customers in addition a change in the mix of our customers could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

 

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers resellers and distributors as well as credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

 

most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay beyond our open credit arrangements we also have recourse or nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements with third party leasing companies through preexisting relationships with customers under the terms of recourse leases which are treated as offbalance sheet arrangements we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party leasing company in the event that any customers default we expect demand for customer financing to continue during periods of economic downturn in the storage industry and the global economy our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases in addition our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by the current global economic downturn or if there is a continuation or worsening of the downturn although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks such programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks 

 

in the past there have been bankruptcies by our customers both who have open credit and who have lease financing arrangements with us causing us to incur bad debt charges and in the case of financing arrangements a loss of revenues there can be no assurance that additional losses will not occur in future periods any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing those customers’ ability to purchase our product could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

 

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on it as well as variations in our expected operating performance could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the 

market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues and if not managed effectively may adversely affect our sales of existing products 

 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

 

an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hitachi data systems hp ibm and sun microsystems in addition dell inc is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with emc which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products as well as through dell’s acquisition of equallogic through which dell offers lowpriced storage solutions in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems our vtl products also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space additionally a number of small newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline and vtl storage markets and the highperformance clustered storage markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years for example in april 2009 oracle corporation one of our strategic partners announced its plan to acquire sun microsystems we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if these markets do not perform as we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets the markets for storage and data management have been adversely impacted by the current global economic downturn and may not grow as anticipated or may continue to decline 

 

additionally emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix ®  windows ® and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 

 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

 

the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 

 

financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could limit supply increase costs or result in accelerated payment terms the loss of any contract manufacturer or key supplier could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity or component supply could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed 

 

a return to growth in the economy is likely to put greater pressures on us our contract manufacturers and our suppliers to accurately project demand and to establish optimal purchase commitment levels additionally the reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies inside or outside of our industry or the inability by us to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our manufacturing or components requirements based upon business needs could result in either limitation of supply or increased costs from these suppliers 

 

if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products or if there is lack of demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which would increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our gross margins 

 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products in recent years rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 

 

furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market or in amounts greater than 

our needs in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used or are committed to buy components in amounts greater than our needs our gross margins could decrease 

 

component quality is a risk and is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity 

 

as suppliers upgrade their components they regularly “end of life” older components as we become aware of an end of life situation we attempt to make purchases or purchase commitments to cover all future requirements or find a suitable substitute component we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis our failure to do so may lead to an adverse impact on our business on the other hand if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly or if there is reduced demand or no demand for our products an oversupply of end of life components could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins 

 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers or our component suppliers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products and materials suitable for our needs could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

 

our acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may disrupt our existing business 

 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities on may 20 2009 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire data domain inc “data domain” we subsequently amended the terms of the definitive agreement on june 3 2009 

 

the success of this and any future acquisition is impacted by a number of factors and may be subject to the following risks 

 

  

this and any future acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business including 

 

  

in addition failure to complete the data domain acquisition as planned could negatively impact our stock price 

 

the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill or acquired intangibles for example in fiscal 2009 we announced our decision to cease the development 

and availability of our smos product which was originally acquired through our acquisition of topio inc “topio” in fiscal 2007 resulting in the impairment of acquired intangibles related to such acquisition additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm our business 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

 

at april 24 2009 we had 26 billion in cash cash equivalents availableforsale securities and restricted cash and investments we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in us treasury securities us government agency bonds corporate bonds corporate securities auction rate securities certificates of deposit and money market funds including the primary fund these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis and bankruptcy filings in the united states which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues these securities are generally classified as “availableforsale” and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

 

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates currently we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

 

the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary 

 

as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers which occurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments as of april 24 2009 we have an investment in the primary fund an aaarated money market fund at the time of purchase with a par value of 609 million and an estimated fair value of 516 million which suspended redemptions in september 2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments we received total distributions of 5463 million during fiscal 2009 from the primary fund on december 3 2008 it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims as well as anticipated costs and expenses including related legal and accounting fees on february 26 2009 the primary fund announced a plan to set aside 35 billion of the fund’s remaining assets as the “special reserve” which may be increased or decreased as further information becomes available the primary fund has received an sec order providing that the sec will supervise the distribution of assets from the primary fund our pro rata share of the 35 billion special reserve is approximately 415 million the primary fund plans to continue to make periodic distributions up to the amount of the special reserve on a prorata basis we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund 

if the conditions in the credit and capital markets continue to worsen our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring further impairments which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 

 

funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for more than 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience further otherthantemporary declines in value which would adversely affect our earnings 

 

auction rate securities “ars” held by us are securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase interest rates for ars are reset through a “dutch auction” each month which prior to february 2008 had provided a liquid market for these securities 

 

substantially all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee however liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments with a par value of 733 million at april 24 2009 for each failed auction the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop 

 

as of april 24 2009 we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 88 million of which we recorded temporary impairment charges of 70 million offset by unrealized gains of 03 million and 21 million was recognized as an otherthantemporary impairment charge in addition we have classified all of our auction rate securities as longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets of april 24 2009 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain although we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity if the current market conditions deteriorate further or the anticipated recovery in market liquidity does not occur we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 

 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our sale of 1265 billion of 175 convertible senior notes in june 2008 the “notes” we have a greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past we also have a credit facility and various synthetic lease arrangements in addition subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financings agreements we may incur additional debt 

 

our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability to us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations we may need to utilize our existing line of credit to obtain the necessary funds or we may be required to raise additional funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is 

available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

 

we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 

 

our access to undrawn amounts under our credit facility and the ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants which could be more challenging in a difficult operating environment if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the facility or arrangements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts under this credit facility or repurchase the properties and facility which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements if we lose access to these credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms which could limit our operating flexibility 

 

the agreements governing our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

as a result of these restrictive covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be significantly restricted we may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 

 

we are also required to comply with financial covenants under our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements and our ability to comply with these financial covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions 

 

our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and our synthetic lease arrangements which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangement and could also result in a cross default with respect to our other indebtedness in addition our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the notes which could permit the holders to accelerate the notes if all of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 

 

future issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of the notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and the notes 

 

any new issuance of equity securities including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons including to finance our operations and business strategy including in connection with acquisitions strategic collaborations or other transactions to increase our capital to adjust our 

ratio of debt to equity to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 

 

in addition the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the notes or any common stock that holders receive upon conversion of the notes 

 

conversion of our notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes upon conversion of a note we will satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the note and shares of common stock if any to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the notes as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the number of shares delivered upon conversion if any will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

 

the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the “counterparties” which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with these hedging transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards and the diversification of counterparties the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our shareholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman otc” is the counterparty to 20 of our note hedges the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc on october 3 2008 constituted an “event of default” under the hedge transaction that could at our option lead to termination under the hedge transaction to the extent we provide notice to lehman otc we have not terminated the note hedge transaction with lehman otc and will continue to carefully monitor the developments impacting lehman otc this “event of default” is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations however we could incur significant costs if we elect to replace this hedge transaction originally held with lehman otc if we do not elect to replace this hedge transaction then we would be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the notes if on the date of conversion the pershare market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 3185 the terms of the notes the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the bankruptcy filings of lehman otc 

our synthetic leases are offbalance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and results we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure which will increase our fixed costs our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 

 

we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor “bbpplc” for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale california on april 1 2009 we terminated two of the synthetic lease arrangements in an effort to manage our capital structure in light of the current economic environment the lease payments commitments associated with the remaining arrangements as of the termination date totaled 1411 million through fiscal 2013 these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 13 “accounting for leases as amended” and are not considered variable interest entities under fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities revised” therefore we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet however if circumstances were to change regarding our or bnpplc’s ownership of the properties or in bnpplc’s overall portfolio we could be required to consolidate the entity the leased facilities and the associated debt 

 

our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs our operating results will be harmed if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc therefore if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and operating results 

 

reductions in headcount growth have resulted in excess capacity and vacant facilities in addition we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities’ operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the us during fiscal 2009 and 2008 our international revenues accounted for 485 and 471 of our total revenues respectively in addition we have several research and development centers overseas and a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us accordingly our business and our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts in addition we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets conversely lowering our price in local currency may result in lower usbased revenue a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local operating expenses additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter the timevalue component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings 

these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results our international operations are subject to other risks including general importexport restrictions and the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law 

 

moreover in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to fines and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties 

 

in order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk should there be a counterparty default we could be exposed to the net losses on the original hedge contracts or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 

 

a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances is held overseas if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and service our debt we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 

 

a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences which could adversely affect our financial results as a result unless the cash generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to expand our existing credit facility to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities develop new products respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits we have not provided for united states federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result on future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the obama administration recently announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings absent a restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality some of the future unrepatriated earnings would be taxed at the united states federal income tax rate 

 

additionally the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on may 27 2009 held in xilinx inc v commissioner that stockbased compensation must be included in the research and development cost base of companies that have entered into a cost sharing arrangement and must therefore be allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits the court’s reversal of the prior us tax court decision will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were required to be recognized under financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” we are currently evaluating the impact of the xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes 

 

our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires in 2010 if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement in recent years several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which has resulted in material proposed assessments andor pending litigation with respect to those companies during fiscal 2009 we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with federal income tax audits conducted with respect to our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax years if the ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the current irs audit or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future investments in nonmarketable securities of private companies and these investments may not achieve our objectives 

 

on occasion we make strategic investments in nonmarketable securities of development stage entities as of april 24 2009 the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled 40 million investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky and some of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on these companies’ future prospects they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments in them would likely become impaired we could lose our entire investment in these companies for example during fiscal 2009 we determined that our investments in nonmarketable securities of two companies had been impaired and we recorded impairment charges of 63 million 

 

if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement all or a portion of the revenue relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods 

 

in the course of our sales efforts we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance and storage review services if we are required to change the pricing of our software related elements through discounting or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements we may be unable to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement a delay in the recognition of revenue may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 

 

our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world any political military world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified 

engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and operating results 

 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue gross margins and operating results 

 

in addition we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages based on our historical experience we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is low however should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims our business could be adversely impacted 

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business including our ongoing litigation with sun microsystems litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable or where any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties further the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be time consuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and 

competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure more efficient including moving activities from higher to lowercost owned locations as well as outsourcing certain business process functions problems with the execution of these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

 

we continuously seek to make our cost structure more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide for example certain engineering activities and projects that were formally performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations the challenges involved with these initiatives include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures 

 

in addition we will rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain business process functions in it and accounting and as a result we may incur increased business continuity risks for example we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes including the internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business process services as anticipated we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products 

 

we continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products as a result governmental and nongovernmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions there is a risk that the rush to development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it industry or will favor certain technological approaches depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted compliance could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

 

we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april 24 2009 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 24 2009 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of 

management’s time in connection with further evaluations either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

 

because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as the increased use of fair value measures and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference 

 

overview 

 

fiscal 2009 was characterized initially by a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment with continued deterioration in global economic conditions as the year progressed customers were faced with data volumes that continued to grow and shrinking or frozen capital budgets as a result customers postponed many it projects and looked for solutions that provided a rapid return on their investment — typically less than twelve months server virtualization remained one of the most often funded it projects due to the cost savings it produces netapp has been a direct beneficiary of the trend towards server virtualization because of the unique storage efficiency features 

we provide along with our ability to virtualize the storage infrastructure with our software intensive solutions we offer customers greater functionality easier manageability and a smaller hardware footprint helping them to meet their business objectives with less physical storage and a lower total cost of ownership as a result netapp gained a significant number of new customer accounts in fiscal 2009 

 

however revenue from new accounts was not enough to offset the slowdown in spending from many of our largest accounts and our overall revenue growth slowed relative to previous years our largest accounts contributed to a significant level of hardware service contract and software entitlement and maintenance contract renewals demonstrating continued commitment to netapp technology in their data centers while at the same time delaying capital expenditures amidst an uncertain economic environment 

 

net revenues increased by 31 to 34064 million in fiscal 2009 from 33032 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as well as service revenues partially offset by decreases in product revenues and a negative impact from a gsa settlement the 1287 million gsa settlement was related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of a gsa contract between august 1997 and february 2005 

 

netapp implemented comprehensive expense reduction programs in fiscal 2009 as the global macroeconomic conditions worsened we decided to cease development and availability of our snapmirror ® for open systems “smos” product we also implemented a worldwide restructuring program which included a reduction in workforce the closing or downsizing of certain facilities and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities as a result of these programs we recognized total restructuring charges of 515 million including the severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 450 regular positions contract cancellation charges write offs of intangible and fixed assets and costs association with the closure of some of our facilities as well as 29 million of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives our actions were intended to better align our cost structure with expected revenues as well as to reallocate resources into areas of our business with more growth potential 

 

as a result of the financial crisis during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 296 million on our investments which resulted from direct and indirect exposure to lehman brothers holdings inc securities and otherthantemporary declines in the value of our auction rate securities and investments in privately held companies the volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 

 

despite the current challenging economic environment we believe there are fundamental aspects of our business that will allow us to succeed over the long term we believe that our products and services provide customers with valuable storage solutions even in a more constrained spending environment we also believe that our investments in branding awareness and new customer acquisition will lead to an increase in our market share once the economy begins to recover however continued revenue growth depends on the introduction and market acceptance of new products and solutions and continued market demand for our products we will continue our focus on expense management while improving our resource allocation to fund investment in strategic initiatives our actions are designed to preserve our revenuegenerating potential increase our focus on key growth opportunities and at the same time improve operating leverage over the long term 

 

subsequent event 

 

on may 20 2009 we entered into an agreement to acquire data domain a leading provider of storage solutions for backup and archive applications based on deduplication technology data domain deduplication storage systems are designed to deliver reliable efficient and costeffective solutions that enable enterprises of all sizes to manage retain and protect their data the agreement was subsequently amended on june 3 2009 pursuant to the terms of the definitive merger agreement relating to the merger each share of data domain common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive subject to adjustment a combination of 1645 in cash and a certain number of shares of our common stock calculated based on an exchange ratio 

the merger if completed may result in material but indeterminable increases in our revenues operating results financial position and cash flows while we anticipate cost synergies associated with combining facilities it infrastructure and certain functions such as finance human resources and administrative services with those of data domain differences between our and data domain’s operations could cause unforeseen delays in the integration process result in lower savings than originally anticipated or both which could adversely affect netapp’s business and operating results 

 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

 

we believe that the following accounting policies are “critical” as defined by the securities and exchange commission in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain we also have other important policies including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective these policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

 

we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

 

  

revenue recognition and allowances 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition sop no 972 and related interpretations to our product sales both hardware and software because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware we recognize revenue when 

 

 38 

  

  

our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance and storage review services our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues from software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from one to three years we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we typically sell technical consulting services separately from any of our other revenue elements either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining costs are accrued as the remaining undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory for arrangements with multiple elements we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements “the residual method” 

 

for our undelivered softwarerelated elements we apply the provisions of sop no 972 and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately either alone in the case of software entitlements and maintenance or as a bundled element which always includes software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware maintenance and may also include storage review services to determine the fair value of these elements we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices we believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements if vsoe cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements paragraph 12 of sop no 972 would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered 

 

for income statement presentation purposes once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance based on vsoe of its fair value with the remainder allocated to other service revenues 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods while we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and 

future allowance in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 24 2009 was 31 million compared to 24 million as of april 25 2008 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

 

identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our operating results 

 

under our accounting policy we perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required which would adversely affect our operating results in fiscal 2009 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill as of april 24 2009 our assets included 6810 million in goodwill see note 12 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements 

 

in fiscal 2009 we increased goodwill by 09 million relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed spinnaker and onaro options during fiscal 2008 we recorded goodwill of 792 million in connection with our onaro acquisition and a decrease of goodwill for 02 million in connection with the escrow received from our topio acquisition in fiscal 2007 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the united states and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” sfas no 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have provided a valuation allowance of 280 million as of april 24 2009 

compared to 286 million as of april 25 2008 on certain of our deferred tax assets the 05 million decrease in valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 was primarily related to changes in the blended state tax rates tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable pursuant to sfas no 123r we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures the tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards and their corresponding valuation allowance at april 24 2009 and april 25 2008 are 2789 million and 2451 million respectively 

 

on april 28 2007 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as a result of the implementation of fin no 48 we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in applicable tax law settlement of issues under audit and new exposures if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 

 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between foreign and us tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement recently several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor pending litigation effective september 27 2007 the irs’s large and midsized business division “lmsb” released a coordinated issues paper “cip” with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements “csas” specifically this cip provides guidance to irs personnel concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate the arm’s length charge buyin payment for internally developed preexisting as well as acquisitionrelated intangible property that is made available to a qualified csa during fiscal year 2009 we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax year tax returns we recently filed a protest with the irs in response to the notices of proposed adjustments the notices of proposed adjustments focus primarily on issues of the timing and the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded in the applicable period or subsequently reserved for our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment 

 

effective march 20 2008 the irs’s lmsb also released a cip with respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation specifically this cip provides guidance to irs personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a csa by providing that the parties to a csa will share all costs related to intangible development of the covered intangibles including but not limited to salaries bonuses and other payroll costs and benefits taxpayers should include all forms of compensation in the cost pool including those costs related to stockbased compensation on may 27 2009 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit held in xilinx inc v commissioner that stockbased compensation must be included in the research and development cost base of companies that have entered into a csa and must therefore be allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits the court’s reversal of the prior us tax court decision will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were required to be recognized under fin 48 we are evaluating the impact of the xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling 

concluded in the netherlands which expires in 2010 if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results 

 

the obama administration recently announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings absent a restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality the changes as currently proposed would result in some of the future unrepatriated earnings being taxed at the united states federal income tax rate 

 

inventory writedowns 

 

our inventory balance was 611 million as of april 24 2009 compared to 702 million as of april 25 2008 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we perform an indepth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margins in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold during the past few years our inventory reserves have been sufficient to cover excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in subsequent periods 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations which may require us to incur higher costs and adversely impact our operating results 

 

restructuring accruals 

 

in fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 544 million we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction intangibles and fixed assets writeoffs and noncancelable lease costs related to excess facilities severancerelated charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments we record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated the decision to eliminate excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated future sublease income we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises intangible asset writeoffs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of smos fixed assets writeoffs primarily consist of equipment and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture 

 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future 

 

impairment losses on investments 

 

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices liquidation values or other metrics for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly held companies is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

 

we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary as of april 24 2009 and april 25 2008 our shortterm and longterm investments in marketable securities have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value availableforsale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as shortterm investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements currently all marketable securities held by us are classified as availableforsale and our entire auction rate securities ars portfolio and our investment in the reserve primary fund “primary fund” are classified as longterm investments 

 

our ars are securities with longterm nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at the time of purchase during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we reclassified all of our investments in ars from shortterm investments to longterm investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately 70 million during fiscal 2009 partially offset by 03 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income loss during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment loss of 21 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ars related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades 

 

during fiscal 2008 and 2007 recognized gains and losses on availableforsale investments were not material management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date the fair value of our marketable securities including those included in longterm investments was 1228220 and 543226 as of april 24 2009 and april 25 2008 respectively 

 

the valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ars included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security expected cash flows discount rates credit ratings workout periods and overall capital market liquidity these assumptions assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties are difficult to predict and require significant judgment the use of different assumptions applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value there is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize the fair value of our ars could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio we will continue to monitor the fair value of our ars and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or otherthantemporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges 

 

as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers which occurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments as of april 24 2009 we have an investment in the primary fund an aaarated money market fund at the time of purchase with a par value of 609 million and an estimated fair value of 516 million which suspended redemptions in september 2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of 

investments the primary fund suspended redemptions in september 2008 and on december 3 2008 it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims as well as anticipated costs and expenses including related legal and accounting fees on february 26 2009 the primary fund announced a plan to set aside 35 billion of the fund’s remaining assets as the “special reserve” which may be increased or decreased as further information becomes available our pro rata share of the 35 billion special reserve is approximately 415 million the primary fund announced plans to continue to make periodic distributions up to the amount of the special reserve on a prorata basis the primary fund has received an sec order providing that the sec will supervise the distribution of assets from the primary fund we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund 

 

to determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments we use the most recent information available to us including new financings or estimates of current fair value as well as through traditional valuation techniques it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are otherthantemporarily impaired in the case of privatelyheld companies this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies this evaluation includes but is not limited to reviewing company cash position financing needs and prospects earnings or revenue outlook operational performance management or ownership changes and competition this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as united states publiclytraded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies if we believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value and this difference is otherthantemporary it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value the carrying value of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 40 million and 112 million as of april 24 2009 and april 25 2008 respectively during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we recorded 63 million and 16 million of impairment charges respectively for our investments in privatelyheld companies which were recorded in net gain loss on investments in our consolidated statements of operations and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be otherthantemporary 

 

fair value measurements 

 

we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 “ fair value measurements ” effective april 26 2008 for financial assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis under this standard fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date sfas no 157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 

 

the fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below 

 

  

we measure our availableforsale securities at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale securities include us treasury securities us government agency bonds corporate bonds corporate securities auction rate 

securities money market funds and certificates of deposit where possible we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as level 1 in the hierarchy when quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable varying valuation techniques are used such assets are classified as level 2 or level 3 in the hierarchy we classify items in level 2 if the investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency we classify items in level 3 if the investments are valued using a pricing model based on unobservable inputs in the market or require us to develop our own assumptions our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment 

 

we evaluate our investments for otherthantemporary impairment in accordance with guidance provided by sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and related guidance we consider and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis the significance of the loss incurred the financial condition and credit rating of the issuer and insurance guarantor the length of time the investments have been illiquid and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 

 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our availableforsale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 211 million in fiscal 2009 related to lehman brothers corporate bonds and the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments as well as an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 21 million related to the value of our ars the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments we will continue to monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r “ sharebased payment ” using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stockbased compensation expense for the future 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice “doj” and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” under which we agreed to pay the united states 1280 million plus interest of 07 million related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 in consideration for the release of netapp by the doj and gsa with respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as set forth in the settlement agreement the agreement reflects neither an admission nor denial by netapp of any of the claims alleged by the doj and represents a compromise to avoid continued litigation and associated risks netapp made the settlement payment on april 27 2009 in fiscal 2008 and 2007 we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

new accounting standards 

 

see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

discussion and analysis of results of operations 

 

net revenues  — our net revenues for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 

net revenues increased by 31 to 34064 million in fiscal 2009 from 33032 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as well as service revenues partially offset by decreases in product revenues and the negative impact from the gsa settlement 

 

net revenues increased by 178 to 33032 million in fiscal 2008 from 28043 million in fiscal 2007 our fiscal 2008 revenue growth was attributable to increased product revenues software entitlements and maintenance revenues and service 

 

sales through our indirect channels represented 690 630 and 596 of net revenues for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

during fiscal 2009 two us distributors accounted for approximately 105 and 106 of our net revenues respectively no distributor or other customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net revenues during fiscal 2008 and 2007 

 

product revenues 

 

 

 

product revenues decreased by 898 million or 40 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 unit volume increased driven by smaller low end systems partially offset by decreases in midrange and high end systems this trend is consistent with a shift in customer buying patterns towards smaller systems due to it spending constraints and difficult economic conditions in addition average selling prices declined driven by lower list prices unfavorable configuration mix consisting of hardware and software components disk capacity and disk price and higher discounting as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2009 partially offsetting these factors was an increase in revenues from addon products as customers focused more on extending the useful lives and capacity of their existing storage solutions 

 

product revenues increased by 1566 million or 75 to 22425 million in fiscal 2008 from 20859 million in fiscal 2007 unit volume increased driven by low end and midrange systems partially offset by a slight decrease in high end systems in addition average selling prices increased driven by higher list prices and favorable configuration mix partially offset by higher discounting revenue from addon products increased as customers focused on extending the capacity of their storage solutions 

 

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this wide variation in customer configurations can significantly impact revenue cost of revenue and gross margin performance price changes unit volumes and product configuration mix can also impact revenue cost of revenue and gross margin performance disks are a significant component of our storage systems industry disk pricing continues to fall every year and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain relatively constant margins on our disk drives while price per petabyte continues to decline system performance increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenue 

 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues 

 

 

 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by 1315 million or 270 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 this year over year increase in software entitlements and maintenance revenues was due 

primarily to the recognition of service contracts that were purchased or renewed in prior years and to a lesser extent service contracts entered into in fiscal 2009 

 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by 1456 million or 427 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the year over year increase was due to a larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed software entitlements and maintenance 

 

service revenues 

 

 

 

service revenues increased by 1903 million or 332 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 service revenues include service maintenance professional services and educational and training services the primary reason for the increase was increased service contract revenue related to an increase in the installed base in addition revenue from professional services increased due to increased integration consulting services provided in fiscal 2009 and improved productivity of our professional service personnel 

 

service revenues increased by 1967 million or 521 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the primary reasons for the increase were increased service contract revenue related to an increase in the installed base and the average revenue generated per installed base unit and an increase in professional services 

 

gsa settlement 

 

in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” under which we agreed to pay the united states 1280 million plus interest of 07 million related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 we have recorded the settlement as a reduction of revenues in fiscal 2009 

 

total international revenues 

 

 

 

total international revenues including us exports increased by 63 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 total international revenues including us exports increased by 239 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

cost of revenues 

 

our cost of revenue includes 1 cost of product revenue which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping our storage systems and amortization of purchased intangible assets inventory writedowns and warranty costs 2 cost of software maintenance and entitlements which includes the costs of providing software entitlements and maintenance and third party royalty costs and 3 cost of service which reflects costs associated with providing services for support center activities and global service partnership programs 

cost of product revenues 

 

 

 

cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased by 50 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit volume the increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was due to a larger decrease in average selling prices than corresponding costs primarily standard material costs across all of our systems 

 

cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased by 16 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit volume the increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was due to a lower increase in average selling prices than corresponding costs primarily related to standard material costs on new low end systems 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in cost of product revenues was 33 million 34 million and 37 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was 245 million 226 million and 176 million for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a change in the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product revenues these costs were included in cost of service revenues in previous periods our cost of product revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 reflect a reclassification of 270 million and 221 million respectively to conform to current period presentation there was no change in warranty costs as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

we expect future product gross margins to be impacted by a variety of factors including selective price reductions and discounts increased indirect channel sales higher software revenue mix and the margin profile of new products if our shipment volumes product mix average selling prices and pricing actions that impact our product gross margin continue to be adversely affected by the economic downturn or market factors our gross margin could decline 

 

cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues 

 

 

 

cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues as a percentage of software entitlements and maintenance revenue remained relatively flat at 15 in fiscal 2009 and 18 in fiscal 2008 respectively cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues as a percentage of software entitlements and maintenance revenue decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower thirdparty royalty expenses 

 

cost of service revenues 

 

 

cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 74 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 and by 70 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in service cost of revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased service infrastructure spending to support our customers which included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities for a larger installed base of product and global service partnership programs the decrease in service cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased service revenue volume and improved productivity partially offset by higher costs 

 

stockbased compensation expense of 123 million was included in the cost of service revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to 104 million and 101 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a change in the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product revenues these costs were included in cost of service revenues in previous periods our cost of product revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 reflect a reclassification of 270 million and 221 million respectively to conform to current period presentation 

 

service gross margin is also typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our installed base of product as well as the timing of support service initiations and renewals and incremental investments in our customer support infrastructure 

 

sales and marketing — sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits commissions allocated facilities and it costs advertising and promotional expenses stockbased compensation expense and travel and entertainment expenses sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1105 million or 103 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits primarily due to increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person and an increase in it expenses related to new software implementations partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses and travel and entertainment expenses 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues higher payroll expenses due to higher profitability higher partner program expenses the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions and higher stockbased compensation expenses 

 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies primarily euro british pound and australian dollar had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods our sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2009 would have been approximately 105 million higher or 09 higher the foreign currency exchange rate impact on sales and marketing expense was insignificant for fiscal 2008 and 2007 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2009 was 651 million compared to stock compensation expense of 654 million and 717 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively amortization of trademarkstrade names and customer contractsrelationships included in sales and marketing expense was 44 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 42 million and 29 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively 

research and development — research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits allocated facilities and it costs depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and prototype and engineering charges research and development expense for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

research and development expense increased by 463 million or 102 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits resulting from increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person as well as higher average headcount and an increase in facilities expenses related to new engineering labs 

 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due increased headcount ongoing operating impact of acquisitions ongoing current and future product development and enhancement efforts higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability and higher stockbased compensation expense 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in research and development expense for fiscal 2009 was 379 million compared to 466 million and 513 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively no software development costs were capitalized during any of the periods 

 

we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we expect to continuously support current and future product development broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio 

 

general and administrative — general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits professional and corporate legal fees stockbased compensation recruiting expenses and allocated facilities and it costs general and administrative expense for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

general and administrative expense increased by 322 million or 187 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to increased professional and legal fees an increase in salaries and related benefits primarily resulting from increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person and an increase in it expenses 

 

the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher payroll expenses due to higher profitability and increased headcount higher stockbased compensation expense recognized and higher legal and professional fees for general corporate matters 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2009 was 222 million compared to 221 million and 262 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

fiscal 2009 restructuring plans — in february 2009 we announced our decision to execute a worldwide restructuring program which included a reduction in workforce the closing or downsizing of certain facilities and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities in december 2008 we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of smos which was originally acquired through our acquisition of topio in fiscal 2007 as part of this decision we also announced the closure of our engineering facility in haifa israel these restructuring activities resulted in restructuring charges totaling 515 million of severancerelated amounts and other charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450 regular positions abandoned excess facilities 

charges relating to noncancelable lease costs which are net of expected sublease income contract cancellation charges outplacement expenses fixed assets and intangibles writeoffs as well as 29 million of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives in recording the facility lease restructuring reserve we made certain estimates and assumptions related to the i time period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant ii sublease terms and iii sublease rates 

 

as of april 24 2009 approximately 159 million of the costs associated with these activities were unpaid we expect that severancerelated charges and other costs will be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the facilitiesrelated lease payments to be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

 

fiscal 2002 restructuring plan — as of april 24 2009 we also have 13 million remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part of a restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments on exited facilities net of expected sublease income we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates during fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring recoveries of 01 million resulting from a change in the estimated operating expenses relating to this facility restructuring reserve we expect to substantially fulfill the remaining contractual obligations related to this facility restructuring reserve by fiscal 2011 

 

of the restructuring reserve balance at april 24 2009 147 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 25 million was classified as other longterm obligations 

 

see note 13 “restructuring and other charges” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

 

other income and expense 

 

interest income  — interest income for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower market yields on our cash and investment portfolio in part due to a shift of our portfolio to shorter term investments with lower risk this yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash and investment balances due to the issuance of the convertible notes the “note” see note 4 “convertible notes and credit facilities” of the consolidated financial statements the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash and investment balances 

 

we expect that periodtoperiod changes in interest income will continue to be impacted by the volatility of market interest rates cash and investment balances cash generated by operations timing of our stock repurchases cash used in acquisitions capital expenditures and payments of our contractual obligations 

 

interest expense  — interest expense for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on our 175 convertible senior notes the “notes” partially offset by lower interest expense related to the reduced outstanding balance on our secured credit agreement we entered into with jpmorgan in october 2007 the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to full repayment of the loan agreement entered with jpmorgan “loan agreement” partially offset by increased interest expense on the 2500 million outstanding under the revolving secured credit agreement with jpmorgan securities during fiscal 2008 

we expect periodtoperiod changes in interest expense to fluctuate based on market interest rate volatility and amounts that may be due from time to time under various outstanding debt agreements in addition upon adoption of the new fsp apb no 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion” “fsp apb no 141” we will account separately for the estimated liability and equity components of our notes as a result we will record incremental interest expense in connection with the nonconvertible debt borrowing rate in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

gain loss on investments net — 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 net loss on investments of 296 million included a net impairment loss related to our investments in privately held companies of 63 million an otherthantemporary impairment charge on our availableforsale investments related to direct and indirect investments in lehman brothers securities of 211 million and a decline in the value of our auction rate securities of 21 million 

 

net gain on sale of investments was 126 million for fiscal 2008 net gain for fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a gain of 136 million related to the sale of shares of blue coat common stock offset by a net writedown of 10 million for our investments in privatelyheld companies for fiscal 2007 net loss on sale of investments was 15 million including a net writedown of 21 million related to the impairment of our investment in privatelyheld companies 

 

other income expense net — 

 

 

 

other income expense net consists of primarily net exchange losses and gains from foreign currency transactions and related hedging activities we believe that periodtoperiod changes in foreign exchange gains or losses will continue to be impacted by hedging costs associated with our forward and option activities and forecast variance 

 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

 

 

for fiscal 2009 we applied to pretax income an effective tax rate benefit of 776 before discrete reporting items after taking into account the tax effect of federal research tax credit and other immaterial items the effective tax rate benefit for fiscal 2009 was 931 and the effective tax rate expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 191 and 172 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 which was negative and thus a benefit decreased relative to the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily due to the decrease in the us portion of our income and to the benefits generated from the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit which was part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the geographic composition of our consolidated income was impacted by losses generated in the us for restructuring charges and the gsa settlement these charges resulted in a taxable loss in the us which primarily drove the tax benefit 

 

for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we applied to pretax income an annual effective tax rate before discrete reporting items of 133 and 190 respectively the decrease in the annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to a relative increase in the benefits attributable to our foreign operations as well as to a relative decrease in the tax impact of nondeductible stockbased compensation brought about in part by 

our decision to cease granting incentive stock options since we have replaced the granting of incentive stock options with the granting of nonqualified stock options this gives rise to the recognition of more income tax benefits as stockbased compensation is recognized 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash flow on our liquidity and capital resources the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 24 2009 

 

liquidity sources cash requirements 

 

our principal sources of liquidity as of april 24 2009 consisted of 1 approximately 26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 an unsecured revolving credit facility totaling 2500 million of which 06 million has been allocated as of april 24 2009 to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs including a onetime payment of 1287 million related to our gsa settlement support ongoing business activities implement restructuring plans research and development capital expenditure needs the proposed data domain acquisition and other business acquisitions investment in critical or complementary technologies and to service our debt and synthetic leases 

 

key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability as well as our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories and whether or not we ultimately complete the merger with data domain discussed below based on our current business outlook we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions in light of the current economic and market conditions we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing if necessary on satisfactory terms if at all 

 

our investment portfolio including the primary fund and auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets in fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge to earnings of 211 million related to lehman brothers corporate bonds and the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments in addition we also recorded an otherthantemporary impairment of 21 million relating to certain auction rate securities we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund however we are not dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve months in order to meet our liquidity needs we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other potential sources of cash we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions or other cash requirements we intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers if current market conditions deteriorate further or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future quarters 

 

capital expenditure requirements 

 

we expect to fund our capital expenditures including our commitments related to facilities and equipment operating leases over the next few years through cash generated from operations existing cash cash equivalents and investments the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will 

depend on a number of factors including future demand for products product mix changes in the network storage industry economic conditions and market competition we expect that our existing facilities in sunnyvale california research triangle park north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed however if current economic conditions deteriorate further we may be required to implement additional restructuring plans to eliminate or consolidate excess facilities incur cancellation penalties and impair fixed assets 

 

acquisition related requirements 

 

on may 20 2009 we announced our entry into a definitive agreement with data domain inc to acquire such company in a merger for an aggregate merger consideration of approximately 15 billion in cash and common stock net of data domain’s cash balances on june 3 2009 we revised the terms of the definitive agreement to increase the aggregate merger consideration to 19 billion net of data domain’s cash balance if the acquisition is completed under the current terms we expect that we will have to use at least 1 billion of our cash cash equivalent and investments for cash consideration to data domain shareholders and transaction costs the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals the transaction is valued at approximately 2 billion and is expected to be completed in 60 to 120 days 

 

cash flows 

 

as of april 24 2009 compared to april 25 2008 our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 14398 million to 26042 million the increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was primarily a result of net proceeds from issuance of the notes and warrants cash provided by operating activities issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases partially offset by stock repurchases execution of the note hedge capital expenditures and repayment of the secured revolving credit facility we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital working capital increased by 11061 million to 17595 million as of april 24 2009 compared to 6533 million as of april 25 2008 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

during fiscal 2009 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 8734 million compared with 10089 million and 8645 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively we recorded net income of 865 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 3097 million and 2977 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively a summary of the significant changes in noncash adjustments affecting net income and changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows is as follows 

 

 55 

 

  

other changes in prepaid expenses other accrued liabilities income taxes payable and other liabilities balances were due to timing of payments versus recognition of assets or liabilities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity accounts receivable collections inventory and supply chain management excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were 2897 million as compared to 1883 million and 1658 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively we used 1168 million in fiscal 2009 and received 3764 million and 1879 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively for net purchases and redemptions of shortterm investments and restricted investments during fiscal 2009 we reclassified 5980 million of cash equivalents relating to the primary fund to shortterm investments in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we received 11 million 192 million and 28 million respectively from the sale of nonmarketable and marketable securities in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we also used 03 million 42 million and 16 million for purchases of nonmarketable and marketable securities in fiscal 2008 we acquired onaro inc and remitted total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling 996 million and received 02 million escrow related to our topio acquisition in fiscal 2007 we acquired topio inc and remitted total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling 1312 million in fiscal 2007 we received 239 million in cash in connection with the sale of certain assets to blue coat 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

we received 6966 million in fiscal 2009 and used 6624 million and 7473 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively from financing activities during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we made repayments of 1726 million 2315 million and 2149 million respectively in connection with our secured credit agreement and the term loan we repurchased 170 million 328 million and 226 million shares of common stock for a total of 4000 million 9037 million and 8057 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases were 910 million 1147 million and 2155 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of stockbased compensation expense recognized of 367 million 454 million and 632 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we withheld shares with an aggregate value of 51 million 60 million and 53 million respectively in connection with the vesting of certain employees’ restricted stock units for purposes of satisfying those employees’ federal state and local withholding tax obligations in addition during fiscal 2009 we issued 1265 billion of convertible notes and paid financing costs of 266 million we also received proceeds of 1631 million for sale of common stock warrants and paid 2549 million for purchase of note hedges during fiscal 2008 we borrowed 3188 million through a secured credit agreement 

 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee participation in employee stock programs and related tax benefits will vary 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

at april 24 2009 10963 million remained available for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

 

convertible notes 

 

in june 2008 we issued 1265 billion of 175 convertible senior notes due 2013 and concurrently entered into note hedges and separate warrant transactions see note 4 “convertible notes and credit facilities” of the consolidated financial statements the notes will mature on june 1 2013 unless earlier repurchased or converted as of april 24 2009 the notes have not been repurchased or converted we also have not received any shares under the note hedges or delivered cash or shares under the warrants 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of april 24 2009 we have an unsecured revolving credit facility totaling 2500 million of which 06 million has been allocated as of april 24 2009 to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit see note 4 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

this credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of april 24 2009 such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and a minimum amount of unencumbered cash and shortterm investments our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the credit facilities which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights including the right to accelerate the amounts outstanding thereunder and to terminate the facility we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants at april 24 2009 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 24 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

 

 

 

for purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable are legally binding on us and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

we have commitments related to four lease arrangements with bnpplc for approximately 564274 square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale california as of april 24 2009 we have a leasing arrangements “leasing arrangements 1” which requires us to lease a portion of our land in sunnyvale to bnpplc for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 190000 square feet of space costing up to 485 million as of april 24 2009 we also have commitments relating to financing and operating leasing arrangements with bnpplc “leasing arrangements 2 3 4” for land and approximately 374274 square feet of buildings located in sunnyvale california costing up to 1011 million under these leasing arrangements we began paying bnpplc minimum lease payments which vary based on libor plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates we will make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years we have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc upon expiration or upon any earlier termination of the lease terms we must elect one of the following options i purchase the buildings from bnpplc at cost ii if certain conditions are met arrange for the sale of the buildings by bnpplc to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts or iii pay bnpplc supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85 of the costs residual guarantee in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by bnpplc during the ensuing twoyear period the following table summarizes the costs the residual guarantee the applicable libor plus spread or fixed rate at april 24 2009 and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements 

 

 

 

all leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of april 24 2009 such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and a minimum amount of unencumbered cash and shortterm investments our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option would give bnpplc the right to among other things i terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements or ii exercise certain foreclosure remedies if we were to exercise our purchase option or be required to pay lease termination damages these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity which could constrain our operating flexibility 

we may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our operating or other objectives for example on april 1 2009 we terminated two leasing arrangement in connection with two buildings located in sunnyvale california and research triangle park north carolina and repaid 1193 million of the outstanding balance under the leasing arrangements on december 1 2008 we terminated a leasing arrangement in connection with a separate building located in sunnyvale california and repaid 81 million of the outstanding balance drawn under the construction allowance as a result of these terminations we are no longer contractually obligated to pay the lease payments for the lease periods and the residual guarantees 

 

legal contingencies 

 

on september 5 2007 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against sun microsystems on october 25 2007 sun microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction on october 29 2007 sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the northern district of california asserting additional patents against us the texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the texas lawsuit to the northern district of california on november 26 2007 on march 26 2008 sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in january 2008 the three lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase and no trial date has been set so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations in addition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement no accrual has been recorded as of april 24 2009 

 

in april 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america acting through the united states department of justice “doj” and on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” under which we agreed to pay the united states 1280 million plus interest of 07 million related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of gsa contracts between august 1997 and february 2005 

 

in addition we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of business while the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow operating results or financial condition 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

during the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries as of april 24 2009 our financial guarantees of 59 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds which were primarily related to selfinsurance 

 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency the program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes currently we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below 

 

  

as of april 24 2009 our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 3140 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the 

counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid 

 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 of fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” 

 

we have commitments related to four lease arrangements with bnpplc for approximately 564274 square feet of office space for our headquarters in sunnyvale california as further described above under “contractual obligations” 

 

we have evaluated our accounting for these leases under the provisions of fin no 46r and have determined the following 

 

  

accordingly under the provisions of fin no 46r we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnpplc lease our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of 1411 million as reported under our note 15 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

we also have operating leases for various facilities total rental expense for operating leases was 288 million for fiscal 2009 296 million for fiscal 2008 and 240 million for fiscal 2007

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

 

market risk and market interest risk 

 

investment and interest income  — as of april 24 2009 we had availableforsale investments of 12282 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale these investments consisting primarily of corporate bonds corporate securities us government agency bonds us treasuries certificates of deposit and money market funds are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 24 2009 would cause the fair value of these availableforsale investments to decline by approximately 16 million 

because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers we recorded in fiscal 2009 an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 118 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately 93 million on our investments in the reserve primary fund which also held lehman brothers investments we will continue to monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional otherthantemporary impairment charges we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund 

 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 24 2009 we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities investments of approximately 88 million of which we recorded temporary impairment charges of 70 million offset by unrealized gains of 03 million and 21 million was recognized as an otherthantemporary impairment charge the fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 

 

if current market conditions deteriorate further or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or otherthantemporary impairment charges to earnings in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures or other operating requirements see note 8 “fair value measurement” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we held at april 24 2009 

 

lease commitments  — as of april 24 2009 one of our four lease arrangements with bnpplc is based on a floating interest rate the minimum lease payments will vary based on libor plus a spread all of our leases have a term of five years and we have the option to renew these leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnpplc a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate from the level at april 24 2009 would increase our lease payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the initial fiveyear term by an immaterial amount we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases as additional cash flow generated from operations is invested at current market rates it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a significant change in market interest rate 

 

convertible notes  — in june 2008 we issued 1265 billion principal amount of 175 notes due 2013 holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock up to the principal amount of the note amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or in stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock 

our notes have fixed annual interest rates at 175 and therefore we do not have significant interest rate exposure on our notes however we are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our notes was 1265 billion excluding 222 million of deferred debt issuance costs and total estimated fair value of our convertible debt at april 24 2009 was 1143 billion the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of our 175 notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 which was 9038 

 

nonmarketable securities  — we have from time to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be successful we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such nonmarketable investments accordingly we could lose all or part of these investments if there is an adverse change in the market price of a company we invest in our investments in nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of 40 million as of april 24 2009 and 112 million as of april 25 2008 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2009 we recorded net losses of 63 million for our investments in privately held companies 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 24 2009 the timevalue component is recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

seasonality 

 

as the size of our business has grown we have begun to see a seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year in addition we also see some international seasonality as sales to european customers are historically weaker during the summer months sales to the us government tend to be seasonally stronger during our second fiscal quarter concurrent with the end of the us federal government’s fiscal year in september 

 

backlog 

 

we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenues 

manufacturing and supply chain 

 

we have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in fremont california livingston scotland shanghai china singapore tao yuan shien taiwan and schiphol airport the netherlands these operations include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we multisource wherever possible to mitigate supply risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be iso 9001 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004 and continue to be iso 14001 certified

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following 

 

 12 

 

  

in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be different from what we forecast we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 

 

we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets our financial results will be adversely impacted if revenues do not meet our expectations our operating profit may be negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time if our revenues are lower than expected our fixed expenses could adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with revenues 

 

due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

we cannot assure you that our oem relationship with ibm will generate significant revenue 

 

in april 2005 we announced a strategic partner relationship with ibm as part of the relationship we entered into an oem agreement that enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on netapp unified solutions including nearstore and the vseries systems as well as associated software offerings while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore we cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in future years in addition we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell or its release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control its pricing in the event that sales through ibm increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts our operating results and financial condition could be harmed we cannot assure you that this oem relationship will generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenue may be impacted negatively 

 

an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major third party software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors we have significant partner relationships with database business application backup management and server virtualization companies including microsoft oracle sap symantec and vmware a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing resellers and attract new resellers and that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships in addition we do not have exclusive relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as valueadded resellers systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners in fiscal 2008 our indirect channels accounted for 630 of our consolidated revenues 

 

in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and maintain or increase our revenue we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to do so we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products however because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners at the same time our indirect channel partners may offer products that are competitive to ours in addition because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing sales and support of our competitors’ products than ours if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our products we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue which would have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively or if our resellers’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us future revenue from the us government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns a decrease in government demand for our products or an adverse outcome in an ongoing investigation by the gsa and the department of justice could materially affect our growth and result in civil penalties and a loss of revenues 

 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us however government demand is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern our financial results may be harmed 

selling our products to the us government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements we received a subpoena from the office of inspector general for the general services administration “gsa” seeking various records relating to gsa contracting activity by us during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005 the subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by gsa and the department of justice regarding potential violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity the subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts we are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the department of justice on several occasions violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on it could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

macroeconomic conditions and an it spending slowdown as well as variations in our expected operating performance may continue to cause volatility in our stock price we are unable to predict changes in general economic conditions and whether or to what extent global it spending rates will be affected furthermore if there are future reductions in either domestic or international it spending rates or if it spending rates do not increase our revenues operating results and stock price may continue to be adversely affected 

 

our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 

 

our revenues are difficult to forecast we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast revenues and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into 

contracts varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in particular a slowdown in it spending weak general economic conditions or evolving technology can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as our customers’ purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled 

 

in addition we apply the provisions of statement of position 972 and related interpretations to our product sales both hardware and software because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware if we are unable to establish fair value for undelivered elements of a customer order revenue relating to the entire order may be deferred until the revenue recognition criteria for all elements of the customer order are met this could lower our net revenue in one period and increase it in future periods resulting in greater variability in net revenue and income both on a periodtoperiod basis and on an actual versus forecast basis 

 

if we are unable to successfully implement our global brand awareness campaign we may not be able to increase our customer base market share or revenue and our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

we believe that building our global brand awareness is a key factor to the long term success of our business and will be crucial in order for us to grow our customer base increase our market share and accelerate our revenue growth in order to increase this awareness we launched a new branding campaign in march 2008 which includes a new company name logo tagline and new corporate messaging we are also increasing our sales headcount in order to leverage our brand awareness campaign and build demand for our products with both new and existing customers we are currently incurring and will continue to incur significant expenses as a result of these investments if we are not successful in achieving our desired growth in revenue customers demand and market share whether on the time line we have forecasted or at all our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected furthermore new or additional product introductions may also adversely affect our sales of existing products which could also materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

 

as we enter new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities furthermore provision of greater levels of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition due to the provisions of statement of position no 972 and related interpretations 

 

our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product and service solutions and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

 

we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems and the resale market for disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk 

drives generate lower gross margin than those of our storage systems as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin may be negatively affected 

 

our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

  

changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as 

 

  

an increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hds hp ibm and sunstoragetek we also see dell inc as a competitor in the storage marketplace primarily through its business partnership with emc which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from other companies including lsi logic in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sunstoragetek our nearstore vtl appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space additionally a number of small new companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets and the nearline and nearstore vtl storage markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers and any disruption or termination of our supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products in recent years rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers which could subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 

 

our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including 

 

  

component quality risk is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers 

 

in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that are incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis or on acceptable terms we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 

 

the loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

 

we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture our products in multiple locations around the world our reliance on our third party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or bring certain manufacturing inhouse we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results to date we do not have any significant purchase commitments under our agreements with contract manufacturers 

 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or their inability to obtain raw materials suitable for our needs could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if these markets do not continue to grow at the rates we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our growth our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 

 

for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceutical and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 

 

at april 25 2008 and april 27 2007 we had 14873 million and 14307 million respectively in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in corporate bonds money market funds corporate securities municipalities and the united states government and its agencies and auction rate securities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the subprime mortgage crisis in the united states which has affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 

 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted investments are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio because we have the ability and intent to hold our availableforsale investments until maturity no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity however we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates currently we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

 

funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience an other than temporary decline in value which would adversely affect our earnings 

 

auction rate securities or ars held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase interest rates for ars are reset through a “dutch auction” each month which historically has provided a liquid market for these securities 

 

substantially all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee however liquidity 

issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments with a par value of 762 million at april 25 2008 for each failed auction the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security and the ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop 

 

we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments we recorded a temporary impairment within other accumulated comprehensive income an element of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet of approximately 35 million at april 25 2008 in addition we have classified all of our auction rate securities that were not liquidated before april 25 2008 as longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of april 25 2008 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain if liquidity issues in the global credit market continue or worsen or if we experience reduced credit quality extended illiquidity or realize reduced valuations of our ars investments we may determine that we have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value in these longterm assets which could adversely impact our financial results 

 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our sale of 1265 billion of 175 convertible senior notes in june 2008 the “notes” we have a greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past we also have two credit facilities and various synthetic lease arrangements as of april 25 2008 as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the notes as of such date we would have had approximately 1438 billion of longterm debt outstanding in addition subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financings agreements we may incur additional debt 

 

our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have important consequences because 

 

  

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding classes of debt 

 

future issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of the notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and the notes 

 

any issuance of equity securities after the notes offering including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons including to finance our operations and business strategy including in connection with acquisitions strategic collaborations or other transactions to increase our capital to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 

in addition the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading price of the notes or any common stock that holders receive upon conversion of the notes 

 

conversion of our notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their notes 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes upon conversion we will satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of a note and shares of common stock if any to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the notes as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the number of shares delivered upon conversion if any will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

 

the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the “counterparties” which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes at the same time we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price in connection with hedging these transactions the counterparties may have entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions additionally these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards and the diversification of counterparties the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

in addition if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants there could be additional dilution to our shareholders which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

our synthetic leases are offbalance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and results we are investing substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure which will increase our fixed costs our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 

 

we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation the lessor for our headquarters office buildings in sunnyvale california and a data center in research triangle park north carolina these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 13 accounting for leases as amended and are not considered variable interest entities under fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities revised” therefore we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet however if circumstances were to change regarding our or bnp’s ownership of the properties or in bnp’s overall portfolio we could be required to consolidate the entity the leased facilities and the associated debt 

if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnp therefore if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnp which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 

we have contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our facilities and data center we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will increase our fixed costs if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs our profitability will be reduced 

 

we are subject to restrictive debt covenants pursuant to our indebtedness these covenants may restrict our ability to finance our business and if we do not comply with the covenants or otherwise default under them we may not have the funds necessary to pay all amounts that could become due 

 

the agreements governing our credit facilities and synthetic lease arrangements contain and any other future debt agreement we enter into may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions 

 

as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be significantly restricted and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the notes and our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 

 

unfavorable economic and market conditions and global disruptions could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions as well as the uncertain geopolitical environment customer demand for our products is intrinsically linked to the strength of the economy a reduction in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening economic conditions and customer decreases in corporate spending deferral or delay of it projects longer time frames for it purchasing decisions and generally reduced capital expenditures for it storage solutions will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates for us the network storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the storage and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions we have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in either the us or other regions of the world continued increases in energy prices declining economic conditions and global credit and liquidity issues could also affect our future operating results if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the us for example in fiscal 2008 471 of our total revenues were from international customers including us exports in addition we have several research and development centers overseas and a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us accordingly our business and our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts in addition we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets conversely lowering our price in local currency may result in lower usbased revenue a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local operating expenses additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter the timevalue component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results our international operations are subject to other risks including general importexport restrictions and the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law 

 

a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and service our debt we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 

 

a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences which could adversely affect our financial results as a result unless the cash generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our domestic operations our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases acquisitions and other strategic opportunities and to 

service our outstanding indebtedness we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or we may need to expand our existing credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership furthermore lenders in particular in light of the current challenges in the credit markets may not agree to extend us new additional or continuing credit if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities develop new products respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness in any such case our business operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires in 2010 if we are unable to renegotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole 

 

the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement recently several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which has resulted in material proposed assessments andor pending litigation our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial 

position and our results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future acquisitions and investments in nonmarketable securities of private companies and these investments may not achieve our objectives 

 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 

 

acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value integration risks and issues may include but are not limited to key personnel retention and assimilation management distraction technical development and unexpected costs and liabilities including goodwill impairment charges in addition we may be unable to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

on occasion we invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies as of april 25 2008 the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled 112 million investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky and some of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on these companies’ future prospects they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments in them would likely become impaired 

 

if we fail to manage our expanding business effectively our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future operating results depend to a large extent on management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth including but not limited to expanding international operations forecasting revenues addressing new markets controlling expenses implementing and enhancing infrastructure investing in people facilities and capital equipment and managing our assets an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

in addition continued expansion could strain our current management financial manufacturing and other existing systems and may require us to improve those existing systems or implement new ones if we experience any problems with the improvement or expansion of these systems procedures or controls or if these systems procedures or controls are not designed implemented or improved in a costeffective and timely manner our operations may be materially and adversely affected in addition any failure to implement improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

as we continue to grow our business we are likely to incur costs earlier than some of the anticipated benefits which could harm our operating results a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed which could materially and adversely affect our net income 

 

we are increasing our investment in engineering sales service support and other functions to grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be affected in a material and adverse manner 

 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

 

any political military world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

 

in addition we may be subject to losses that may result or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages based on our historical experience we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low however should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims our business could be adversely impacted 

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business including our ongoing litigation with sun microsystems litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and our existing and future patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business in addition a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 

 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be time consuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the network storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

 

we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april 25 2008 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 25 2008 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 

 

because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by 

regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

 

our ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new and existing accounting requirements such as sfas no 123r 

 

the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other sharebased payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of income option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate we have chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to purchase our common stock as permitted by sab no 107 management applies judgment when determining estimated forfeiture rates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and as a result could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations given the unpredictable nature of the “black scholes” variables and other management assumptions such as number of options to be granted underlying strike price and associated income tax impacts it is very difficult to forecast stockbased compensation expense for any given quarter or year any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact our ability to make accurate forecasts of future earnings and volatility of our stock price if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated securities class action litigation could be brought against us or the market price of our common stock could decline or both could occur as a result we could incur significant losses and our operating results may be adversely affected

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

on september 5 2007 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against sun microsystems “sun” on october 25 2007 sun filed a counter claim against us in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction on october 29 2007 sun filed another lawsuit against us in the northern district of california asserting additional patents against us the texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the texas lawsuit to the northern 

district of california on november 26 2007 on march 26 2008 sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in january 2008 we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations in addition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement no accrual has been recorded as of april 25 2008 

 

we received a subpoena from the office of inspector general for the general services administration “gsa” seeking various records relating to gsa contracting activity by us during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005 the subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by gsa and the department of justice regarding potential violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity the subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts we are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the department of justice on several occasions violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however as the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of this matter no provision has been recorded as of april 25 2008

overview 

 

enterprises are generating large quantities of data we are experiencing a worldwide proliferation of data driven by the rapid growth of broadband internet access the proliferation of data devices exponential growth of digital information and the need to protect critical data through replication significant data growth tough economic conditions physical data center limitations including power heat space and new agile software development methodologies continue to stress enterprise storage infrastructure greater global demands on data access more complex legal requirements increasing consequences for data outages and the need for greater data longevity all contribute to the growing burden on it professionals as the volume of data grows so does the complexity of data storage and management data ownership and the burdens of managing data continue to challenge our enterprise customers 

 

in response enterprises are looking for solutions to help simplify data storage and it administration improve the capabilities of storage systems and reduce total costs of ownership companies are migrating toward modular unified storage systems and away from large fixed expensive frameclass arrays and inefficient directattached storage to maximize infrastructure efficiency multiple dedicated servers can now be replaced by virtual servers sharing networkbased resources such as common storage there is a growing trend toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage pool 

during fiscal 2008 we continued to help customers transform their data center architectures through higher efficiencies and asset utilization greater power and space savings and innovative data center design and data management techniques we also continued to make progress across many areas of the organization including broadening and enhancing our enterprise solutions supporting our channel and partners and deepening our professional services coverage we strengthened our strategic partnerships with server virtualization partners and leveraged our storage grid architecture to enable customers to scale their server and storage infrastructures reduce costs maximize asset utilization and keep data highly available in march 2008 we launched a global branding and awareness campaign to increase the visibility of netapp in the broader it market we believe that building our global brand awareness is a key factor to the long term success of our business in order to grow our customer base increase our market share and accelerate our revenue growth the onaro acquisition completed on january 28 2008 expanded our heterogeneous storage infrastructure and strengthened our storage and data management software portfolio by providing customers with new storage service management and change management capabilities in addition with our product introductions we further extended our ability to help customers do “more with less” 

 

our fiscal 2008 revenue growth was driven by continued demand across the world for our solutions particularly in international markets and increased revenue from our us commercial enterprise and us federal business partially offset by continued softness in our top enterprise accounts revenue growth was attributable to increased product revenue with an expanded portfolio of new products and solutions for enterprise customers increased software entitlements and maintenance revenue and increased service revenue and was partially offset by lowercostpermegabyte disks and lower average selling prices of our older generation products we believe our products continue to offer the best priceperformance value in the industry 

 

while we reported solid results for fiscal 2008 we were not immune to macroeconomic conditions we believe that our storage solutions provide customers with value propositions that will enable us to continue to gain market share in a more constrained spending environment our strategic investments are targeted at some of the strongest areas of the storage market such as modular storage archive and compliance data protection data management data permanence data security and privacy iscsi and grid computing we believe that we are well positioned in the fastest growth segments of the storage market to capitalize on an it spending recovery however if any storage market trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated and if there is reduced or no demand for our products our expected rate of revenue growth could be materially impacted continued revenue growth depends on the introduction and market acceptance of new products and solutions and continued market demand for our products we will continue to invest in the people processes and systems necessary to best optimize our revenue growth and longterm profitability however we cannot assure you that such investments will result in achieving our financial objectives 

 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

 

we believe that the following accounting policies are “critical” as defined by the securities and exchange commission in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain we also have other important policies including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective these policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

 

  

revenue recognition and allowances 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition sop no 972 and related interpretations to our product sales both hardware and software because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware we recognize revenue when 

 

  

our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance and storage review services our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues from software entitlements and maintenance premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from one to three years standard hardware warranty costs are considered an obligation under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies and expensed as a cost of service when revenue is recognized such costs were 270 million in fiscal 2008 221 million in fiscal 2007 and 185 million in fiscal 2006 we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we typically sell technical consulting services separately from any of our other revenue elements either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the time of 

delivery and any remaining costs are accrued as the remaining undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory for arrangements with multiple elements we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements “the residual method” 

 

for our undelivered softwarerelated elements we apply the provisions of sop no 972 and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately either alone in the case of software entitlements and maintenance or as a bundled element which always includes software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware maintenance and may also include storage review services to determine the fair value of these elements we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices we believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements if vsoe cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements paragraph 12 of sop no 972 would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered 

 

for income statement presentation purposes once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance based on vsoe of its fair value with the remainder allocated to other service revenues 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods while we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 25 2008 was 24 million compared to 26 million as of april 27 2007 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

 

identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets in addition a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our gross and operating margins we currently do not foresee changes to useful lives or writedowns to these assets 

 

under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse 

industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required in fiscal 2008 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment however any future writedowns of goodwill would adversely affect our operating margins as of april 25 2008 our assets included 6801 million in goodwill see note 14 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during fiscal 2008 we recorded goodwill of 792 million in connection with our onaro acquisition and a decrease of goodwill for 02 million in connection with the escrow received from our topio acquisition in fiscal 2007 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the united states and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” sfas no 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have provided a valuation allowance of 286 million as of april 25 2008 compared to 210 million as of april 27 2007 on certain of our deferred tax assets we adopted sfas no 123r effective the beginning of our fiscal year ended april 27 2007 under sfas no 123r tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options should not be realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable pursuant to footnote 82 of sfas no 123r on a prospective basis we no longer include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures the tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards and their corresponding valuation allowance excluded under footnote 82 for the years ended april 25 2008 and april 27 2007 are 2451 million and 3633 million respectively 

 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between foreign and us tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement recently several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations which have resulted in material proposed assessments andor pending litigation effective september 27 2007 the irs’s large and midsized business division “lmsb” released a coordinated issues paper “cip” with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements “csas” specifically this cip provides guidance to irs personnel concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate the arm’s length charge buyin payment for internally developed preexisting as well as acquisitionrelated intangible property that is made available to a qualified csa we have evaluated the irs’s positions in this cip and have concluded that it will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows furthermore our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows however if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of 

our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our overall effective tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment 

 

effective march 20 2008 the irs’s lmsb also released a cip with respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation specifically this cip provides guidance to irs personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a csa by providing that the parties to a csa will share all costs related to intangible development of the covered intangibles including but not limited to salaries bonuses and other payroll costs and benefits taxpayers should include all forms of compensation in the cost pool including those costs related to stockbased compensation we have evaluated the irs’s positions in this cip and have concluded that it will not have a material adverse impact upon our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows 

 

on april 28 2007 we adopted fin no 48 fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as a result of the implementation of fin no 48 we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in applicable tax law settlement of issues under audit and new exposures if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 

 

inventory writedowns 

 

our inventory balance was 702 million as of april 25 2008 compared to 549 million as of april 27 2007 inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or market we perform an indepth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margins in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold during the past few years our inventory reserves have generally been sufficient to cover excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in subsequent periods 

 

we engage in extensive ongoing product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our environmental compliance and could incur higher costs including additional reserves for excess component inventory 

 

restructuring accruals 

 

in fiscal 2002 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to our sunnyvale headquarters in fiscal 2006 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the move of our global service center operations in determining restructuring charges we analyze our 

future business requirements in order to properly align and manage our business commensurate with our future revenue levels 

 

our restructuring costs and any resulting accruals involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made some of which may be provided by third parties in recording severance reserves we accrue a liability when the following conditions have been met employees’ rights to receive compensation are attributable to employees’ services already rendered the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate payment of the compensation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in recording the facilities lease restructuring reserve we make various assumptions including the time period over which the facilities are expected to be vacant expected sublease terms expected sublease rates anticipated future operating expenses and expected future use of the facilities 

 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring and lease loss accruals in the future we estimated our facility restructuring reserve to be 19 million as of april 25 2008 in fiscal 2008 we recorded charges of 04 million to the restructuring reserve resulting from a change in estimated operating expenses and rent escalations in fiscal 2006 our facility restructuring reserve included a 13 million reduction related to the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility net of related costs

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we would reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices liquidation values or other metrics for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our investments in these companies are below their cost basis and are judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly held companies is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

 

we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we have not experienced any material losses on our availableforsale investments to the extent we determine that a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary the associated investment is valued at current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 

 

as of april 25 2008 and april 27 2007 our shortterm investments have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value currently all marketable securities held by us are classified as availableforsale and our entire auction rate securities ars portfolio is classified as longterm investments the ars held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities which in accordance with investment policy guidelines had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase substantially all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments we recorded a temporary impairment within other accumulated comprehensive income an element of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet of approximately 35 million at april 25 2008 

the valuation models used to estimate the auction rate securities fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security expected cash flows discount rates credit ratings workout periods and overall capital market liquidity these assumptions assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties are difficult to predict and require significant judgment the use of different assumptions applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value there is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize the fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets if these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades we may incur additional temporary impairment on our auction rate securities portfolio we will continue to monitor the fair value of our auction rate securities and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or otherthantemporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges 

 

for nonmarketable securities the impairment analysis requires the identification of events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment including revenue and earnings trends overall business prospects limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities and general market conditions in the investees’ industries the carrying value of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 112 million and 89 million as of april 25 2008 and april 27 2007 respectively during fiscal 2008 we recorded an impairment of 16 million for investments in privatelyheld companies which was recorded in net gain loss on investments in our consolidated statements of income 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment  using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stockbased compensation expense for the future 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new final staff position “fsp” no apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements” under the final fsp cash settled convertible securities would be separated into their debt and equity components the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value as of the issuance date of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability would be recorded as additional paidin capital as a result the debt would be recorded at a discount reflecting its belowmarket coupon interest rate the debt would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement this change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of cash settled convertible securities the final fsp requires explicit disclosure requirements and will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years this final fsp is to be applied 

retrospectively to all periods presented this standard will have an effect on the company’s convertible debenture sold in june 2008 as described in note 17 subsequent events 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” sfas no 161 sfas no 161 requires additional disclosures about the objectives of using derivative instruments the method by which the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 133 and its related interpretations and the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 also requires disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format this statement is effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we are currently evaluating the effect if any that the adoption of sfas no 161 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value sfas no 141r determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we are required to adopt sfas no 141r at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 which begins on april 25 2009 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 141r will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 sfas no 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity this new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders we are required to adopt sfas no 160 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 which begins on april 25 2009 we are currently evaluating the effect if any that the adoption of sfas no 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

effective april 28 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 fin no 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction fin no 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax positions for taxes accounted for under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and substantially changes the applicable accounting model there was no cumulative effect from the adoption of fin no 48 as a result of the implementation of fin no 48 we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis see “note 8 income taxes” for further discussion 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” sfas no 159 allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities that are not otherwise measured at fair value if the fair value option for an eligible item is elected unrealized gains and losses for that item shall be reported in current earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between the different measurement attributes the company elects for similar types of assets and liabilities we are required to adopt sfas no 159 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 which began on april 26 2008 the adoption of sfas no 159 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and 

expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 affects other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements where the fasb has previously concluded that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may change current practice in some instances sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we will adopt sfas no 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” “fsp 1572” fsp 1572 permits a oneyear deferral in applying the measurement provisions of sfas 157 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity’s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the adoption of sfas no 157 and fsp 1572 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

total revenues  — total revenues increased by 178 to 33032 million in fiscal 2008 from 28043 million in fiscal 2007 our fiscal 2008 revenue growth was attributable to increased product revenues software entitlements and maintenance revenues and service revenues and was partially offset by reduced revenues from older generation products sales through our indirect channels including resellers distributors and oem partners represented 630 and 596 of total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

product revenues  — product revenues increased by 1566 million or 75 to 22425 million in fiscal 2008 from 20859 million in fiscal 2007 the increase was comprised of a net 1512 million increase in unit volume and 54 million in price and product configuration 

 

revenues from our expanded portfolio of new products for enterprise customers products we began shipping in the last twelve months increased 2679 million while revenues from our existing products rose 6579 million increased revenues from new products included our fas 2000 entrylevel systems and recent product introductions in our fas 6000 series highend enterprise storage systems increased revenues from existing products were primarily from our fas 3000 midrange products 

 

these increases were partially offset by a 7692 million decrease in shipments of our older generation products older or endoflife products with declining year over year revenue as well as products we no longer ship including older generation fas 3000 systems as well as our fas 900 series systems and nearstore ® r200 systems 

 

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve this wide variation in customized configuration can significantly impact revenue cost of revenue and gross margin performance price changes volumes and product model mix can also impact revenue cost of revenue and gross margin performance disks are a significant component of our storage systems industry disk pricing continues to fall every year and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain relatively constant margins on our disk drives while price per petabyte continues to decline system performance and increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenue 

 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues  — software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by 427 to 4869 million in fiscal 2008 from 3413 million in fiscal 2007 the year over year increase was due to a larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed software entitlements and maintenance software entitlements and maintenance revenues represented 147 and 122 of total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 521 to 5738 million in fiscal 2008 from 3771 million in fiscal 2007 

 

professional service revenue increased by 588 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was due to higher customer demand for our professional services in connection with the integration of our solutions into their it environments service maintenance revenue increased by 512 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to an installed base which has grown over time as a result of new customer support contracts and renewals from existing customers 

 

while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solutions we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2009 or beyond 

 

a large portion of our service revenues are deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation period which is typically one to three years service revenues represented 174 and 134 of total revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

total international revenues  — total international revenues including us exports increased by 239 in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 total international revenues were 15543 million or 471 of total revenues for fiscal 2008 compared to 12540 million or 447 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 the year over year increase was driven by the product software entitlement and maintenance and service revenue factors outlined above we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2009 or beyond 

product gross margin  — product gross margin decreased to 594 in fiscal 2008 from 609 in fiscal 2007 

 

product gross margin was negatively impacted by rebates and initiatives taken throughout the year and directed primarily to various indirect channels we expect future product gross margin may continue to be impacted by a variety of factors including selective price reductions and discounts increased indirect channel sales increases in software revenues and new higher margin products 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in cost of product revenues was 34 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 37 million in fiscal 2007 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was 226 million and 176 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of product revenues will be 263 million for fiscal year 2009 218 million for fiscal year 2010 122 million for fiscal year 2011 59 million for fiscal year 2012 44 million for fiscal year 2013 and none thereafter 

 

software entitlements and maintenance gross margin  — software entitlements and maintenance gross margin increased to 982 for fiscal 2008 from 970 for fiscal 2007 the improved software entitlements and maintenance gross margin year over year was due to larger installed base renewals and upgrades 

 

service gross margin  — service gross margin increased to 356 in fiscal 2008 compared to 274 in fiscal 2007 cost of service revenue increased by 351 to 3698 million in fiscal 2008 from 2736 million in fiscal 2007 stockbased compensation expense of 104 million and 101 million was included in the cost of service revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

the improvement in service gross margins year over year was primarily due to an increase in service revenue volume and improved productivity partially offset by increased service infrastructure spending to support our customers this spending included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs service gross margins will typically be impacted by factors such as timing of technical support service initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure for fiscal 2009 we expect service margins to experience some variability as we continue to build out our service capability and capacity to support our growing customer base and new products 

 

sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses stockbased compensation expense and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expense increased 201 to 10756 million in fiscal 2008 from 8958 million in fiscal 2007 this expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 326 in fiscal 2008 from 320 in fiscal 2007 the increase in sales and marketing expense was due to increased commission expense resulting from higher revenues higher headcount higher branding campaign costs and the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations 

 

stock compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2008 was 654 million compared to 717 million in fiscal 2007 amortization of trademarkstrade names and customer contractsrelationships included in sales and marketing expense was 42 million and 29 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively based on identified intangibles related to our acquisitions recorded at april 25 2008 estimated future amortization such as trademarks and customer relationships included in sales and marketing expense will be 49 million for fiscal 2009 48 million for fiscal 2010 38 million for fiscal 2011 26 million for fiscal 2012 14 million for fiscal 2013 and 13 million thereafter 

 

we expect to continue to add sales capacity in an effort to expand our penetration of domestic and international markets and establish and expand our distribution channels we expect to increase sales and marketing expense to support our future revenue growth we believe that our sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009 due to increased headcount sales and marketing related programs to support future revenue growth higher branding campaign costs and real estate lease payments partially offset by reduced discretionary spending 

 

research and development  — research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits stockbased compensation prototype expenses engineering charges consulting fees and amortization of capitalized patents 

research and development expense increased 173 to 4522 million in fiscal 2008 from 3854 million in fiscal 2007 this expense as a percentage of revenue was 137 in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 the increase in research and development expense was primarily a result of increased headcountrelated salaries and incentive compensation and future product development for both fiscal 2008 and 2007 no software development costs were capitalized 

 

stock compensation expense included in research and development expense for fiscal 2008 was 466 million compared to 513 million in fiscal 2007 also included in research and development expense is capitalized patents amortization of 20 million in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 based on capitalized patents recorded at april 25 2008 estimated future capitalized patent amortization expenses will be 05 million for fiscal year 2009 01 million in fiscal 2010 and none thereafter 

 

we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we expect to continuously support current and future product development broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio 

 

we believe that our research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009 primarily due to costs associated with the development of new products and technologies headcount growth and real estate lease payments 

 

general and administrative  — general and administrative expense increased 163 to 1715 million for fiscal 2008 from 1475 million for fiscal 2007 this expense as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 52 for fiscal 2008 from 53 for fiscal 2007 the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased headcount and associated payroll expenses higher expenses related to prior acquisitions and increased professional and legal fees for general corporate matters 

 

we believe that our general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009 due to spending required to support and enhance our existing infrastructure as well as real estate lease payments partially offset by reduced discretionary spending stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 221 million and 262 million respectively amortization of covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expense was 02 million and 10 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to our sunnyvale headquarters in fiscal 2006 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the move of our global service center operations from sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our research triangle park facility in north carolina 

 

our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in previous management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in fiscal 2008 we recorded charges of 04 million to the restructuring reserve resulting from a change in the estimated operating expenses and rent escalations related to our 2002 restructuring plan 

 

of the reserve balance at april 25 2008 06 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 13 million was classified as longterm obligations the balance of the reserve relates to facilities and is expected to be paid by fiscal 2011 

the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 25 2008 in thousands 

 

 

 

gain on sale of assets  — we recorded a gain of 253 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of certain assets to blue coat systems inc “blue coat” 

 

operating income  — operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 94 for fiscal 2008 from 107 for fiscal 2007 operating income for fiscal 2007 included a gain on sale of assets of 253 million our operating expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue growth and a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce within a short period of time as a result if revenue levels are below expectations our fixed expenses could adversely affect our operating income and cash flow until revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with revenues we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues for fiscal 2009 or beyond 

 

interest income  — interest income was 646 million and 688 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the slight decrease in interest income was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash and investment balances we expect that periodtoperiod changes in interest income will continue to be impacted by the volatility of market interest rates cash and investment balances cash generated by operations timing of our stock repurchases capital expenditures and payments of our contractual obligations 

 

interest expense  — interest expense was 80 million and 116 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2008 was due to full repayment of the loan agreement entered with jpmorgan “loan agreement” partially offset by increased interest expense on the 2500 million outstanding under the revolving secured credit agreement with jpmorgan securities see note 6 we expect periodtoperiod changes in interest expense to continue to be subject to market interest rate volatility and amounts due under various loan agreements 

 

net gain loss on investments  — net gain on sale of investments was 126 million for fiscal 2008 net gain for fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a gain of 136 million related to the sale of shares of blue coat common stock offset by a net writedown of 10 million for our investments in privatelyheld companies for fiscal 2007 net loss on sale of investments was 15 million including a net writedown of 21 million related to the impairment of our investment in privatelyheld companies 

 

other income expense net  — other expense was 01 million for fiscal 2008 and consisted of net exchange losses from foreign currency of 07 million partially offset by other income of 06 million other income was 28 million for fiscal 2007 and consisted of net exchange gains from foreign currency of 24 million and other income of 04 million we believe that periodtoperiod changes in foreign exchange gains or losses will continue to be impacted by hedging costs associated with our forward and option activities and forecast variance 

provision for income taxes  — for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we applied to pretax income an annual effective tax rate before discrete reporting items of 133 and 190 respectively the decrease to the annual effective tax rate year over year is primarily attributable to a relative increase in the benefits attributable to our foreign operations as well as to a relative decrease in the tax impact of nondeductible stock compensation under sfas no 123r brought about in part by our decision to cease granting incentive stock options since we have replaced the granting of incentive stock options with the granting of nonqualified stock options this gives rise to the recognition of more deferred tax assets as sfas no 123r expense occurs after taking into account the tax effect of discrete items reported the effective tax rates applied to the pretax income for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 191 and 172 respectively 

 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

total revenues  — total revenues increased by 357 to 28043 million in fiscal 2007 from 20665 million in fiscal 2006 our fiscal 2007 revenue growth was attributable to increased product revenues software entitlements and maintenance revenues and service revenues and was partially offset by reduced revenues from older generation products sales through our indirect channels which include resellers distributors and oem partners represented 596 and 555 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

product revenues  — product revenues increased by 322 to 20859 million in fiscal 2007 from 15774 million in fiscal 2006 product revenue increased 6869 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to a 6697 million increase in unit volume and an increase of 172 million due to price and configuration on our existing products as well as increased revenues from existing products increased revenues from our new products include certain fas 3000 midrange products vseries systems nearstore virtual tape library systems and datafort storage security appliances increased revenue from existing products included certain fas 6000 series highend enterprise storage systems and certain fas 3000 products 

 

these increases were partially offset by a 3763 million decrease in shipments of our older generation products ie older or endoflife products with declining year over year revenue as well as products we no longer ship including fas 900 series systems nearstore ® r200 systems and netcache products we no longer ship 

 

software entitlements and maintenance revenues  — software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by 427 to 3413 million in fiscal 2007 from 2391 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed software entitlements and maintenance contracts software entitlements and maintenance revenues represented 122 and 116 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 509 to 3771 million in fiscal 2007 from 2499 million in fiscal 2006

a large portion of our service revenues are deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years service revenues represented 134 and 121 of total revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

total international revenues  — total international revenues including us exports increased by 329 in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 total international revenues were 12540 million or 447 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to 9438 million or 457 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 

 

product gross margin  — product gross margin was 609 for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

product gross margin for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 were affected by the following factors 

 

 46 

 

  

stockbased compensation expense included in cost of product revenues was 37 million for fiscal 2007 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was 176 million and 118 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

software entitlements and maintenance gross margin  — software entitlements and maintenance gross margin was 970 and 965 for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively due primarily to improved productivity and a larger installed base renewals upgrades and an increasing mix of enterprise customers

the stockbased compensation expense included in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2007 was 262 million compared to 10 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due to adoption of sfas no 123r amortization of covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expenses was 10 million and 22 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters in fiscal 2006 we implemented a restructuring plan related to the move of our global services center operations from sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our research triangle park facility in north carolina 

 

in fiscal 2007 we did not record any reduction in restructuring reserve resulting from a change in estimate for our restructuring plans in fiscal 2006 we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of 13 million resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility in fiscal 2006 we also recorded a restructuring charge of 11 million primarily attributed to severancerelated amounts and relocation expenses related to our 2006 restructuring plan of the reserve balance at april 27 2007 05 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 16 million was classified as longterm obligations 

 

gain on sale of assets  — we recorded a gain of 253 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of certain assets of our netcache product line to blue coat we recorded revenues of 574 million 711 million and 755 million from netcache products for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the contribution to operating income from these products was not significant 

 

interest income  — interest income was 688 million and 415 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher average interest rates on our investment portfolio

provision for income taxes  — for fiscal 2007 our annual effective tax rate was 172 versus 239 for fiscal 2006 which included a 64 increase to account for the income tax provision of 225 million associated with the cash repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings the decrease to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of this onetime item and the impact of income taxed at lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the rate derived from a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our principal european subsidiary the availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions offset partially by an increase in the rate due to the tax effect of stock compensation under sfas no 123r 

 

the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an income tax provision of 225 million or 006 per share associated with the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings this tax raised our 2006 effective tax rate by 64 under the onetime incentive created pursuant to section 965 of the jobs act we will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan that conforms to the jobs act guidelines 

 

the 2006 tax relief and health care act was signed into law on december 20 2006 one of the provisions of this law was the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit from january 1 2006 and its 

extension through december 31 2007 the effective tax rates for the fiscal 2007 reflected the benefits attributable to the extension of the research and development tax credit provisions 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations and other commercial commitments stock repurchase program capital commitments and other sources and uses of cash flow on our liquidity and capital resources 

 

balance sheet and other cash flows 

 

as of april 25 2008 as compared to april 27 2007 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased by 1444 million to 11644 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital working capital current assets minus current liabilities decreased by 3999 million to 6533 million as of april 25 2008 compared to 10533 million as of april 27 2007 due to higher stock repurchase activities in fiscal 2008 in addition we have classified all of our auction rate securities that were not liquidated before april 25 2008 from shortterm investments to longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of april 25 2008 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain 

 

during fiscal 2008 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 10089 million as compared with 8645 million and 5543 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively we reported net income of 3097 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to 2977 million and 2665 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively a summary of the significant changes and noncash adjustments affecting net income and changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows are as follows 

 

 49 

 

  

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment levels and linearity accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were 1883 million as compared to 1658 million and 1329 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively we received net proceeds of 3764 million and 1879 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively and used net proceeds of 1285 million in fiscal 2006 for net purchases and redemptions of shortterm investments and restricted investments to repay debts with jp morgan see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements investing activities in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 also included new investments in privately held companies of 42 million 16 million and 93 million respectively in fiscal 2008 we acquired onaro inc and incurred total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling 996 million in fiscal 2007 we acquired topio inc and incurred total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling 1312 million in fiscal 2006 we acquired alacritus inc “alacritus” and decru inc “decru” and incurred total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling 537 million in fiscal 2008 we received 02 million in connection with the escrow from our topio acquisition in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we received 09 million 28 million and 01 million respectively from the sale of investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2008 we received 183 million from the sale of shares of blue coat common stock in fiscal 2007 we received 239 million in cash in connection with the sale of certain assets to blue coat 

 

the credit markets have been volatile and have experienced a shortage in overall liquidity as of april 25 2008 auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 727 million were recorded in longterm investments we concluded that no otherthantemporary impairment losses occurred during fiscal 2008 because we believe that the declines in fair value that occurred during fiscal 2008 were due to general market conditions these investments continue to be of high credit quality and we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs we believe we have sufficient liquidity through cash provided by operations and our financing agreements if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

in fiscal 2008 and 2007 we used 6624 million and 7473 million respectively compared to fiscal 2006 when cash from financing activities generated 428 million we made repayments of 2315 million and 2149 million for our debt and revolving credit facility in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively we repurchased 328 million 226 million and 174 million shares of common stock for a total of 9037 million 8057 million and 4889 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively sales of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases provided 1147 million 2155 million and 2327 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the stockbased compensation expense recognized of 454 million and 632 million were presented as financing cash flows for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively in accordance with sfas no 123r during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we withheld shares with an aggregate value of 60 million 53 million and 11 million respectively in connection with the exercise of certain employees’ restricted stock for purposes of satisfying those employees’ federal state and local withholding tax obligations the increase in the amounts withheld year over year was due to the release of restricted stock units assumed in connection with acquisitions and increased grants of restricted stock units during fiscal 2008 we borrowed 3188 million through a revolving credit facility for our general corporate purposes including stock repurchases and working capital needs during fiscal 2006 we borrowed 3000 million to fund the repatriation in cash from foreign earnings and investments under the jobs act 

 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary income tax benefits associated with dispositions of employee stock transactions has historically been another significant source of our liquidity if stock option exercise patterns change we may receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not receive the same level of tax benefits in the future which could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase in addition if our stock price declines we may receive less tax benefits which could also cause our income tax payments to increase 

 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 the income tax benefit associated with dispositions of employee stock transactions was 482 million 1750 million and 366 million respectively if stock option exercise patterns change we may receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not receive the same level of tax benefits in the future which could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

at april 25 2008 4962 million remained available for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time

in march 2006 we received proceeds from a term loan agreement totaling 3000 million to finance a dividend under the jobs act “loan agreement” see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements as of april 25 2008 the loan agreement was fully repaid

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations at april 25 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

 

for purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable are legally binding on us and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table

legal contingencies 

 

on september 5 2007 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against sun microsystems on october 25 2007 sun microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the eastern district of texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction on october 29 2007 sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the northern district of california asserting additional patents against us the texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the texas lawsuit to the northern district of california on november 26 2007 on march 26 2008 sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in january 2008 we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations in addition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement no accrual has been recorded as of april 25 2008 

 

we received a subpoena from the office of inspector general for the general services administration “gsa” seeking various records relating to gsa contracting activity by us during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005 the subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by gsa and the department of justice regarding potential violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity the subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts we are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the department of justice on several occasions violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however as the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of this matter no provision has been recorded as of april 25 2008 

 

in addition we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of business while the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow operating results or financial condition 

 

capital expenditure requirements 

 

we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future consistent with the growth in our business as we continue to invest in people land buildings capital equipment and enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california research triangle park north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed we expect to finance these construction projects including our commitments under facilities and equipment operating leases and any required capital expenditures over the next few years through cash from operations and existing cash cash equivalents and investments 

 

credit environment 

 

the credit markets have been volatile and have experienced a shortage in overall liquidity we believe we have sufficient liquidity through cash provided by operations and our financing agreements if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments 

have experienced otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results in addition some of our sales are derived from customers in the financial services industry which is experiencing a downturn we believe that our diversified customer base should mitigate our exposure to any one industry however we remain exposed to overall reductions in spending by our customer base 

 

see further discussion under item 1a — risk factors “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates” 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of april 25 2008 our financial guarantees of 32 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program and foreign rent guarantees 

 

as of april 25 2008 our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 4193 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid 

 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 of fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” 

 

we have commitments related to five lease arrangements with bnp for approximately 1063971 square feet of office space and a parking structure for our headquarters in sunnyvale california and a data center in research triangle park north carolina as further described above under “contractual obligations” 

 

we have evaluated our accounting for these leases under the provisions of fin no 46r and have determined the following 

 

  

accordingly under the current fin no 46r standard we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnp lease our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estates leases will amount to a total of 3262 million reported under our note 4 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

 

key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories and future demand for our products and related pricing we expect to incur 

higher capital expenditures in the future to expand our operations we will from time to time acquire products and businesses complementary to our business in the future we may continue to repurchase our common stock which would reduce cash cash equivalents andor shortterm investments available to fund future operations and meet other liquidity requirements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and credit facilities will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases contractual obligations and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next twelve months however should we need to investigate other financing alternatives we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

 

market risk and market interest risk 

 

investment and interest income  — as of april 25 2008 we had availableforsale investments of 5432 million which included restricted investments in connection with our credit facility our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale these investments consisting primarily of corporate bonds corporate securities government municipal debt securities and auctionrate securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 25 2008 would cause the fair value of these availableforsale investments to decline by approximately 21 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

we are also exposed to market risk relating to our longterm investments in auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets as of april 25 2008 our long term investments of 839 million include fair value of auction rate securities ars in the amount of 727 million during fiscal 2008 we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately 35 million and recorded a temporary impairment charge the fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets while these ars had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase these securitiesissuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in additional decline in estimated fair value of our auction rate securities changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value if the current market conditions deteriorate further or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or impairment charges to earnings in future quarters we intend and have the ability to hold these auction rate securities until the market recovers we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our ars investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs capital expenditures or other operating requirements 

 

our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we actively review along with our investment advisors current investment ratings company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is otherthantemporary we have not experienced any material losses on our availableforsale investments to the extent we determine that a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary the associated investment is valued at current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 

lease commitments  — as of april 25 2008 we have three arrangements with bnp to lease our land for a period of 99 years to construct approximately 569697 square feet of office space and a parking structure costing up to 1625 million we also have a fourth arrangement with bnp to lease our land for a period of 99 years to construct approximately 120000 square feet of data center costing up to 610 million for a term of five and a half years after completion of construction we will pay minimum lease payments which vary based on the libor plus a spread in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we entered into an additional financing and operating leasing arrangements with bnp to lease approximately 374274 square feet of three buildings located in sunnyvale california for 1011 million for a term of five years we have the option to renew these leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnp a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 25 2008 would increase our total lease payments under the initial fiveyear term by approximately 35 million we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases as additional cash flow generated from operations is invested at current market rates it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a significant change in market interest rate 

 

debt obligation  — we have an outstanding secured credit agreement totaling 1726 million as of april 25 2008 under the terms of this arrangement we expect to make interest payments at libor plus a spread a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 25 2008 would increase our total interest payments by approximately 25 million we do not currently use derivatives to manage interest rate risk for this arrangement as additional cash flow generated from operations is invested at current market rates it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our debt in the event of a significant change in market interest rate 

 

nonmarketable securities  — we have from time to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be successful we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such nonmarketable investments accordingly we could lose all or part of these investments if there is an adverse change in the market price of a company we invest in our investments in nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of 112 million as of april 25 2008 and 89 million as of april 27 2007 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investments to their fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 25 2008 the gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

data protection platform products 

 

in recent years enterprises have centralized terabytes of data into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs higher utilization and simplified management however geopolitical events such as september 11 2001 natural disasters such as the hurricane katrina disaster government regulations such as securities and exchange commission’s “sec” rule 17a4 banking regulations such as basel ii increased privacy concerns such as thefts of laptops with sensitive data and industry guidelines such as pci payment card industry standard put forth by visa and mastercard have all put a spotlight on the need to protect and retain data for both the public and private sectors consolidation coupled with a higher probability of disasters has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss and its disruptive impact on the business at the same time compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to retain data for long periods of time as well as to secure data at rest 

 

data protection and retention have become critical it priorities requiring costeffective storage solutions that can help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business disruption at an affordable cost netapp offers a comprehensive set of hardware and software solutions including costeffective satabased storage with builtin data reduction capabilities disktodisk backup solutions a family of replication and business continuance solutions compliance and security solutions and tools to manage this information ecosystem 

 

data retention and archive software products 

 

to meet growing regulatory compliance demands faced by most enterprises network appliance offers a comprehensive suite of products to ensure data permanence accessibility and privacy across the variety of different regulations such as the sarbanesoxley act 21 cfr part 11 sec rule 17a4 and hipaa immutable costeffective resilient and reliable storage architectures can be created utilizing the snaplock ® products in conjunction with netapp nearstore platforms the information server 1200 products provide advanced capabilities for both the initial classification and subsequent ediscovery requirements our datafort ® product adds security and privacy by encrypting data while still allowing the capability to search the compliant data for legal discovery purposes if the need arises 

a significant demand is being created for diskbased digital content storage in applications such as medical images “pacs” video surveillance interactive voice records and web multimedia content the netapp nearstore storage platforms offer highly scalable costeffective platforms for these applications the netapp platforms based on open standardsbased protocols are easily integrated into the embedded solution vendor’s “esv” overall solution for these applications search indexing and classification capabilities of the information server 1200 product provide an easy way to access the relevant content in these massive data repositories as well as meet the electronic discovery needs for our customers 

 

nearstore 

 

the netapp nearstore family of products represents satabased storage platforms optimized for data protection and retention applications the netapp nearstore system bridges the gap between primary storage and offline storage by providing much faster data access than offline storage at a cost much lower than primary storage this makes nearstore ideal for data protection and retention applications such as disktodisk backup business continuance archival compliant retention and digital content storage 

 

the nearstore family consists of the r200 platform the nearstore virtual tape library “vtl” platforms and the fas platforms with sata drives and nearstore personality licenses the r200 is a sataonly platform based on data ontap and is available in capacities up to 168tb the nearstore vtl is a disktodisk backup appliance that appears like a tape library to a backup software application but provides the superior speed and reliability of disk technologies for any heterogeneous primary storage environment netapp has also expanded the capabilities of its entire fas platform line for nearline uses through a nearstore personality license that optimizes the system for data protection and retention workloads 

 

virtual tape library 

 

the netapp nearstore vtl solution is a highperformance easily managed system that significantly improves backup service levels and cost for traditional data center tape backup infrastructures nearstore vtl ranges in capacity from 7tb to 336tb and is based on netapp system software optimized for the rapid sequential data throughputs seen in data center backup environments that use traditional backup applications such as symantec ® netbackup tm and tivoli storage manager 

 

nearstore vtl delivers value to backup customers in two fundamental ways 1 it provides a far more reliable and highperformance storage target to backup applications than that provided by physical tape drives and libraries thus enabling more backups to be done in less time and 2 when backup data is moved directly from the nearstore vtl to physical tape drives and libraries the nearstore vtl streams the data at a rate that provides for highly efficient utilization of customers’ existing tape infrastructure the net benefits to the customer are that backup service levels improve substantially and expenditure on tape infrastructure is slowed 

 

key differentiators of the nearstore vtl versus other vtl competition are its hardwareaccelerated compression and tape smart sizing capabilities hardwareaccelerated compression enables nearstore vtl to compress backup data onto disk at very high sequential throughput rates up to 1900mbsec in the most highend netapp vtl solution thus enabling large amounts of customer data to be backed up in short amounts of time while using vtl disk very efficiently tape smart sizing enables physical tape utilization that is far more efficient than is possible with other vtls that directly create physical tapes

research and development 

 

we conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 research and development expenses represented 137 122 and 110 of our total revenue respectively these costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities although we develop many of our products internally we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate our expenditures on research and development activities in the last three fiscal years are discussed below under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — research and development we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

 

the research and development investment in fiscal year 2007 continued to emphasize innovation and enterprise solutions the storage platform family has been expanded from entrylevel solutions through highly scalable clusters this is represented by the storevault s500 at the low end through the fas3040 fas3070 fas6030 and fas6070 at the high end the s500 ideally suited for smbs can be configured with a minimum of 1tb of storage the highly clusterable fas family can exceed a breakthrough 6pb in capacity netapp continues to be unique in running a single storage appliance operating system data ontap across the breadth of our product line 

 

with the introduction of data ontap gx in june 2006 netapp delivered its most scalable solutions to date this system can satisfy the most demanding capacity and io requirements found in the highperformance computing and technical application markets the outstanding performance of this system was demonstrated by its ability to exceed 1 million operations per seconds using the industry standard and audited spec benchmark this is more than triple the performance of the highest previously reported spec results 

 

our software portfolio has grown over the past year new network and protocol capabilities have been delivered throughout the year examples include support for 10 gigabit ethernet iscsi boot microsoft simple 

san and microsoft multipathing support we have introduced new versions of snapmanager for oracle snapmanager for microsoft exchange and snapmanager for sap protection manager is now available and brings a new level of simplicity to automated backup and replication for disktodisk recovery we have also delivered the nextgeneration autosupport system that is well integrated with netapp global support services 

 

the vseries product line has gained traction this year the vseries brings the netapp ease of use and powerful virtualization capabilities to an expanded set of thirdparty storage arrays that include emc ibm hp hds fujitsu and others also in fy07 we added new platforms to the product offering including the v3040 v3070 v6030 and v6070 

 

the netapp datafort fc1020 was recognized as the “innovation of the year” by pc professional in 2006 the unique datafort approach to encryption of data at rest authentication key management and access control addresses the security requirements in demanding and regulated enterprise environments 

 

the nearstore vtl products experienced healthy growth throughout the year especially among large enterprise customers as several important new capabilities were added including hardwareaccelerated data compression support for the acsls protocol required by many highend tape libraries and a doubling of both maximum system performance and storage capacity the development of nextgeneration technologies such as deduplication is expected to further the adoption of netapp disktodisk backup solutions as customers continue to repurpose and downsize their existing tape backup systems 

 

our topio tm acquisition allows for heterogeneous anytoany data replication for disaster recovery application support and data migration replicatorx tm enables it organizations to replicate recover and protect data over any distance regardless of the source or target storage solution furthermore due to replicatorx and data ontap integration it allows a broad set of potential customers to quickly and easily benefit from the powerful data ontap capabilities such as flexvol and flexclone

customer base 

 

our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments and vertical markets examples include

seasonality 

 

our operating results have not been significantly affected by seasonality in the past in the future as we expand our presence internationally and into other vertical markets we may experience more seasonality in the sale of our products for example sales to european customers tend to be weaker in the summer months and sales to the us government are typically stronger in the third calendar quarter 

 

see “risk factors — factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and “risk factors — risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results accompanying this annual report on form 10k” 

 

backlog 

 

network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may 

cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues 

 

see “risk factors — factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” 

 

competition 

 

the storage market is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology and rapidly changing business models 

 

in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hds hp ibm and sun microsystems we also see dell inc “dell” as an emerging competitor in the storage marketplace primarily due to the business partnership that has been established between dell and emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including the storage systems group of lsi logic corporation “lsi logic” in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems as a result of their acquisition of storagetek technology corporation our nearstore vtl appliances also compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space 

 

additionally a number of small new companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline and vtl storage markets and the storage security markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and storage security markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities professional services and customer service and support 

 

see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results” and “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance” 

 

proprietary rights 

 

we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance name and logo data ontap datafabric faserver ®  flexvol filerview nearstore netapp netcache secureshare snapdrive snaplock snapmanager snapmirror snaprestore snapvault wafl and others as trademarks in the us other us trademarks and some of the other us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 

 

see “risk factors — if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating results” 

 

environmental disclosure 

 

various federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in our manufacturing failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are fully compliant with all applicable environmental laws 

 

see “risk factors — our business is subject to changing laws and regulations environmental legislation” accompanying this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occurs our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following 

 

 20 

 

  

in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be different from what we forecast we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 

 

we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets our financial results will be adversely impacted if revenues do not meet our expectations our operating profit may be negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time if our revenues are lower than expected our fixed expenses could adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with revenues 

 

for example due to macroeconomic conditions and an it spending slowdown in the us our fourth quarter fiscal 2007 bookings were backend loaded and finished lower than our forecast in addition in the last two weeks of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2007 we experienced a shift in the mix of our bookings towards more deferred elements as a result we did not build our normal levels of nondeferred backlog at the end of the fourth quarter which will impact the first quarter of fiscal 2008 without the benefit of normal backlog we do not expect our usual level of growth in first quarter revenue and as a result our expense levels as a percentage of our revenue will be above our targeted business model given the lack of growth in our nondeferred backlog we lowered our forecasts for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in revenues operating margins and earnings 

 

due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

the marketplace for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 21 

 

  

in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

macroeconomic conditions and it spending slowdown in the us as well as variations in our expected operating performance may continue to cause volatility in our stock price we are unable to predict changes in general economic conditions and when global it spending rates will be affected furthermore if there are future reductions in either domestic or international it spending rates or if it spending rates do not increase our revenues operating results and stock price may continue to be adversely affected 

 

our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 

 

our revenues are difficult to forecast we use a “pipeline” system a common industry practice to forecast revenues and trends in our business sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into contracts varies from customer to customer can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in particular a slowdown in it spending or weak economic conditions or evolving technology generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as our customers’ purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled moreover even after contracts have been executed extensive analysis is required before the timing of revenue recognition can be reliably determined this delay reflects both the complexity of the revenue recognition rules applicable to software and the effect that the multiple element arrangements and other terms and conditions can have when these rules are applied 

 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance or if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products or if we cannot provide the level of service and support for our new products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however our new products may not achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact our sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new 

products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

 

as we enter into new or emerging markets we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition we may not be able to provide products service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services from us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 

 

an increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hds hp ibm and sunstoragetek we also see dell inc as a competitor in the storage marketplace primarily through its business partnership with emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including lsi logic in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sunstoragetek our nearstore vtl appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space additionally a number of small new privatelyheld companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets and the nearline and nearstore vtl storage markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products in recent years rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers which could subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 

 

our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including 

 

  

component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and semiconductor memory 

components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers 

 

in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that are incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 

 

the loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

 

we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products our reliance on our thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results as of april 27 2007 we have no purchase commitment under these agreements 

 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the inability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if these markets do not continue to grow at the rates at which we forecast growth our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 

 

for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceuticals and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the us and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and therefore we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast 

we are also exposed to unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment a reduction in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the storage and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product and service solutions and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

 

we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our storage systems as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages may be negatively affected 

 

our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

  

changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as continued investments in our customer support infrastructure and changes in the mix between technical support services and professional services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

 

our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

 25 

 

  

the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip recently some other companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of an examination our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future acquisitions and nonmarketable securities and these investments may not achieve our objectives 

 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities 

 

acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value integration risks and issues may include but are not limited to key personnel retention and assimilation management distraction technical development and unexpected costs and liabilities including goodwill impairment charges in addition we may be unable to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

 

on occasion we invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies as of april 27 2007 the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled 89 million investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky and some of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent on these companies product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on these companies’ future prospects they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments in them would likely become impaired in fiscal 2007 we recorded a 21 million writedown relating to our investments in two privatelyheld companies 

we cannot assure you that our oem relationship with ibm will generate significant revenue 

 

in april 2005 we announced a strategic partner relationship with ibm as part of the relationship we entered into an original equipment manufacturing “oem” agreement that enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on network appliance unified solutions including nearstore and the netapp vseries systems as well as associated software offerings while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time therefore we cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in future years in addition we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell or their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing in the event that sales through ibm will increase we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts our operating results and financial condition could be harmed in addition since this agreement is relatively new we do not have a history upon which to base our analysis of its future success 

 

currently we do not and cannot assure you that this oem relationship will generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenue may be impacted negatively 

 

an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors we have significant partner relationships with database business application and backup management companies including microsoft oracle sap and symantec a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on the progress of our new products under development with that partner 

 

we cannot assure you that we are able to maintain existing resellers and attract new resellers and that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships in addition we do not have exclusive relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as valueadded resellers “var” systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners in fiscal 2007 our indirect channels accounted for 596 of our consolidated revenues 

 

however in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenue as we have forecasted we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to do so we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products however because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners at the same time our indirect channel partners may offer products that are competitive to ours in addition because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing sales and support of our competitors’ products than ours if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our products we will not be able to maintain 

or increase our revenue as we have forecasted which would have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively or if our resellers’ financial conditions or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we conduct business internationally for the year ended april 27 2007 447 of our total revenues was from international customers including us exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 

 

our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets conversely lowering our price in local currency may result in lower usbased revenue for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 

 

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations potentially adverse tax consequences could negatively impact the operating and financial results from international operations international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands 

 

our operating results have not been significantly affected by seasonality in the past in the future as we expand our presence internationally we may experience more seasonality in the sale of our products for example sales to european customers tend to be weaker in the summer months which is our first fiscal quarter 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

if we fail to manage our expanding business effectively our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future operating results depend to a large extent on management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth including but not limited to expanding international operations forecasting revenues addressing new markets controlling expenses implementing and enhancing infrastructure investing in people facilities and capital equipment and managing our assets an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

in addition continued expansion could strain our current management financial manufacturing and other systems and may require us to implement and improve those systems if we experience any problems with any improvement or expansion of these systems procedures or controls or if these systems procedures or controls are not designed implemented or improved in a costeffective and timely manner our operations may be materially and adversely affected in addition any failure to implement improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

as we continue to grow our business we are likely to incur costs earlier than some of the anticipated benefits which could harm our operating results a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed which could materially and adversely affect our net income 

 

we are increasing our investment in engineering sales service support and other functions to grow our business we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect which could harm our business 

 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner 

 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

 

any political military world health eg sars avian flu or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire floods hurricanes power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education background and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

undetected software errors hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

 

our products may contain undetected software errors hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in 

new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to remedy a product defect we may experience a failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

 

in addition we may be subject to losses that may result or are alleged to result from defects in our products which could subject us to claims for damages including consequential damages based on our historical experience we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low however should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims our business could be adversely impacted 

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some us trademarks and some usregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 

 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be time consuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

 

we have recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 27 2007 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 

 

because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

 

our ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new accounting requirements such as sfas no 123r 

 

the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other sharebased payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of income option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate we have chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to purchase the company’s common stock as permitted by sab no 107 as of april 29 2006 the contractual life of our stock options was shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’ exercise behavior it may change the expected term of an option going forward sfas no 123r requires us to use estimated forfeitures and therefore the adoption of sfas no 123r could have a material impact on the timing of and based on the accuracy of estimates of future actual forfeitures the amount of stockbased compensation expense given the unpredictable nature of the “black scholes” variables and other management assumptions such as number of options to be granted underlying strike price and associated income tax impacts it is very difficult to estimate stockbased compensation expense for any given quarter or year any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact our ability to make accurate forecasts of future earnings and volatility of our stock price if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated securities class action litigation could be brought against us or the market price of our common stock could decline or both could occur as a result we could incur significant losses and our operating results may be below our expectations and those of investors and stock market analysts 

 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us 

 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us however government demand is unpredictable and there is no guarantee of future revenue growth from the us government government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending on infrastructures if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern our financial results may be harmed we cannot assure you that revenue from the us government will continue to grow in the future 

the general services administration “gsa” is currently auditing our records under the schedule contracts it had with us to verify our compliance with various contract provisions if the audit determines that we did not comply with such provisions we may be required to pay the gsa a potential settlement the exact date for completion of the audit and the subsequent negotiation process is unknown and may not be concluded for some time our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of our audit will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows

overview 

 

enterprises are generating vast quantities of data we are experiencing a worldwide data explosion driven by rapid growth of broadband internet access the proliferation of data devices and the need to protect critical data through replication the “digital footprints” of everyday life are growing exponentially as the volume of data grows so does the complexity of data storage and management data ownership and the burdens of managing data continue to challenge our enterprise customers data growth greater global demands on data access more complex legal requirements increasing consequences for data outages and greater data longevity all contribute to the growing burden of responsibility on it professionals in response cios and it professionals are looking for solutions to help simplify data storage it administration improve the capabilities of storage systems and reduce total costs of ownership companies are migrating toward modular unified storage systems away from large fixed expensive frameclass arrays and inefficient directattached storage there is a growing trend toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage pool 

 

we believe that our strategic investments are targeted at some of the strongest growth areas of the storage market such as modular storage archive and compliance data protection data classification data discovery data migration data permanence data security and privacy iscsi and grid computing however if any storage market 

trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated our business could be materially adversely affected 

 

in fiscal 2007 despite continuous downward pricing pressures and competitive environments our revenue continued to grow faster than that of our competitors we expect to continue to experience price declines per petabyte for our hardware products which may have an adverse impact on our future gross margins if not offset by a product mix with higher software content and higher average selling prices associated with new products at the same time we also expect our future gross margins may be negatively affected by factors such as global service investment cost competition indirect sales including oem and high disk content partially offset by new product introductions and addon software mix 

 

while we reported solid fiscal 2007 results with a 36 annual revenue growth we were not immune to the macroeconomic spending slowdown in the us our fourth quarter fiscal 2007 bookings were backend loaded and finished lower than our forecast in addition in the last two weeks of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2007 we experienced a shift in the mix of our bookings toward more deferred elements as a result we did not build our normal levels of nondeferred backlog at the end of the fourth quarter which will impact the first quarter of fiscal 2008 without the benefit of normal backlog we do not expect our usual level of growth in first quarter revenue and as a result our expense levels as a percentage of our revenue will be above our targeted business model we will slow our rate of hiring and investment spending in order to return to our targeted business model given the lack of growth in our nondeferred backlog we lowered our forecasts for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in revenues operating margins and earnings 

 

although we are faced with a first quarter that does not have the benefit of typical backlog levels we believe our business fundamentals remain intact we remain confident in the competitiveness of our products and in our ability to grow our business over the long term we continue to make progress across many areas of the organization including broadening and enhancing our enterprise solutions supporting our channelpartners and deepening our professional services coverage we believe our products continue to offer the best priceperformance value in the industry and we further extended our ability to help customers do “more with less” with new product introductions 

 

fiscal 2007 highlights 

 

our fiscal 2007 revenue grew year over year and the increase was across all major products categories and geographies the net increase in revenues was attributable to increased software licenses software upgrade and maintenance arrangements increased service revenue an expanded portfolio with new products and solutions for the enterprise customers and was partially offset by lower costpermegabyte disks and a decline in shipments and lower average selling prices of our older generation products some of the key fiscal 2007 highlights included 

 

increased our penetration into enterprise data centers and enhanced data management and data protection solutions from a product perspective we continued to enhance our data management and data protection portfolios with a key acquisition and several product introductions we extended our data center portfolio with several additions including new midrange and highend platforms broader fibre channel storage area network capabilities significant enhancements in the netapp manageability software family and new professional services all aimed at making enterprise data center management easier for customers who demand highperformance san solutions and increased application uptime to meet their business needs we anticipate the san competitiveness of our new midrange along with the strength of our highend sanconfigured systems to continue to contribute to an increase in the blockbased protocols component of our business we also continued to gain momentum in the san market while maintaining market leadership in both networkattached storage and iscsi 

 

extended our channelpartner opportunities we continued to make progress in penetrating and expanding our business in enterprise data centers with missioncritical partners our fiscal 2007 channel mix demonstrated increased expansion through our partner programs with approximately 596 of our business coming through indirect channels and the remaining 404 coming through direct sales higher growth rates in our indirect channels demonstrated our increasing leverage giving us broader market reach and increasing enterprise penetration 

expanded our global services and support it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a global comprehensive endtoend suite of worldclass service and support solutions designed to help our customers meet their goals of simplifying their storage solutions we increased our business with our top enterprise customers who typically purchase more complete and longerterm service packages the growth in service revenue in fiscal 2007 was also driven by increases in professional services we plan to continue to invest in our global services and support and believe that such investments will help accelerate the adoption rate of our technology we cannot assure you that service revenue will continue to grow at previous rates 

 

broadened our total addressable market and extended our product lines into adjacent spaces we have brought a more comprehensive set of products to the market place with the new highend offering our nextgeneration scaleout operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality the disktodisk backup solution in the vtl space and our entry into the small to mediumsized business market we also continued to broaden our addressable market by increasing our focus on the vseries product line which uses virtualization to let customers take advantage of the management simplicity of netapp data ontap in front of their storage from other vendors our acquisition of topio in december 2006 will also help us expand our heterogeneous data protection portfolio as part of our plan to broaden our total addressable market 

 

fiscal 2007 financial performance 

 

  

critical accounting estimates and policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

we believe that the following accounting policies are “critical” as defined by the securities and exchange commission in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain we also have other important policies including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective these policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

 

we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

 

  

revenue recognition and allowances 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition sop no 972 and related interpretations to our product sales both hardware and software because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware we recognize revenue when 

 

  

our multiple element arrangements include our systems and generally may also include one or more of the following undelivered softwarerelated elements software upgrade and maintenance arrangements premium hardware maintenance and storage review services our software upgrade and maintenance arrangements entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times revenues from software upgrade and maintenance arrangements premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term generally from 

one to three years standard hardware warranty costs are considered an obligation under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies and expensed as a cost of service when revenue is recognized we also offer extended service contracts which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance at the end of the warranty term revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term we typically sell technical consulting services separately from any of our other revenue elements either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining costs are accrued as the remaining undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory for arrangements with multiple elements we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements “the residual method” 

 

for our undelivered softwarerelated elements we apply the provisions of sop no 972 and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately either alone in the case of software upgrade and maintenance arrangements or as a bundled element which always includes software upgrade and maintenance arrangements and premium hardware maintenance and may also include storage review services to determine the fair value of these elements we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices we believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements if vsoe cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements paragraph 12 of sop 972 would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered 

 

for income statement presentation purposes once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements we allocate revenue first to software upgrade and maintenance arrangements based on vsoe of its separate fair value and then the residual is allocated to other service revenues 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns current trends and our expectations regarding future experience we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods while we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of current and future allowance in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 27 2007 was 26 million compared to 24 million as of april 28 2006 during the year ended april 28 2006 we reduced our reserve by 15 million due to overall improvement in our collections history however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

 

identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than 

management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets in addition a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our gross and operating margins we currently do not foresee changes to useful lives or writedowns to these assets 

 

under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required in fiscal 2007 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment however any future writedowns of goodwill would adversely affect our operating margins as of april 27 2007 our assets included 6011 million in goodwill see note 14 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recorded goodwill of 1147 million in connection with our topio acquisition and a reduction of goodwill for 12 million in connection with the divestiture of certain netcache assets 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the us statutory tax rate of 350 the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the us and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have provided a valuation allowance of 210 million as of april 27 2007 compared to 4312 million as of april 28 2006 on certain of our deferred tax assets we adopted sfas no 123r effective the beginning of our fiscal year ended april 27 2007 under sfas no 123r tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options should not be realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable pursuant to footnote 82 of sfas no 123r on a prospective basis we no longer include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures the tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards and their corresponding valuation allowance excluded under footnote 82 for the year ended april 27 2007 are 3633 million the valuation allowance at april 28 2006 related to net operating loss carryforwards conditional royalty carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards attributable to the exercise of employee stock options 

 

we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between foreign and us tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip recently some other companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of an examination our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows however if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an 

amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our overall effective tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 fin no 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction fin no 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax positions for taxes accounted for under fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 and substantially changes the applicable accounting model we are required to adopt fin no 48 for our fiscal year beginning april 28 2007 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

 

inventory writedowns 

 

our net inventory balance was 549 million as of april 27 2007 compared to 645 million as of april 28 2006 inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or market we perform an indepth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and on our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margins in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold during the past few years our inventory reserves have generally been sufficient to cover excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in subsequent periods 

 

we record purchase commitment liabilities with our contract manufacturers and suppliers as a result of changes in demand forecasts or as we transition our products as of april 27 2007 and april 28 2006 we did not have purchase commitment liabilities under such arrangements 

 

we engage in extensive ongoing product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our environmental compliance and could incur higher costs including additional reserves for excess component inventory 

 

restructuring accruals 

 

in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and a consolidation of our facilities in fiscal 2006 we implemented the third restructuring plan related to the move of our global service center operations in determining restructuring charges we analyze our future business requirements in order to properly align and manage our business commensurate with our future revenue levels 

 

our restructuring costs and any resulting accruals involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made some of which may be provided by third parties in recording severance reserves we accrue a liability when the following conditions have been met employees’ rights to receive compensation are attributable to employees’ services already rendered the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate payment of the compensation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in recording the facilities lease restructuring reserve we make various assumptions including the time period over 

which the facilities are expected to be vacant expected sublease terms expected sublease rates anticipated future operating expenses and expected future use of the facilities 

 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring and lease loss accruals in the future we estimated our facility and severance restructuring reserve to be 21 million as of april 27 2007 our fiscal 2006 facility restructuring reserve included a 10 million reduction related to the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility net of related costs 

 

impairment losses on investments 

 

as of april 27 2007 our shortterm investments have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value there have been no significant declines in fair value of investments that are considered to be otherthantemporary for any of the three years in the period ended april 27 2007 the fair value of our availableforsale investments reflected in the consolidated balance sheets were 9357 million and 11028 million as of april 27 2007 and april 28 2006 respectively included in these balances were shortterm restricted investments of 1160 million as of april 27 2007 and shortterm and longterm restricted investments of 1367 million and 1044 million respectively as of april 28 2006 in addition our availableforsale investments also included an investment in a publicly held company of 129 million which was based on quoted market prices on april 27 2007 we had no investments in publicly held companies as of april 28 2006 we have not identified any of these declines to be otherthantemporary as market declines of our investments have been caused by interest rate changes and were not due to creditworthiness because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes 

 

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value and our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we would reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values for investments in publicly held companies we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our investments in these companies are below their cost basis are judged to be otherthantemporary the ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly held companies is subject to market price volatility until they are sold we have no impairment losses on our availableforsale investments for fiscal 2007 and 2006 

 

for nonmarketable securities the impairment analysis requires the identification of events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment including revenue and earnings trends overall business prospects limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities and general market conditions in the investees’ industry our investments in privatelyheld companies were 89 million and 110 million as of april 27 2007 and april 28 2006 respectively during fiscal 2007 we recorded impairment of 21 million for investments in privatelyheld companies we had no impairment losses on our investments in privatelyheld companies in fiscal 2006 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment  using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes 

option pricing model and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate we have chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to purchase the company’s common stock as permitted by staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 as of april 29 2006 the contractual life of our stock options was shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’ exercise behavior it may change the expected term of an option going forward sfas no 123r requires us to use estimated forfeitures and therefore the adoption of sfas no 123r could have a material impact on the timing of and based on the accuracy of estimates of future actual forfeitures the amount of stockbased compensation expense any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stockbased compensation expense for the future likewise the shortening of the contractual life of our options could change the estimated exercise behavior in a manner other than currently expected 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas no 159 allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities that are not otherwise measured at fair value if the fair value option for an eligible item is elected unrealized gains and losses for that item shall be reported in current earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between the different measurement attributes the company elects for similar types of assets and liabilities this statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning april 27 2008 we are currently evaluating the effect if any that the adoption of sfas no 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt sfas no 157 for our fiscal year beginning april 27 2008 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact 

 

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated sab no 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november 15 2006 we adopted sab 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin no 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction fin no 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax 

positions for taxes accounted for under fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 and substantially changes the applicable accounting model we are required to adopt fin no 48 for our fiscal year beginning april 28 2007 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

product revenues  — product revenues increased by 322 to 20859 million in fiscal 2007 from 15774 million in fiscal 2006 product revenues growth was across all geographies 

product revenues were favorably affected by the following factors 

 

  

product revenues were negatively affected by the following factors 

 

  

our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve as a result the wide variation in customized configuration can significantly impact revenue cost of revenues and gross margin performance price changes volumes and product model mix can have an effect on changes in product revenues the impact on these forces is significantly affected by the configuration of systems shipped 

 

software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues  — software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues increased by 427 to 3413 million in fiscal 2007 from 2391 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed software upgrade and maintenance arrangements and an increased number of new enterprise customers software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues represented 122 and 116 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 509 to 3771 million in fiscal 2007 from 2499 million in fiscal 2006 

 

the increase in absolute dollars was due to the following factors 

 

 45 

 

while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solutions we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2008 or beyond 

 

a large portion of our service revenues is deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years service revenues represented 134 and 121 of total revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

international total revenues  — international total revenues including us exports increased by 329 in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 international total revenues were 12540 million or 447 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to 9438 million or 457 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 the increase in international sales was primarily driven by the same factors outlined under the total revenue discussion as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

product gross margins  — product gross margins were 609 for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

product gross margins for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 were affected by the following factors 

 

  

we expect higher disk content associated with highend storage systems will negatively affect our gross margins in the future if not offset by increases in software revenue and new highermargin products 

 

stockbased compensation expense included in cost of product revenues was 37 million for fiscal 2007 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was 176 million and 118 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of product revenues will be 211 million for fiscal year 2008 204 million for fiscal year 2009 159 million for fiscal year 2010 63 million for fiscal year 2011 and none thereafter 

 

software upgrade and maintenance arrangements gross margins  — software upgrade and maintenance arrangements gross margins was 970 and 965 for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively due primarily to improved productivity and a larger installed base renewals upgrades and an increasing number of new enterprise customers 

 

service gross margins  — service gross margins increased to 274 in fiscal 2007 compared to 259 in fiscal 2006 cost of service revenue increased by 479 to 2736 million in fiscal 2007 from 1850 million in fiscal 2006 stockbased compensation expense of 101 million was included in the cost of service revenue for fiscal 2007 

 

the change in service gross margins year over year was primarily impacted by an increase in services revenue improved productivity and continued spending in our service infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer base this spending included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs service gross margins will typically be impacted by factors such as timing of technical support service initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure in fiscal 2008 we expect service margins to experience some variability over time as we continue to build out our service capability and capacity to support our growing enterprise customers and new products 

 

sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses stockbased compensation expense and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 495 to 8958 million for fiscal 2007 from 5991 million for fiscal 2006 these expenses were 320 and 289 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively the 

increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability higher partner program expenses the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions and stockbased compensation expenses recognized under adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

the stockbased compensation expenses included in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2007 was 717 million compared to 40 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in stockbased compensation was due to adoption of sfas no 123r amortization of acquisitionsrelated trademarkstradenames and customer contracts and relationships included in sales and marketing expenses was 29 million and 21 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively based on identified intangibles related to our acquisitions recorded at april 27 2007 estimated future amortization such as trademarks and customer relationships included in sales and marketing expenses will be 39 million for fiscal 2008 38 million for fiscal 2009 37 million for fiscal 2010 27 million for fiscal 2011 16 million for fiscal 2012 and 09 million thereafter 

 

we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth 

 

research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits stockbased compensation prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges fees paid to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents 

 

research and development expenses increased 533 to 3854 million for fiscal 2007 from 2513 million for fiscal 2006 these expenses represented 137 and 122 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased headcount ongoing operating impact of the acquisitions ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability and stockbased compensation expense recognized under adoption of sfas no 123r for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 no software development costs were capitalized 

 

the stockbased compensation expenses included in research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 was 513 million compared to 83 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in stockbased compensation was due to adoption of sfas no 123r included in research and development expenses are capitalized patents amortization of 20 million and 20 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively based on capitalized patents recorded at april 27 2007 estimated future capitalized patents amortization expenses will be 20 million for fiscal year 2008 05 million in fiscal 2009 02 million in fiscal 2010 and none thereafter 

 

we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we expect to continuously support current and future product development and enhancement efforts and to incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies we intend to continuously broaden our existing product offerings and to introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio 

 

we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2008 primarily due to ongoing costs associated with the development of new products and technologies increased headcount and the operating impact of potential future acquisitions 

 

general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses increased 589 to 1475 million for fiscal 2007 from 928 million for fiscal 2006 these expenses represented 53 and 46 of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability and increased headcount higher stockbased compensation expense recognized under sfas no 123r and higher legal expenses and professional fees for general corporate matters 

 

we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2008 due to increased general and administrative headcount the stockbased compensation expenses included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 was 262 million compared to 10 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in 

stockbased compensation was due to adoption of sfas no 123r amortization of covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expenses was 10 million and 22 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively based on identified intangibles related to our acquisitions recorded at january 26 2007 estimated future amortization of covenants not to compete relating to our acquisitions will be 02 million for fiscal year 2008 and none thereafter 

 

restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in information technology “it” spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and consolidations of our facilities as of april 27 2007 we have no outstanding balance in our restructuring liability for the first restructuring the second restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters in fiscal 2006 we implemented a third restructuring plan related to the move of our global services center operations from sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our research triangle park facility in north carolina 

 

our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in previous management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in fiscal 2007 we did not record any reduction in restructuring reserve resulting from a change in estimate for our third restructuring plan in fiscal 2006 we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of 13 million resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility in fiscal 2006 we also recorded a restructuring charge of 11 million primarily attributed to severancerelated amounts and relocation expenses related to the third restructuring plan 

 

of the reserve balance at april 27 2007 05 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 16 million was classified as longterm obligations the balance of the reserve is expected to be paid by fiscal 2011 

 

the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 27 2007 in thousands 

 

 

 

gain on sale of assets  — we recorded a gain of 253 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of certain assets to blue coat systems inc “blue coat” see note 16 of the consolidated financial statements we recorded revenues of 574 million 711 million and 755 million from netcache products for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the contribution to operating income from these products was not significant 

 

interest income  — interest income was 688 million and 415 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher average interest rates on our investment portfolio we expect interest income to increase compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of our cash and invested balances being reinvested in a higher interest rate portfolio environment 

interest expense  — interest expense was 116 million and 13 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to interest incurred in connection with our debt 

 

net gain loss on investments  — net gain loss on investments included a net writedown of 21 million related to the impairment of our investment in privatelyheld companies in fiscal 2007 

 

other income expense net  — other income was 28 million for fiscal 2007 other income for fiscal 2007 included net exchange gains from foreign currency of 24 million and other income of 04 million other income included net exchange gains from foreign currency of 17 million for fiscal 2006 we believe that periodtoperiod changes in foreign exchange gains or losses will continue to be impacted by hedging costs associated with our forward and option activities and forecast variance 

 

provision for income taxes  — for fiscal 2007 our annual effective tax rate was 172 versus 239 for fiscal 2006 which included a 64 increase to account for the income tax provision of 225 million associated with the cash repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings the decrease to the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of this onetime item and the impact of income taxed at lower tax rates in foreign jurisdiction the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the rate derived from a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our principal european subsidiary the availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions offset partially by an increase in the rate due to the tax effect of stock compensation under sfas no 123r 

 

the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an income tax provision of 225 million or 006 per share associated with the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings this tax raised our 2006 effective tax rate by 64 under the onetime incentive created pursuant to section 965 of the jobs act we will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan that conforms to the jobs act guidelines 

 

the 2006 tax relief and health care act was signed into law on december 20 2006 one of the provisions of this law was the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit from january 1 2006 and its extension through december 31 2007 the effective tax rates for the fiscal 2007 reflected the benefits attributable to the extension of the research and development tax credit provisions 

 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

 

product revenues  — product revenues increased by 251 to 15774 million in fiscal 2006 from 12606 million in fiscal 2005 product revenues growth was across all geographies this net increase year over year was specifically attributable to increased software licenses an increase in units shipped and an increase in demand for data protection and missioncritical storage environments partially offset by a decline in shipments and lower average selling prices of older generation products lower costpermegabyte disks 

 

product revenues were favorably affected by the following factors 

 

  

product revenues were negatively affected by the following factors

software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues  — software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues increased by 409 to 2391 million in fiscal 2006 from 1697 million in fiscal 2005 due primarily to a larger installed base renewals upgrades and an increasing number of new enterprise customers software upgrade and maintenance arrangements revenues represent 116 and 106 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 489 to 2499 million in fiscal 2006 from 1678 million in fiscal 2005

a large portion of our service revenues is deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years and are classified as shortterm and longterm deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets service revenues represented 121 and 105 of total revenues for fiscal year 2006 and 2005 respectively

the improvement in service gross margins for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in services revenue and improved productivity offset by the continued spending in our service infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer base this spending included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs 

 

sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 280 to 5991 million for fiscal 2006 from 4682 million for fiscal 2005 these expenses were 289 and 292 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively the increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability higher partner program expenses and the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions

compensation expenses related to stock options and restricted stock assumed in acquisitions were 10 million and 07 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively amortization of acquisitionsrelated covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expenses was 22 million and 51 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

inprocess research and development  — we recorded inprocess research and development charges of 50 million in fiscal 2006 related to the acquisition of decru the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition approximately 50 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting future net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the 

successful development of the acquired inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur research and development costs to bring the products from decru to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial conditions 

 

restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and consolidations of our facilities as of april 28 2006 we have no outstanding balance in our restructuring liability for the first restructuring the second restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we implemented a third restructuring plan related to the move of our global services center operations from sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our research triangle park facility in north carolina 

 

in fiscal 2006 we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of 13 million resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility in fiscal 2006 we recorded a restructuring charge of 11 million primarily attributed to severancerelated amounts and relocation expenses related to the third restructuring plan of the reserve balance at april 28 2006 09 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 21 million was classified as longterm obligations 

 

interest income  — interest income was 415 million and 242 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively included in interest income for fiscal 2005 was 13 million interest received on a tax refund the increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher average interest rates on our investment portfolio 

 

interest expense  — interest expense was 13 million and 01 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to interest incurred in connection with our debt 

 

other income expense net  — other income expense net included net exchange gains from foreign currency transactions of 17 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to forecast variances offset by hedging costs as a result of higher us interest rates compared to other countries net exchange losses from foreign currency transactions were 16 million in fiscal 2005 as a result of exchange rate volatility forecast variances and higher hedging costs 

 

provision for income taxes  — the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an income tax provision of 225 million or 006 per share associated with the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 under the onetime incentive created pursuant to section 965 of the jobs act we will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan that conforms to the jobs act guidelines 

 

for fiscal 2006 we had an effective tax rate of 239 to pretax income which included a 64 increase to account for the income tax provision of 225 million associated with the cash repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our principal european subsidiary the availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2005 our effective tax rate was 183 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations and other commercial commitments stock repurchase program capital commitments other sources and uses of cash flows and tax opportunities on our liquidity and capital resources 

 

balance sheet and other cash flows 

 

as of april 27 2007 as compared to april 28 2006 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased by 141 million to 13088 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations and from working capital working capital decreased by 628 million to 10533 million as of april 27 2007 compared to 11160 million as of april 28 2006 

during fiscal 2007 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 8645 million as compared with 5543 million and 4621 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively we reported net income of 2977 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 2665 million and 2258 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively a summary of the significant changes in noncash adjustments affecting net income is as follows 

 

  

in addition to net income and noncash adjustments in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 the primary factors that impacted the periodtoperiod change in cash flows relating to operating activities included the following 

 

  

a decrease in income taxes payable in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily attributable to income taxes payment of the onetime repatriation incentive under the jobs act during fiscal 2007 we remitted 196 million of income taxes relating to the foreign dividend repatriation in connection with the filing of our fiscal 2006 federal income tax return increased income taxes payable in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily reflecting the 225 million of federal and state tax liability relating to repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the jobs act and higher profitability in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

 

  

the above factors were partially offset by the effects of 

 

  

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 were 1658 million as compared to 1329 million and 936 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively we received net proceeds of 600 million in fiscal 2007 and used net proceeds of 1285 million and 2668 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively for net purchasesredemptions of shortterm investments we redeemed 1279 million of restricted investments and its interest income pledged with jp morgan chase in fiscal 2007 to repay the tranche a term loan with jp morgan chase see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements investing activities in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 also included new investments in privatelyheld companies of 16 million 93 million and 04 million respectively in fiscal 2007 we acquired topio inc for a purchase price of approximately 1461 million which consisted of the value of the assumed options cash payments of 1312 million and related transaction costs in fiscal 2006 we acquired alacritus and decru and incurred total cash payments including related transactions costs totaling 537 million in fiscal 2005 we acquired additional patents for a purchase price of approximately 09 million in fiscal 2007 we received 239 million in cash in connection with the sale of certain assets to blue coat we received 28 million 01 million and 03 million in proceeds from the sale of investments in privatelyheld companies in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively under a split dollar insurance arrangement with our ceo entered in may 2000 we paid total premiums of 102 million including 02 million for fiscal year 2005 in april 2005 our ceo reimbursed us 102 million for these premiums 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

we used 7473 million and 121 million in fiscal 2007 and 2005 respectively as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 428 million in fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2006 we borrowed 3000 million to fund the repatriation in cash from foreign earnings and investments under the american jobs creation act of 2004 “the jobs act” we made a repayment of 2149 million for our debt in fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we repurchased 226 million 174 million and 77 million shares of common stock at a total of 8057 million 4889 million and 1929 million respectively other financing activities provided 2155 million 2327 million and 1819 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively from sales of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the stockbased compensation expense recognized of 632 million were presented as financing cash flows for fiscal 2007 in accordance with sfas no 123r during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we withheld 53 million 11 million and 11 million in shares respectively from certain employees’ exercised shares of their restricted stock to reimburse for federal state and local withholding taxes obligations the increase in the amounts withheld year over year was due to the release of the decru assumed restricted stock units 

 

the change in cash flow from financing was primarily due to the effects of higher common stock repurchases partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity programs compared to the same period in the prior year net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 

 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

the jobs act created a onetime incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividendreceived deduction for certain dividends from certain nonus subsidiaries primarily as a result of this onetime repatriation incentive we remitted 196 million of income taxes with the filing of our fiscal year 2006 federal income tax return 

 

for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 the income tax benefit associated with dispositions of employee stock transactions was 1750 million 366 million and 278 million respectively if stock option exercise patterns change we may receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not receive the same level of tax benefits in the future which could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase 

stock repurchase program 

 

on november 15 2006 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program in which up to 8000 million of additional shares may be purchased at april 27 2007 3999 million remained available for future repurchase the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

 

debt 

 

in march 2006 we received proceeds from the term loans totaling 3000 million to finance a dividend under the jobs act see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements loan payments of 851 million are due in fiscal 2008 this debt was collateralized by restricted investments totaling 1160 million as of april 27 2007 in accordance with the payment terms of the loan agreement interest payments will be approximately 27 million in fiscal 2008 as of april 27 2007 we are in compliance with the liquidity and leverage ratio as required by the loan agreement with the lenders 

 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments 

 

the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at april 27 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

 

 

for purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable legally binding on us and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table

capital expenditure requirements 

 

we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future consistent with the growth in our business as we continue to invest in people land buildings capital equipment and enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california rtp north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed we expect to finance these construction projects including our commitments under facilities and equipment operating leases and any required capital expenditures over the next few years through cash from operations and existing cash cash equivalents and investments 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of april 27 2007 our financial guarantees of 34 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program and a foreign rent guarantee 

 

as of april 27 2007 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 3688 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 of fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” see “guarantees” in footnote 15 for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

 

we have commitments related to two lease arrangements with bnp for approximately 380000 square feet of office space to be located on land currently owned by us in sunnyvale california as further described above under “contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments” we have evaluated our accounting for this lease under the provisions of fin 46r and have determined the following 

 

  

accordingly we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnp lease assuming this transaction will continue to meet the provisions of fin 46r as new standards evolve over time our future minimum lease payments under this real estates lease will amount to a total of 1178 million reported under our note 4 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

as of april 27 2007 except for operating leases and other contractual obligations outlined under the “contractual cash obligations” table we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we also do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

 

key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories and future demand for our products and related pricing we expect to incur higher capital expenditures in the near future to expand our operations we will from time to time acquire products and businesses complementary to our business in the future we may continue to repurchase our common stock which would reduce cash cash equivalents andor shortterm investments available to fund future operations and meet other liquidity requirements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases contractual obligations and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next twelve months 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

market risk and market interest risk 

 

investment and interest income  — as of april 27 2007 we had availableforsale investments of 9357 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as available for sale these investments consisting primarily of corporate bonds corporate securities government municipal debt securities and auctionrate securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 27 2007 would cause the fair value of these availableforsale investments to decline by approximately 41 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our investment policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities we further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer we have not experienced any material losses on our availableforsale investments 

 

our investment portfolio also includes common stock holdings in blue coat see note 16 of the consolidated financial statements we are exposed to fluctuations in the market price of our investment in this company at the same time we are precluded from selling these shares until september 2007 as a result of these factors the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from this investment may vary materially from the current unrealized amount a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the fair market value from fair market value at april 27 2007 would cause the fair value of this investment to decrease by approximately 13 million 

 

lease commitments  — as of april 27 2007 we have two arrangements with bnp to lease our land for a period of 50 years to construct approximately 380000 square feet of office space and a parking structure costing up to 1035 million after completion of construction we will pay minimum lease payments which vary based on london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread we expect to pay lease payments on the first lease in october 2007 for a term of five years and the second lease in september 2008 for a term of five years we have the option to renew both leases for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnp a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 27 2007 would increase our total lease payments under the initial fiveyear term by approximately 28 million we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases as cash from operating cash flows is invested in a higher interest rate environment it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a significant increase in market interest rate 

 

debt obligation  — we have an outstanding variable rate term loan totaling 851 million as of april 27 2007 under terms of these arrangements we expect to pay interest payments at libor plus a spread a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 27 2007 would increase our total interest payments by approximately 04 million we do not currently use derivatives to manage interest rate risk 

 

nonmarketable securities  — we have from time to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be successful we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such nonmarketable investment accordingly we could lose all or part of this investment if there is an adverse change in the market price of the company we invest in our investments in nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of 89 million as of april 27 2007 and 110 million as of april 28 2006 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2007 we recorded a noncash 

otherthantemporary writedown of 21 million related to impairment of our investment in two privatelyheld companies 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 27 2007 the gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

network appliance inc 

sunnyvale california 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that network appliance inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of april 27 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of april 27 2007 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of april 27 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

vseries family 

 

netapp vseries is a networkbased solution that consolidates storage arrays from different suppliers enabling unified san and file access to data stored in heterogeneous fibre channel san storage arrays many enterprises have made significant investments in multiple storage architectures to support a variety of different application requirements this approach often results in inefficient fractionalized islands of underutilized storage that can be difficult to manage and costly to scale with vseries customers can consolidate storage from multiple vendors and achieve 

 

  

vseries family include v3000 v6000 gf270 and gf980 models and supports storage arrays from ibm corporation “ibm” hewlettpackard “hp” and hitachi data systems “hds” 

 

data ontap and key core systems software 

 

netapp fas and vseries storage solutions are all based on data ontap a highly optimized scalable and flexible operating system that uniquely supports a mix of san nas and ip san iscsi environments concurrently data ontap software integrates seamlessly into unix windows and web environments the data ontap operating system provides the foundation to build storage infrastructure and an enterprisewide data fabric for missioncritical business applications while lowering the tco and complexity typically associated with the management of largescale enterprise storage infrastructures 

 

data ontap includes the patented netapp wafl ® write anywhere file layout file management system and the resiliency offered by raiddp tm raid double parity a unique doubleparity software raid architecture data ontap supports all of the major industrystandard protocols’ storage as well as our complete suite of data management data replication and data protection software products 

 

the operating system also includes integrated secure access capabilities and filerview ®  a webbased element manager snapshot tm technology included as part of the base system enables online backups and provides rapid access to previous versions of data without requiring complete separate copies snapshot technology also eliminates the need to recover data from a tape archive in the event of a disaster or user error in addition secureshare ® is a multiprotocol lock management facility that is integrated into the data ontap microkernel the crossprotocol locking mechanism in secureshare ensures heterogeneous data sharing without compromising security data integrity or performance 

 

during fiscal year 2006 we also installed our new highperformance operating system data ontap gx at several customer sites data ontap gx a next generation version of our operating system leverages distributed systems technology acquired through the purchase of spinnaker networks with data ontap gx multiple netapp storage systems can be managed as a single entity under a global namespace this enables all members of an application server cluster to access data stored across all of the fas systems by using a single access point eliminating the traditional complexities of mapping application servers to storage systems this scaleout architecture is capable of achieving higher levels of aggregate system performance because data volumes can span multiple storage nodes additionally data ontap gx provides the ability to dynamically add storage resources and transparently redistribute data without any disruption to client systems the result is a storage system that combines the advantages of management simplicity with scalable performance and capacity 

data management software 

 

network appliance products are in use today in some of the largest data centers in the world these environments require enterprise class management tools netapp provides key management tools to increase productivity and simplify data management such tools include flexvol tm  flexclone tm  flexshare tm  and the data management family 

 

flexvol 

 

flexvol technology included in the data ontap operating system enables more efficient storage architectures with flexible volumes that do not require repartitioning of physical storage space the flexvol technology delivers storage virtualization solutions that can lower overhead and capital expenses reduce disruption and risk and provide the flexibility to adapt quickly and easily to the dynamic needs of the enterprise flexvol technology provisions storage resources automatically and enables the creation of multiple flexible volumes on a large pool of disks this flexibility helps organizations maximize storage utilization and efficiency simplify operations and make changes quickly and seamlessly without downtime 

 

flexclone 

 

netapp flexclone technology enables true data cloning or the instant replication of data volumes and data sets without requiring additional storage space at the time of creation each cloned volume is a transparent virtual copy that can be used for essential enterprise operations such as testing and bug fixing platform and upgrade checks multiple simulations against large data sets remote office testing and staging and marketspecific product variations only data that has changed uses actual disk space flexclone provides substantial space savings with minimal overhead customers can manage many more data set variations in less time and with less risk to production environments 

 

flexshare 

 

flexshare introduced in fiscal year 2006 and included in data ontap directs the way storage system resources are used to deliver an appropriate level of service for each application with flexshare you can host multiple workloads on a single netapp system and assign individual priorities to each flexshare gives storage administrators the ability to leverage existing infrastructure and increase processing utilization without sacrificing the performance allocated to businesscritical tasks using flexshare administrators can confidently consolidate disparate applications prioritize specific data sets and dynamically adjust priorities if business needs change

data protection products 

 

in recent years enterprises have centralized terabytes of data into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs higher utilization and simplified management on the other hand geopolitical events such as september 11 2001 natural disasters such as the katrina hurricane disaster government regulations such as securities and exchange commission’s “sec” rule 17a4 banking regulations such as basel ii increased privacy concerns such as laptop thefts with sensitive data and industry guidelines such as pci payment card industry standard put forth by visa and mastercard have all put a spotlight on the need to protect and retain data for both the public and private sectors consolidation coupled with a higher probability of disasters has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss and its disruptive impact on the business at the same time compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to retain data for long periods of time as well as secure data at rest data protection and retention have become critical it priorities requiring costeffective storage solutions that can help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business disruption at an affordable cost netapp offers a comprehensive set of hardware and software solutions including the nearstore satabased storage disktodisk backup solutions a family of replication and business continuance solutions compliance and security solutions and tools to manage this information ecosystem 

 

nearstore 

 

the netapp nearstore family of platforms represents satabased storage platforms optimized for data protection and retention applications the netapp nearstore system bridges the gap between primary storage and offline storage by providing much faster data access than offline storage at a cost much lower than primary storage this makes nearstore ideal for data protection and retention applications such as disktodisk backup business continuance archival compliant retention and digital content storage 

 

the nearstore family consists of the r200 platform the nearstore virtual tape library “vtl” platforms and the fas platforms with sata drives and nearstore personality licenses the r200 is a 

sataonly platform based on data ontap and is available in capacities up to 168tb the nearstore vtl is a disktodisk backup appliance that appears like a tape library to a backup software application but provides the superior speed and reliability of disk technologies for any heterogeneous primary storage environment netapp has also expanded the capabilities of its entire fas platform line for nearline uses through a nearstore personality license that optimizes the system for data protection and retention workloads 

 

virtual tape library 

 

the netapp nearstore vtl solution is a highperformance easily managed system that significantly improves backup service levels and cost for traditional data center tape backup infrastructures nearstore vtl ranges in capacity from 45tb to 168tb and is based on netapp system software optimized for the rapid sequential data throughputs seen in data center backup environments that use traditional backup applications such as symantec ® netbackup tm and tivoli storage manager 

 

nearstore vtl delivers value to backup customers in two fundamental ways 1 it provides a far more reliable and highperformance storage target to backup applications than that provided by physical tape drives and libraries thus enabling more backups to be done in less time and 2 when backup data is moved directly from the nearstore vtl to physical tape drives and libraries the nearstore vtl streams the data at a rate that provides for highly efficient utilization of customers’ existing tape infrastructure the net benefit to the customer is that backup service levels improve substantially and expenditure on tape infrastructure is slowed 

 

key differentiators of the nearstore vtl versus other vtl competition are its continuous self tuning and tape smart sizing capabilities continuous self tuning enables the nearstore vtl to deliver maximum performance with no manual tuning at all capacities something no other vtl can do tape smart sizing enables physical tape utilization that is far more efficient than is possible with other vtls that directly create physical tapes 

 

data protection software products 

 

network appliance offers comprehensive business continuance and disk backup solutions for enterprise customer environments 

 

syncmirror ®  metrocluster snapmirror and snaprestore ® products provide the most appropriate level of data availability and cost of protection matched to the recovery point objectives “rpos” and recovery time objectives “rtos” of customer environments snapmirror supports fully synchronous nearsynchronous and asynchronous remote replication for easy setup management and quick recovery syncmirror in conjunction with other netapp technologies such as raiddp provides the highest level of local data availability to allow netapp storage systems to continue delivering data after as many as five simultaneous physical disk component failures metrocluster enables a highly available campus or metropolitan business continuance solution minimizing downtime through autosite failover snaprestore greatly minimizes recovery time in the event of a data corruption or loss by allowing rapid restoration of a volume from an earlier point in time using snapshot technology 

 

snapvault open systems snapvault “ossv” and snapvault for netbackup products provide network and storageoptimized disktodisk backup solutions with the ability to transmit only the changes from one backup to the next and eliminate duplicates in storage netapp disktodisk products offer very costeffective solutions to help customers with shrinking backup windows rapid recovery objectives and remote office backup challenges in conjunction with other products such as flexclone and lockvault tm  customers can significantly enhance the value of their backup investment by utilizing the backups for other uses such as test and development compliant retention and business intelligence 

data retention and archive software products 

 

to meet growing regulatory compliance demands faced by most enterprises network appliance offers a comprehensive suite of products to ensure data permanence accessibility and privacy across the variety of different regulations such as sarbanesoxley act 21 cfr part 11 sec rule 17a4 and hipaa immutable costeffective resilient and reliable storage architectures can be created utilizing the snaplock ® products in conjunction with netapp nearstore platforms the information server 1200 products provide advanced capabilities for both the initial classification and subsequent ediscovery requirements the decru datafort tm product adds security and privacy by encrypting data while still allowing the capability to search the compliant data for legal discovery purposes if the need arises 

 

a significant demand is being created for diskbased digital content storage in applications such as medical images “pacs” video surveillance interactive voice records and web multimedia content the netapp nearstore storage platforms offer highly scalable costeffective platforms for these applications the netapp platforms based on open standardsbased protocols are easily integrated into the embedded solution vendor’s “esv” overall solution for these applications search indexing and classification capabilities of the information server 1200 product provide an easy way to access the relevant content in these massive data repositories 

 

decru 

 

netapp also focuses on storage security and with the acquisition of decru we have taken a leadership position in the emerging storage security category decru datafort storage security appliances provide a unified platform for enterprisewide security including heterogeneous nas das iscsi san and tape environments the decru ® platform combines wirespeed encryption access controls authentication and automated key management to provide strong security for data at rest over the last twelve months decru has secured design wins with many of the top global corporations including the financial services media software telecommunications and pharmaceutical sectors as well as numerous government agencies worldwide flagship customers such as iron mountain and the us marine corps have highlighted decru leadership in technology security and deployment capabilities 

 

decru has announced strategic distribution agreements with emc corporation “emc” and quantum corporation and works closely with the major storage and networking firms including brocade communication systems inc cisco systems inc “cisco” hp ibm mcdata corporation oracle corporation “oracle” sun microsystems inc and symantec corporation “symantec” to develop solutions and test interoperability 

 

content delivery netcache ®  

 

the netcache suite of solutions is designed to manage control and improve access to webbased information built on an extremely reliable and scalable platform and working with a range of software partners netcache provides solutions to large enterprises to manage internet access and security “ias” enabling it managers to control who in their user base is going where on the internet when and what content is being accessed furthermore using compression localized caching and other techniques netcache also optimizes the wide area network “wan” to secure and accelerate delivery of information the same functionality for public internet access is used to control and improve access to internal web information such as webbased portals and business applications such as oracle and sap and streaming media 

 

on june 22 2006 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with blue coat systems inc to sell certain assets of the netcache business see note 16 to the consolidated financials statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k

seasonality 

 

although operating results have not been materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality 

 

see “risk factors — factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and “risk factors — risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results” accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

 

network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues 

 

competition 

 

the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 

 

in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hds hp ibm and sun microsystems we also see dell inc as an emerging competitor in the storage marketplace primarily due to a business partnership that has been established between dell and emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp dot hill systems corporation and xiotech corporation in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems as a result of their acquisition of storagetek technology corporation our nearstore vtl appliances also compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space 

 

in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies on june 22 2006 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with blue coat systems inc to sell certain assets of the netcache business see note 16 to the consolidated financials statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline and vtl storage markets and the caching and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support 

 

see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results” and “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance”

we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance name and logo data ontap datafabric faserver ®  filerview nearstore netapp netcache secureshare snapmanager snapmirror snaprestore snaplock snapvault wafl and others as trademarks in the united states other us trademarks and some of the other us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 

see “risk factors — if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating results” 

 

environmental disclosure 

 

various federal state and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in our manufacturing failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions we believe we are fully compliant with all applicable environmental laws see “risk factors — our business is subject to changing laws and regulations environmental legislation” accompanying this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate which could adversely impact our common stock price 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following 

 

 19 

 

  

in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be different from what we forecast we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 

 

we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted towards the backend of the quarter if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets our financial results will be adversely impacted 

 

due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change if our new products do not achieve market acceptance or if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however our new products may not achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact our sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new 

products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

 

an increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 

 

in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc hds hp ibm and sun microsystems we also see dell inc as an emerging competitor in the storage marketplace primarily due to a business partnership that has been established between dell and emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp dot hill systems corporation and xiotech corporation in the secondary storage market which includes the disktodisk backup compliance and business continuity segments our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems as a result of their acquisition of storagetek technology corporation our nearstore vtl appliances also compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space 

 

in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems on june 22 2006 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with blue coat systems inc to sell certain assets of the netcache business see note 16 to the consolidated financials statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies 

 

additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline and vtl storage markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

 

we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and global service and support we must continue to maintain and enhance this technological advantage over our competitors if those competitors with greater financial marketing service support technical and other resources were able to offer products that matched or surpassed the technological capabilities of our products these competitors would by virtue of their greater resources gain a competitive advantage over us that could lead to greater sales for these competitors at the expense of our own market share which would have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increased competition could also result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized in the assembly of our products we purchase our disk drives through several suppliers we purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including 

 

  

component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current prospective customers and suppliers 

 

in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that is incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 

 

the loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

 

we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products our reliance on our thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results as of april 30 2006 we have no purchase commitment under these agreements 

 

we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the inability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets if these markets do not continue to grow at the rates at which we forecast growth our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

 

all of our products address the storage and data management markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 

 

for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceuticals and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and therefore we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast 

 

in addition our business also depends on general economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the storage and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product and service solutions and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 

 

we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our storage systems as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages may be negatively affected 

 

our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including 

 

 23 

 

  

changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as continued investments in our customer support infrastructure changes in the mix between technical support services and professional services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

 

our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate we have been notified of examinations in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions the rights to some of our intellectual property “ip” is owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip recently some other companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of an examination our management does not believe based upon information currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we may incur problems with current or future acquisitions and equity investments and these investments may not achieve our objectives 

 

as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities 

acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value integration risks and issues may include but not limited to key personnel retention and assimilation management distraction technical development and unexpected costs and liabilities including goodwill impairment charges in addition we may be unable to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

 

from time to time we also make equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives we have already made strategic investments in a number of storage and data managementrelated technology companies equity investments may result in the loss of investment capital the market price and valuation of our equity investments in these companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over which we have little or no control to the extent that the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended period of time our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted 

 

we cannot assure you that our oem relationship with ibm will generate significant revenue 

 

in april 2005 we announced a strategic partner relationship with ibm as part of the relationship we entered into an original equipment manufacturing oem agreement that enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on network appliance unified and open network attached storage nas and iscsiip san solutions including nearstore and the netapp vseries systems as well as associated software offerings while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time and therefore we cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in future years in addition we have no control over the products ibm selects to sell their release schedule and timing of those products nor do we control their pricing revenues from the ibm relationship were not significant during fiscal 2006 and accounted for approximately 10 of our total consolidated revenue in the event that sales through ibm were to gain significant traction we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners if we fail to minimize channel conflicts our operating results and financial condition could be harmed in addition since this agreement is relatively new we do not have a history upon which to base our analysis of its future success 

 

currently we do not and cannot assure you that this oem relationship will generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners our revenue may be impacted negatively 

 

an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors we have significant partner relationships with database business application and backup management companies including microsoft oracle sap and symantec a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

 

we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on the progress of our new products under development with that partner 

we are expanding our indirect channel we cannot assure you that we are able to maintain existing resellers attract new resellers and that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships in addition we do not have exclusive relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as valueadded resellers or vars systems integrators distributors oems and strategic business partners and derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners in fiscal 2006 fujitsu siemens and our twotier distribution partners arrow and avnet accounted for 42 and 106 respectively of our consolidated revenue 

 

however in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenue as we have forecasted we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to do so we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products however because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners at the same time our indirect channel partners may offer products that are competitive to ours in addition because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing sales and support of our competitors’ products than ours if we fail to manage effectively our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our products we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue as we have forecasted which would have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively or if our resellers’ financial conditions or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we conduct business internationally for the year ended april 30 2006 457 of our total revenues were from international customers including us exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 

 

our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 

 

we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our nonus customers these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing 

law or regulations potentially adverse tax consequences could negatively impact the operating and financial results from international operations international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands 

 

although operating results have not been materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by seasonality 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

if we fail to manage our expanding business effectively our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we experienced growth in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 our future operating results depend to a large extent on management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth including but not limited to expanding international operations forecasting revenues addressing new markets controlling expenses implementing and enhancing infrastructure systems and processes and managing our assets 

 

the growth in our business requires that we invest in people processes and systems to best optimize our revenue growth and long term profitability however growth in our sales or continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management financial manufacturing and other systems and may require us to implement and improve those systems if we experience any problems with any improvement or expansion of these systems procedures or controls or if these systems procedures or controls are not designed implemented or improved in a costeffective and timely manner our operations may be materially and adversely affected in addition any failure to implement improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

in addition an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed which could materially and adversely affect our net income 

 

our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner 

 

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 

 

the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 27 

 

  

in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

we depend on the ability of our personnel raw materials equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 

 

any political military world health eg sars avian flu or other issue which hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions furthermore any strike economic failure or other material disruption cased by fire floods hurricanes power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology or directly impact our marketing manufacturing financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

 

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education backgrounds and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

undetected software hardware errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

 

our products may contain undetected software hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some us trademarks and some usregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure 

you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 

 

litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure accounting and tax requirements and environmental legislation that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

 

because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

 

we have recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 30 2006 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 

 

the impact of option expensing under sfas no 123r will result in lower reported earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price this could also impact our ability to use or our future practice of utilizing broadbased employee stock plans to attract reward and retain employees which could also adversely impact our operations in addition the option pricing models used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options are based on highly subjective inputs and assumptions if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated securities class action litigation could be brought against us or the market price of our common stock could decline or both could occur as a result we could incur significant losses and our operating results may be below our expectations and those of investors and stock market analysts 

 

we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our products the european union “eu” has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu one of these is the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 

“rohs” directive the rohs directive restricts the use of lead mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july 1 2006 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial costs including excess component inventory and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition we will need to ensure that we can manufacture compliant products and that we can be assured a supply of compliant components from suppliers similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions including in the united states china and japan other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and become an important customer for us however government demand is unpredictable and there is no guarantee of future revenue growth from the us government 

 

the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending on infrastructures if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern our financial results may be harmed we cannot assure you that revenue from the us government will continue to grow in the future

overview 

 

enterprises are generating vast quantities of data the rapidly growing amount of data a company generates and the requirements to retain data for longer periods of time are driving an increasing demand for storage and data management solutions there is an increase in demand for online access to historical information for business or regulatory requirements the growth in storage capacity requirements further increases the complexity of data management managing the continued growth in the volume of data and the ondemand information access continue to challenge our enterprise customers companies are looking for solutions to help simplify data storage it administration and reduce total costs of ownership companies are migrating toward modular unified storage systems away from large fixed expensive frameclass arrays and inefficient directattached storage there is a growing trend toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage pool 

 

in recent years enterprises have centralized terabytes of data into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs higher utilization and simplified management on the other hand geopolitical events such as september 11 2001 natural disasters such as the katrina hurricane disaster government regulations such as securities and exchange commission’s “sec” rule 17a4 banking regulations such as basel ii increased privacy concerns such as laptop thefts with sensitive data and industry guidelines such as pci payment card industry standard put forth by visa and mastercard have all put a spotlight on the need to protect and retain data for both the public and private sector consolidation coupled with a higher probability of disasters has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss and its disruptive impact on the business at the same time compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to retain data for long periods of time as well as secure data at rest data protection and retention have become a critical it priorities requiring costeffective storage solutions that can help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business disruption at an affordable cost 

 

we believe that our strategic investments are targeted at some of the strongest growth areas of the storage market such as modular storage data protection data retention data security iscsi and grid computing however if any storage market trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated our business could be materially adversely affected the fiscal 2006 revenue growth and increased gross margins have occurred while the market for our storage products and solutions has grown more competitive with downward pricing pressures that could negatively impact our future revenue growth rate and our future gross margins at the same time we anticipate and continue to experience further price decline per petabyte for our products which may have an adverse impact on our future gross margins if not offset by favorable software mix and higher average selling prices associated with new products we expect our future gross margins to be negatively affected by factors such as global service investment cost competition indirect sales including oem high disk content partially offset by new product introductions and enhancements and product and addon software mix 

 

continued revenue growth is dependent on the introduction and market acceptance of our new products in fiscal 2007 we expect to ship our new highend products launch our nextgeneration operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality and offer a comprehensive suite of data protection solutions if we fail to timely deliver new products or successfully integrate acquired technology into our existing architecture or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance or if there is no or reduced demand for these or our current products we may experience a decline in revenue additionally we plan to invest in the people processes and systems necessary to best optimize our revenue growth and longterm profitability however we cannot assure you that such investments will achieve our financial objectives 

fiscal 2006 highlights 

 

in fiscal 2006 we continued to enhance our enterprise solutions broaden our customer portfolio extend our channelpartner opportunities build additional infrastructure to manage our growth and broaden our total addressable market during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we acquired decru inc that develops and sells encryption software and appliances which offers data protection solutions for enterprises and governments including regulatory compliance privacy secure consolidation and outsourcing we believe that the current and future potential for this technology will enable us to help our customers manage their risk of data theft and corruption with data encryption and authentication products some of the key fiscal 2006 highlights included 

 

penetrated in enterprise data centers and expanded our breadth of disktodisk backup and security solutions we achieved revenue growth and profitability in fiscal 2006 driven primarily by our new fas3000 midrange product line for the first time customers can choose to purchase fibre channel andor lowercost ata drives on the same system combined with our patented raiddp protection and our flexvol and flexclone technologies the fas3000 allows more costeffective “ata” drives to be used safely in primary storage applications which offers the best priceperformance value to our customers we expect our data center penetration will win more nearstore deployments as customers choose netapp data production solutions to back up their mission critical systems during fiscal 2006 we introduced an array of products technologies and services that highlight the broad range of netapp disktodisk backup and security solutions which simplify data backup procedures improve recoverability and lower backup infrastructure expenses we believe that our new nearstore virtual tape library solution will further expand our market opportunity as we can now provide disktodisk backup solutions for all open systems enterprise primary storage 

 

extended our channelpartner opportunities we continued to make progress in penetrating and expanding our business in enterprise data centers with mission critical partners our fiscal 2006 channel mix demonstrated increased expansion through our partner programs with approximately 555 of our business coming through indirect channels and the remaining 445 coming through direct sales the majority of our blockbased storage business and the us federal business came from indirect channels higher growth rates in our indirect channels demonstrated our increasing leverage giving us broader market reach and increasing enterprise penetration 

 

expanded our global services and support it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a global comprehensive endtoend suite of worldclass service and support solutions designed to help our customers meet their goals of simplifying their storage solutions we increased our business with our top enterprise customers who typically purchase more complete and longerterm service packages the growth in service revenue in fiscal 2006 was also driven by increases in professional services we expect to continue to expand our global services and support and believe that such investments will help accelerate the adoption rate of our technology we cannot assure you that service revenue will continue to grow at previous rates we expect to invest in our services infrastructure commensurate with our revenue growth 

 

broadened our total addressable market and extended our product lines into adjacent spaces we have brought a more comprehensive set of products to the market place with the new high end offering next generation operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality the disktodisk backup solution on the vtl space the decru security and encryption solutions and in early fiscal 2007 our entry into the smalltomedium businesses we also continued to broaden our addressable market by increasing our focus on the vseries product line which uses virtualization to let customers take advantage of the management simplicity of netapp data ontap with their storage from other vendors 

 

fiscal 2006 financial performance 

 

 35 

 

  

critical accounting estimates and policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

 

we believe that the following accounting policies are “critical” as defined by the securities and exchange commission in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain we also have other important policies including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective these policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

 

we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations

revenue recognition and allowances 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and related interpretations to our product sales because we believe our firmware and operating software are essential to the functionality of our hardware products we recognize revenue when 

 

  

for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method when all of the undelivered elements are softwarerelated this allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items when the undelivered elements include nonsoftware related items that are only sold as a bundle with software related items this allocation is based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” “eitf 0021” we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately if vendor specific evidence cannot be obtained to determine fair value of the undelivered elements revenue from the entire arrangement would be deferred and recognized as these elements are delivered this would have a material effect on the timing of product revenues 

 

a typical arrangement includes product software subscription and maintenance some arrangements include technical consulting and training software subscriptions represent the right to unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases service maintenance includes contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance revenue from software subscriptions and service maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term generally one to three years we typically sell technical consulting services and training separately from any of our other revenue elements either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects the type of work that is performed is not essential to the functionality of the software or hardware accordingly we recognize revenue as the services are performed and in accordance with eitf 0305 “applicability of aicpa statement of position 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software” revenue from hardware installation services is a nonsoftware deliverable because the software is not essential to the functionality of the installation service and is therefore outside of the scope of sop 972 revenue from shipping and handling is included in product revenue and its related cost included in cost of product revenue 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns changes in customer demand current trends and our expectations regarding future experience reductions to revenue associated with sales returns include consideration of historical sales levels the timing and magnitude of historical sales returns and a projection of this experience into the future we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimate by reviewing actual returns and adjust it for future expectations to 

determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience and expectation additional allowances may be required 

 

we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected we monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts as of april 30 2006 was 24 million compared to 54 million as of april 30 2005 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

 

identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our gross and operating margins 

 

under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required in fiscal 2006 and 2005 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment however any future writedowns of goodwill would adversely affect our operating margins as of april 30 2006 our assets included 4875 million in goodwill see note 14 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during fiscal 2006 we adjusted goodwill by 35 million and 21 million relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed spinnaker and decru options respectively estimated future adjustments to goodwill related to the tax benefits associated with subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed options by previous acquisitions are approximately 84 million subject to future cancellations relating to employee terminations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the us earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the us and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international business in addition a 

decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international business or in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate 

 

while most of our profits are earned in foreign jurisdictions with income tax rates generally lower than the combined us federal and state income tax rates judgment must be made with respect to other estimates of income tax provision such as rd tax credits and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets primarily those set up for net operating losses and income tax credits 

 

the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets which consists primarily of the reversal of net deductible temporary differences including credits and net operating loss carryforwards assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these tax attributes if we do not generate sufficient future income the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense we have provided a valuation allowance of 4312 million as of april 30 2006 on the deferred tax attributes associated with the exercise of employee stock options primarily credits and net operating loss carryforwards because of uncertainty regarding their realization due to the expectation that future employee stock option exercises will reduce our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in the event these attributes are realized the associated tax benefit will be credited to stockholders’ equity rather than as a reduction in the income tax provision 

 

prior to fiscal year 2006 our current effective tax rate assumed that us income taxes were not provided for undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries however pursuant to the onetime incentive created under section 965 of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” our foreign subsidiaries remitted approximately 4055 million in accumulated earned income on which we incurred approximately 225 million in federal and state income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 in fiscal 2004 we recorded an income tax benefit of 168 million associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling this favorable ruling from the netherlands provided for retroactive benefits dating back to fiscal year 2001 and continuing until december 31 2005 subsequent to our fiscal 2005 year end we obtained a new tax ruling from the netherlands which terminated the first ruling and provides for continuing favorable tax rate benefits until april 30 2010 as of april 30 2006 our netherlands subsidiary had a conditional royalty expense carryforward of 517 million that may become available for offset against future dutch income the carryforward may not however be used to offset income under the new dutch tax ruling expiring april 30 2010 we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for this carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be able to utilize this attribute 

 

we have been notified of examinations in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions our management does not believe based upon information currently known to it that the final resolution of any of these audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations however if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our overall effective tax rate may be adversely impacted 

 

beginning with the fiscal year 2007 implementation of sfas no 123r we may experience adverse impacts to future years effective tax rates in the event that we determine that our apic pool as of the beginning of fiscal year 2007 is not sufficient enough to cover the impacts of future stock compensation shortfalls 

 

inventory writedowns 

 

our inventories net balance was 645 million as of april 30 2006 compared with 390 million as of april 30 2005 inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or market we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margins in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold 

we record purchase commitment liabilities with our contract manufacturers and suppliers as a result of changes in demand forecasts or as we transition our products as of april 30 2006 we do not have purchase commitment under such arrangements 

 

we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture we will continue to monitor our environmental compliance and could incur higher costs including additional reserves for excess component inventory 

 

restructuring accruals 

 

in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and a consolidation of our facilities in fiscal 2006 we implemented the third restructuring plan related to the move of our global service center operations in determining restructuring charges we analyze our future business requirements in order to properly align and manage our business commensurate with our future revenue levels 

 

our restructuring costs and any resulting accruals involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made some of which may be provided by third parties in recording severance reserves we accrue a liability when the following conditions have been met employees’ rights to receive compensation is attributable to employees’ services already rendered the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate payment of the compensation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in recording facilities lease restructuring reserve we make various assumptions including the time period over which the facilities are expected to be vacant expected sublease terms expected sublease rates anticipated future operating expenses and expected future use of the facilities 

 

our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above if actual results differ significantly from our estimates we may be required to adjust our restructuring and lease loss accruals in the future in fiscal 2005 we estimated our facility restructuring reserve to be 45 million our fiscal 2006 estimate for the facility restructuring reserve was 27 million which included a 10 million adjustment due to the execution of new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility net of related cost 

 

impairment losses on investments 

 

as of april 30 2006 our shortterm investments have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value there have been no significant declines in fair value of investments that are considered to be otherthantemporary for any of the three years in the period ended april 30 2006 the fair value of our availableforsale investment reflected in the consolidated balance sheets was 11028 million and 9764 million as of april 30 2006 and 2005 respectively we have not identified any of these declines to be other than temporary as market declines of our investments have been caused by interest rate changes and were not due to credit worthiness because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes we have no impairment losses on our availableforsale investment or investment in privately held companies for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

all of our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be 

otherthantemporary this determination requires significant judgment for publicly traded investments impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time including factors such as current economic and market conditions the credit rating of the security’s issuer the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value and our ability to hold investments to maturity if an investment’s decline in fair value caused by factors other than changes in interest rates is deemed to be otherthantemporary we would reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values our investments in privately held companies were 110 million and 18 million as of april 30 2006 and 2005 respectively for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires the identification of events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment including revenue and earnings trends overall business prospects limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities and general market conditions in the investees’ industry 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

we adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 123 as amended by sfas no 148 and provide pro forma disclosure using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected life and forfeiture rate we are currently evaluating the expected volatility rates in accordance with sab no 107 including the use of historical blended and implied volatility as of may 1 2006 the contractual life of our stock options has been shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’ exercise behavior it may change the expected term of an option going forward sfas no 123r will require us to include estimated forfeitures and therefore the required adoption of sfas no 123r could have a material impact on the timing of and based on the accuracy of estimates of future actual forfeiters the amount stock compensation expense any changes in these highly objective assumptions may significantly impact the stock compensation expenses for the future 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” see discussion under new accounting standards below in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” sab 107 includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 123r we will apply the principles of sab 107 in conjunction with our adoption of sfas no 123r in our first quarter of fiscal 2007 which begins on may 1 2006 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in november 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position fsp 1151 which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether that impairment is otherthantemporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments the guidance in this fsp amends statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” the guidance in fsp 1151 shall be applied to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 we are required to adopt fsp 1151 for fiscal years beginning after may 1 2006 we are 

currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp 1151 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact 

 

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “sfas no 154” accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 20 “apb 20” and fasb statement no 3 sfas no 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used sfas no 154’s retrospectiveapplication requirement replaces apb 20’s requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity this statement also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error the requirements are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and will only impact the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made 

 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “ inventory costs” sfas no 151 this statement amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas no 151 are effective for inventory cost incurred in fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 as such we are required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2007 which begins on may 1 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r generally the requirements of sfas no 123r are similar to those of sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires companies to now recognize all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the payments pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is the first quarter of fiscal 2007 which begins on may 1 2006 

 

in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” sfas no 123r see discussion below in particular sab no 107 provides key guidance related to valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term the accounting for income tax effects of sharebased payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no 123r the modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the classification of compensation expense capitalization of compensation cost related to sharebased payment arrangements firsttime adoption of sfas no 123r in an interim period and disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r3 transition election and accounting for tax effects the guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the additional paidin capital apic pool for beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the adoption of sfas no 123r beginning on may 1 2006 in addition this fsp addresses that when the alternative apic pool calculation is used tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows the fsp allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of sfas no 123r or november 10 2005 to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a onetime election we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance 

 

sfas no 123r and its related guidance permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method or modified retrospective method we plan to adopt sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and 

b based on the requirements of sfas no 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r that remain unvested on the effective date we will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stockbased awards issued after april 30 2006 on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award for stockbased awards issued prior to may 1 2006 we amortized the related compensation costs using the gradedvesting method 

 

as permitted by sfas no 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using the apb 25 intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options as grant date value equals fair value the adoption of the sfas no 123r fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations because the stockbased compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings the pretax balance of unearned stockbased compensation to be expensed in the period fiscal 2007 through 2010 related to sharebased awards unvested as of april 30 2006 as previously calculated under the disclosureonly requirements of sfas no 123 is approximately 2405 million if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned stockbased compensation expense to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions our stockbased compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions we anticipate that we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in fiscal 2007 the fair value of these grants cannot be predicted with certainty at this time due to the fact that the expense amount will depend on the timing of new grants the number of new grants changes in the market price or the volatility of our common stock however we currently estimate that the impact on our first fiscal quarter will be between 007 — 009 per share as of may 1 2006 the contractual life of our stock options has been shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’ exercise behavior it may change the expected term of an option going forward we are not aware of any other changes in business practices and do not expect any violations of debt covenants due to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 43 

 

 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

 

product revenues  — product revenues increased by 251 to 15774 million in fiscal 2006 from 12606 million in fiscal 2005 product revenues growth was across all geographies this net increase year over year was specifically attributable to increased software licenses an increase in units shipped and an increase in demand for data protection and missioncritical storage environments partially offset by a decline in shipments and lower average selling prices of older generation products lower costpermegabyte disks our systems are highly configurable because of customer requirements in the open systems storage markets we serve as a result the wide variation in customized configuration can significantly impact revenue cost of revenues and gross margin performance price changes volumes and product model mix can have an effect on changes in product revenues the impact on these forces is significantly affected by the configuration of systems shipped 

 

product revenues were favorably affected by the following factors 

 

  

product revenues were negatively affected by the following factors 

 

 44 

 

the decru acquisition and the ibm oem relationship did not have a significant impact on the revenue for fiscal 2006 there can be no assurance that ibm and decru will contribute meaningful revenue in future quarters we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products 

 

software subscriptions revenues  — software subscriptions revenues increased by 409 to 2391 million in fiscal 2006 from 1697 million in fiscal 2005 due primarily to a larger installed base renewals upgrades and an increasing number of new enterprise customers software subscriptions revenues represent 116 and 106 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 489 to 2499 million in fiscal 2006 from 1678 million in fiscal 2005 

 

the increase in absolute dollars was due to the following factors 

 

  

while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solution we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2007 

 

a large portion of our service revenues is deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years and are classified as shortterm and longterm deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets service revenues represented 121 and 105 of total revenues for fiscal year 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

international total revenues  — international total revenues including us exports increased by 232 in fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 international total revenues were 9438 million or 457 of total revenues for fiscal year 2006 compared with 7658 million or 479 of total revenues for fiscal 2005 the increase in international sales was primarily a result of revenue growth from our european and asia pacific geographies driven by increased demand for our solutions portfolio new customers and higher storage spending in certain geographic regions as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2007 

 

product gross margins  — product gross margins decreased to 605 for fiscal 2006 from 614 for fiscal 2005 

 

product gross margins were negatively affected by the following factors 

 

  

product gross margins were favorably affected by the following factors 

 

 45 

 

we expect higher disk content associated with highend storage systems will negatively affect our gross margins in the future if not offset by software revenue and new products 

 

amortization of existing technology from acquisitions included in cost of product revenues was 118 million and 34 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of product revenues relating to acquisitions will be 155 million for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008 147 million for fiscal year 2009 103 million for fiscal year 2010 28 million for fiscal year 2011 and none thereafter 

 

software subscriptions gross margins  — software subscriptions gross margins increased slightly to 994 for fiscal 2006 from 991 for fiscal 2005 due primarily to improved headcount utilization and a larger installed base renewals upgrades and an increasing number of new enterprise customers 

 

service gross margins  — service gross margins increased to 259 in fiscal 2006 compared to 194 in fiscal 2005 cost of service revenue increased by 369 to 1850 million in fiscal 2006 from 1352 million in fiscal 2005 

 

the improvement in service gross margins for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in services revenue and improved headcount utilization offset by the continued spending in our service infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer base this spending included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs service gross margins will typically experience some variability over time due to the timing of technical support service initiations renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure in fiscal 2007 we expect service gross margins to be in the mid 20 range as we continue to build out our service capability and capacity to support our growing enterprise customers and new products our fiscal 2007 total gross margin will also be negatively impacted by stock compensation expenses as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 277 to 5952 million for fiscal 2006 from 4660 million for fiscal 2005 these expenses were 289 and 291 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively the increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability higher partner program expenses and the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions 

 

amortization of acquisitionsrelated trademarkstradenames and customer contracts and relationships included in sales and marketing expenses was 21 million and 08 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively estimated future amortization of trademarks tradenames customer contracts and relationships relating to acquisitions and included in sales and marketing expenses will be 23 million for fiscal 2007 22 million for fiscal 2008 2009 and 2010 13 million for fiscal 2011 and 03 million thereafter 

 

sales and marketing headcount increased to 1927 at april 30 2006 from 1918 at april 30 2005 we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce new products establish and expand new distribution channels and increase product and company awareness our sales and market expenses will also increase as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth 

 

research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges fees paid to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents 

 

research and development expenses increased 421 to 2430 million for fiscal 2006 from 1710 million for fiscal 2005 these expenses represented 118 and 107 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased headcount ongoing operating impact of the acquisitions ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts and higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability research and development 

headcount increased to 1246 as of april 30 2006 compared to 827 as of april 30 2005 for both fiscal 2006 and 2005 no software development costs were capitalized 

 

included in research and development expenses is amortization of acquired patents of 20 million and 18 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively based on acquired patents existing at april 30 2006 estimated future capitalized patents amortization expenses will be 20 million for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008 respectively and 05 and 02 million for fiscal 2009 and 2010 

 

we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we expect to continuously support current and future product development and enhancement efforts and incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies we intend to continuously broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio 

 

we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2007 primarily due to ongoing costs associated with the development of new products and technologies projected headcount growth the operating impact of potential future acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2006 and stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses increased 194 to 919 million for fiscal 2006 from 769 million for fiscal 2005 these expenses represented 44 and 48 of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively this increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to expenses associated with expanded regulatory requirements higher legal expenses and professional fees for general corporate matters including patents and higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability 

 

general and administrative headcount increased to 568 at april 30 2006 from 331 at april 30 2005 we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2007 due to projected ga headcount growth and the stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r amortization of acquisitionsrelated covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expenses was 22 million and 51 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively estimated future amortization of covenants not to compete relating to acquisitions will be 10 million for fiscal year 2007 and 02 million in fiscal year 2008 

 

inprocess research and development  — we recorded inprocess research and development charges of 50 million in fiscal 2006 related to the acquisition of decru the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition approximately 50 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting future net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur research and development costs to bring the products from decru to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial conditions 

 

stock compensation  — stock compensation expenses were 133 million and 81 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively this net increase in yearoveryear stock compensation expenses reflected primarily higher stock compensation relating to stock options and restricted stocks assumed in acquisitions and restricted stock awards partially offset by forfeitures of unvested options and forfeited restricted stock assumed in the acquisitions based on deferred stock compensation recorded at april 30 2006 estimated future deferred stock compensation amortization expenses excluding the impact of sfas no 123r are 203 million in fiscal 2007 143 million in fiscal 2008 81 million in fiscal 2009 and 66 million in fiscal 2010

restructuring liability for the first restructuring the second restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we implemented a third restructuring plan related to the move of our global services center operations from sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our research triangle park facility in north carolina 

 

our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in previous management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in fiscal 2006 we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of 13 million resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our tewksbury facility in fiscal 2006 we recorded a restructuring charge of 11 million primarily attributed to severancerelated amounts and relocation expenses related to the third restructuring plan 

 

of the reserve balance at april 30 2006 09 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 21 million was classified as longterm obligations the balance of the reserve is expected to be paid by fiscal 2011

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations and other commercial commitments stock repurchase program capital commitments other sources and uses of cash flows and tax opportunities on our liquidity and capital resources 

 

balance sheet and other cash flows 

 

as of april 30 2006 compared to april 30 2005 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 1529 million to 13229 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations and from working capital working capital increased by 603 million to 11160 million as of april 30 2006 compared to 10557 million as of april 30 2005 

 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded cash flows from operating activities of 5543 million as compared with 4621 million and 3130 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively the largest driver of this increase was fiscal 2006 net income of 2665 million as compared to 2258 million and 1521 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively noncash adjustments were higher in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 including depreciation which was higher by 92 million due to worldwide facilities expansion amortization of intangible assets which was higher by 68 million stock compensation which was higher by 51 million and acquired inprocess research and development of 50 million the increase in these acquisitionrelated noncash charges was related to the decru and alacritus acquisitions during fiscal 2006 in addition to higher net income and noncash adjustments in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 the primary factors that impacted the periodtoperiod change in cash flows relating to operating activities included the following 

 

  

the above factors were partially offset by the effects of the following 

 

  

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 

 

cash used in investing activities was 3260 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 3513 million and 2598 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 were 1329 million compared to 936 million and 487 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively we used net proceeds of 1285 million 2668 million and 1917 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively for net purchasesredemptions of shortterm investments in fiscal 2006 we acquired alacritus and decru and incurred total cash 

payments including related transactions costs totaling 537 million in fiscal 2004 we incurred 80 million on related transactions costs and assumed 12 million relating to the spinnaker acquisition in fiscal 2005 and 2004 we acquired additional patents for a purchase price of approximately 09 million and 90 million respectively investing activities in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 also included new investments in privately held companies of 93 million 04 million and 09 million respectively we received 01 million 03 million and 11 million in proceeds from sales of investments in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively under a split dollar insurance arrangement with our ceo entered in may 2000 we paid total premiums of 102 million including 02 million and 39 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively in april 2005 our ceo reimbursed us 102 million for these premiums 

 

cash provided by financing activities was 428 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 121 million and 546 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we repurchased 174 million 77 million and 69 million shares of common stock at a total of 4889 million 1929 million and 1362 million respectively other financing activities provided 2327 million 1819 million and 815 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively which related to sales of common stock from employee stock transactions pursuant to the provisions of our stock option plans we allowed optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have us withhold from the shares to be issued upon exercise of a restricted stock the equivalent shares having a fair market value equal to 11 million in withholding taxes in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 to cover for federal state and local withholding taxes during fiscal 2006 we borrowed 3000 million to fund the repatriation in cash from foreign earnings and investments under the jobs act 

 

the change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the effects of higher common stock repurchases partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee programs compared to the same periods in the prior year net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flows resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

through april 30 2006 the board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 6500 million in shares of our outstanding common stock at april 30 2006 4057 million remained available for future repurchases the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

 

other sources and uses of cash and tax opportunities 

 

the jobs act created a onetime incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividendreceived deduction for certain dividends from certain nonus subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repatriated 4055 million of accumulated foreign earnings and recorded a 225 million federal and state income tax liability upon the remittance of these foreign earnings 

 

for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we recorded tax benefits in the form of reduced payments of 422 million 278 million and 495 million respectively associated with disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options if stock option exercise patterns change we may receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not receive the same level of tax benefits in the future which could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase 

 

debt 

 

in march 2006 we received proceeds of the term loans totaling 3000 million to finance a dividend under the jobs act see note 6 the loan repayments of 1662 million and 1338 million are due in fiscal 2007 and 2008 respectively this debt was collateralized by restricted investments totaling 2412 million as well as certain foreign receivables in accordance with the payment terms of the loan agreement interest payments will be approximately 124 million and 41 million in fiscal 2007 and 2008 respectively as of april 30 2006 we are in compliance with the liquidity and leverage ratio as required by the loan agreement with the lenders 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments 

 

the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at april 30 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

 

 

for purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable legally binding on us and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table

capital expenditure requirements 

 

we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future consistent with the growth in our business as we continue to invest in people land buildings capital equipment and enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california rtp north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed we expect to finance these construction projects including our commitments under facilities and equipment operating leases and any required capital expenditures over the next few years through cash from operations and existing cash cash equivalents and investments 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of april 30 2006 our financial guarantees of 18 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program and a foreign lease 

 

as of april 30 2006 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 3451 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for 

speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid 

 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 of fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” see “guarantees” in footnote 15 for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

 

we have commitments related to a lease arrangement with bnp for approximately 190000 square feet of office space to be located on land currently owned by us in sunnyvale california as further described above under “contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments” we have evaluated our accounting for this lease under the provisions of fin 46r and have determined the following 

 

  

accordingly under the current fin 46r standard we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the bnp lease assuming this transaction will continue to meet the provisions of fin 46r as new standards evolve over time our future minimum lease payments under this real estates lease will amount to a total of 435 million reported under our note 4 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

as of april 30 2006 except for operating leases and other contractual obligations outlined under the “contractual cash obligations” table we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we also do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

 

key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories and future demand for our products and related pricing we expect to incur higher capital expenditures in the near future to expand our operations we will from time to time acquire products and businesses complementary to our business in the future we may continue to repurchase our common stock which would reduce cash cash equivalents andor shortterm investments available to fund future operations and meet other liquidity requirements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases contractual obligations and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for 

speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies 

 

market interest and interest income risk 

 

interest and investment income  — as of april 30 2006 we had availableforsale investments of 11028 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as available for sale these highly liquid investments consisting primarily of government municipal corporate debt and auctionrate securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2006 would cause the fair value of these shortterm investments to decline by approximately 35 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

lease commitments  — as of april 30 2006 we have arrangements with bnp to lease our land for a period of 50 years to construct approximately 190000 square feet of office space costing up to 385 million after completion of construction we will pay minimum lease payments which vary based on london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread we expect to pay lease payments on the completed buildings from bnp on september 2007 for a term of five years we have the option to renew the lease for two consecutive fiveyear periods upon approval by bnp a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2006 would increase our total lease payments under the initial 5year term by approximately 09 million we do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases as cash from operating cash flows are invested in a higher interest rate environment it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a significant increase in market interest rate 

 

debt obligation  — we have an outstanding variable rate term loan totaling 3000 million as of april 30 2006 under terms of these arrangements we expect to pay interest payments at libor plus a spread due to the shortterm nature of these debt arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows over the next two fiscal years we do not currently use derivatives to manage interest rate risk 

 

equity securities  — we have from time to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be successful accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 110 million as of april 30 2006 and 18 million as of april 30 2005 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 for cash flow hedges outstanding at april 30 2006 the gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income 

we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that network appliance inc and its subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of april 30 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinions

manufacturing 

  manufacturing operations with insourced and outsourced locations in sunnyvale california san jose california and livingston scotland include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control final test and global logistics we rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems we multisource wherever possible to mitigate supply risk our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy 

  see “risk factors — we rely on a limited number of suppliers” and “risk factors — the loss of our contract manufacturers” this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investment and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded the iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 iso 90012000 certification on december 3 2003 and continue to be iso 90012000 certified we were awarded iso 14001 certification on december 8 2004

customer base 

  our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments and vertical markets examples include 

 17  seasonality 

  although operating results have not been materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality 

  see “risk factors — factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and “risk factors — risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results” accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

18 backlog 

  network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues 

competition 

  the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 

  in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we also see dell inc as an emerging competitor in the storage marketplace primarily due to a business partnership that has been established between dell and emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp storagetek technology corporation dot hill systems corporation and xiotech corporation in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and storagetek our nearstore appliances also compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space 

  in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies 

  additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline storage market and the caching and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support 

  see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results” and “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance”

risk factors 

  the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following 

 21 

   in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 

  the majority of revenue in any given quarter is derived from orders booked in the same quarter bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted towards the backend of the quarter if bookings in the latter part of a quarter are not achieved there is a potential impact to revenue 

  due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 

  in the storage market our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we also see dell inc as an emerging competitor in the storage marketplace primarily due to a business partnership that has been established between dell and emc allowing dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp storagetek technology corporation dot hill systems corporation and xiotech corporation in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and storagetek our nearstore appliances also compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space 

  in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies 

  additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline storage market and the caching and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future 

  we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and global service and support we must continue to maintain and enhance this 

22 technological advantage over our competitors otherwise if those competitors with greater financial marketing service support technical and other resources were able to offer products that matched or surpassed the technological capabilities of our products these competitors would by virtue of these greater resources gain a competitive advantage over us that could lead to greater sales for these competitors at the expense of our own market share which would have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  increased competition could also result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially adversely affect our operating results 

   we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized in the assembly of our products we purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier we purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including 

   component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that is incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 

   we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products our reliance on our thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to 

23 risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results as of april 30 2005 we have no purchase commitment under these agreements 

  we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the inability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

   all of our products address the storage and content delivery markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 

  for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceuticals and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and therefore we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast 

  in addition our business also depends on general economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for network storage and content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage and content delivery market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the network storage and content delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

   our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and internet caching devices and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however we cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact our sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we 

24 are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  in particular in conjunction with the introduction of our product offerings in the fabricattached storage market we introduced products with new features and functionality that address the storage area network market we face risks relating to these product introductions including risks relating to forecasting of demand for such products as well as possible product and software defects and a potentially different sales and support environment associated with selling these new systems if any of the foregoing occurs our operating results could be adversely affected 

  as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

   we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our storage systems as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages may be negatively affected 

  our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including 

   changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as continued investments in our customer support infrastructure changes in the mix between technical support services and professional services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

   as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities see note 11 — business combinations and note 15 — subsequent events we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities 

25   acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value integration risks and issues may include but not limited to key personnel retention and assimilation management distraction technical development and unexpected costs and liabilities including goodwill impairment charges in addition we may experience a diversion of management’s attention the loss of key employees of acquired operations or the inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

  from time to time we make equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives we have already made strategic investments in a number of network storagerelated technology companies equity investments may result in the loss of investment capital the market price and valuation of our equity investments in these companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over which we have little or no control to the extent that the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended period of time our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted in fiscal 2003 we recorded noncash writedowns of 20 million related to the impairment of our investment in publicly traded and private companies as its reduction in value was judged to be otherthantemporary 

   in an effort to gain market share and support our global customers we will need to expand our worldwide direct sales operations and global service and support infrastructure to support new and existing enterprise customers expansion of our direct sales operations resellerdistribution channels and global service and support operations may not be successfully implemented and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues generated 

  we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as valueadded resellers “vars” systems integrators distributors and strategic business partners and derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners however in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenue as we have forecasted we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to do so we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products however because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners at the same time our indirect channel partners may develop and offer products of their own that are competitive to ours or because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing sales and support of our competitors’ products than ours if we fail to manage effectively our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our products we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue as we have forecasted which would have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively or if our resellers’ financial conditions or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

   we conduct business internationally for fiscal year 2005 479 of our total revenues was from international customers including us exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially 

26 adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 

  our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flow all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 

  potentially adverse tax consequences could also negatively impact the operating and financial results from international operations international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands 

  additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 

  although operating results have not been materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality 

  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

   an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

  we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on the progress of our new products under development with that partner 

   our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner 

   we have experienced growth in fiscal 2005 and 2004 our future operating results depend to a large extent on management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth including but not limited to expanding international operations forecasting revenues addressing new markets controlling expenses implementing infrastructure and systems and managing our assets in addition an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially adversely affect our operating results 

   the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to 

   in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

   our operations including our suppliers’ and contract manufacturers’ operations are susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired 

  weak economic conditions or terrorist actions could lead to significant business interruptions if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information 

28 technology or direct impacts on our marketing manufacturing financial functions or our suppliers’ logistics function our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

   our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education backgrounds and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

   our products may contain undetected software hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

   our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some us trademarks and some usregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business 

  litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

  we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or 

29 licensing agreements any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

   because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and nasdaq have implemented new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

  we have recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april 30 2005 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 

  we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our products the european union “eu” has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu the first of these is the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive which directs eu member states to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and environmentally sound disposal of products placed on the market after august 13 2005 and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced the eu has also adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive the rohs directive restricts the use of lead mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july 1 2006 

  similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions including in the united states china and japan other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

   in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r revised 2004 which will require us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to expense employee stock options for financial reporting purposes adoption of sfas no 123r will result in lower reported earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price in addition this could also impact our ability or future practice of utilizing broadbased employee stock plans to attract reward and retain employees which could also adversely impact our operations 

  in addition the fasb requires certain valuation models to estimate the fair value of employee stock options these models including the blackscholes optionpricing model use varying methods inputs and assumptions selected across companies if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated securities class action litigation could be brought against us or the market price of our 

30 common stock could decline or both could occur as a result of these changes we could incur losses and our operating results and gross margins may be below our expectations and those of investors and stock market analysts 

   the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending on infrastructures if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern our financial results may be harmed we cannot assure you that revenue from the us government will continue to grow in the future

 item 2 properties tableend   our headquarters site for corporate general administration sales and marketing research and development global services and manufacturing operations is located in sunnyvale california we own and occupy approximately 800000 square feet of space in buildings at our sunnyvale headquarters during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we purchased three buildings in research triangle park “rtp” north carolina for 241 million these buildings are being renovated and will be used primarily for global service support research and development and other functions 

  we lease other sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the united states and internationally we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california rtp north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed 

  as a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal 2002 we have exited office space under a noncancellable lease in the united states if we are unable to successfully sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space our operating results may be adversely affected see “note 12 under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements”

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference 

overview 

  enterprises are generating vast quantities of data the rapidly growing amount of data a company generates and the requirements to retain data for longer periods of time are driving an increasing demand for storage solutions there is an increase in demand for online access to historical information for business or regulatory requirements the growth in storage capacity requirements further increases the complexity of data management companies are looking for storage solutions to help simplify data storage and reduce total costs of ownership companies are migrating toward modular unified storage systems away from large fixed expensive mainframeclass arrays and inefficient directattached storage there is a growing trend toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage pool we believe that our strategic investments are targeted at some of the strongest growth areas of the storage market such as modular storage data protection iscsi and grid computing however if any storage market trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated our business could be materially adversely affected 

  over the course of the last several years we believe that the overall global economy has continued to strengthen and it spending has also improved although we expect our revenue to grow in fiscal 2006 we cannot assure you that the storage market will continue to improve or that we will be successful in capitalizing on this improvement the fiscal 2005 revenue growth and increased gross margin have occurred while the 

33 market for our storage products and solutions has grown more competitive with downward pricing pressures that could negatively impact our future revenue growth rate and our future gross margin at the same time we anticipate and continue to experience further price decline per petabyte for our products which may have an adverse impact on our future gross margin if not offset by favorable software mix and higher average selling prices associated with new products we expect our future gross margin to be negatively affected by factors such as global service investment cost competition partially offset by new product introductions and enhancements and product and addon software mix during fiscal 2005 there were industrywide constraints affecting the supply of enterprise class hard disk drives “hdd” we have secured commitments from our hard disk drive suppliers sufficient to meet our expected requirements and there has been no material impact on our business in fiscal 2005 however we remain exposed to risk should there be global industrywide shortages affecting all suppliers we believe that the hdd market supply and demand have regained their balance however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of all our components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase component price increases and supplier capacity constraints over time may negatively affect gross margin in the future 

  continued revenue growth is dependent on the introduction and market acceptance of our new products in fiscal 2006 we expect to refresh our product line deliver our nextgeneration operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality and offer a comprehensive suite of data protection solutions if we fail to timely introduce new products or successfully integrate acquired technology into our existing architecture or if there is no or reduced demand for these or our current products we may experience a decline in revenue additionally we plan to invest in the people processes and systems necessary to best optimize our revenue growth and longterm profitability however we cannot assure you that such investments will achieve our financial objectives 

   in fiscal 2005 we continued to enhance our enterprise solutions broaden our customer portfolio extend our channelpartner opportunities and gain market share with our nas iscsi san unified storage and nearstore solutions we also continued to win enterprise customers in our target industries with our storage and data management solutions our vision is to simplify the data management challenges our customers face through costeffective innovative storage solutions some of the key fiscal 2005 highlights included

 35  critical accounting estimates and policies 

  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances however actual future results may vary from our estimates 

  we believe that the following accounting policies are “critical” as defined by the securities and exchange commission in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain we also have other important policies including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective these policies are discussed in the note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form 10k 

  we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

 

   we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and related interpretations to all transactions that generate revenue we recognize revenue when 

 36    for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 

  a typical arrangement includes product software subscription and maintenance some arrangements include training and consulting software subscriptions include unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases and are included in product revenues service maintenance includes contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance revenue from software subscriptions and service maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term generally one to three years revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 

  we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment these estimates are based on historical sales returns changes in customer demand and other factors if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

  we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

   we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire companies the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired including identifiable intangible assets with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill goodwill and purchased intangible assets include existing technology patents trademarks customer contracts and covenants not to compete identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our gross and operating margins 

  we evaluate the impairment of goodwill and purchased indefinite life intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us 

37 to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets actual results may vary from our expectations 

  under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist accordingly goodwill recorded in business combinations may significantly affect our future operating results to the extent impaired but the magnitude and timing of any such impairment is uncertain when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different from management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required in fiscal 2005 and 2004 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment however any future writedowns of goodwill would adversely affect our operating margin as of april 30 2005 our assets included 2918 million in goodwill related to the acquisitions of orca webmanage and spinnaker see note 13 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements 

   the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the us earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the us and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international business in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international business or in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate also our current effective tax rate assumes that us income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the us in fiscal 2004 we recorded a nonrecurring income tax benefit of 168 million associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling this favorable ruling from the netherlands provided for retroactive benefits dating back to fiscal year 2001 and continuing until december 31 2005 subsequent to our fiscal 2005 year end we obtained a new tax ruling from the netherlands which terminated the first ruling and provides for continuing favorable tax rate benefits until april 30 2010 

  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets which consists primarily of the reversal of net deductible temporary differences including credits and net operating loss carryforwards assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these tax attributes if we do not generate sufficient future income the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense we have provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax attributes associated with the exercise of employee stock options primarily credits and net operating loss carryforwards because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation of future employee stock option exercises if these attributes are realized the associated tax benefit will be credited to stockholders’ equity rather than as a reduction in the income tax provision 

  the american jobs creation act of 2004 “the jobs act” creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividendreceived deduction for certain dividends from certain nonus subsidiaries the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and we are currently considering recently issued treasury and irs guidance on the application of the deduction we are not yet in a position to decide whether and to what extent foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us might be repatriated based on the analysis to date however it is reasonably possible that as much as 3550 million might be repatriated with a respective tax liability of up to 150 million we expect to be in a position to finalize our analysis during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 

   we write down inventory and record purchase commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margin in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold 

  we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

   in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and a consolidation of our facilities these restructuring accruals were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring”  and included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates future restructurings will be accounted for under sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which superceded eitf no 943 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

   we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment as of april 30 2005 our shortterm investments have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value there have been no significant declines in fair value of investments that are considered to be otherthantemporary under the eitf no 0301 for any of the three years in the period ended april 30 2005 our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and the decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities 

   we adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 123 as amended by sfas no 148 and provide pro forma disclosure using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations the blackscholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility we use projected volatility rates which are based upon historical volatility rates since our initial public offering trended into future years 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” see discussion under new accounting standards 

39 below in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” sab 107 includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of fas 123r we will apply the principles of sab 107 in conjunction with our adoption of fas 123r in our first quarter of fiscal 2007 which begins on may 1 2006 

   we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

   in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” “sfas no 151” this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas no 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 as such we are required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” that addresses the accounting for sharebased payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments the statement eliminates the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board or apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options we currently use the blackscholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than results from the use of the blackscholes option pricing model in addition there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatments than currently required these differences include but are not limited to the accounting for the tax benefits on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption methods under the retroactive method prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas 123r while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2007 which begins on may 1 2006 

  upon adoption this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements because we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained 

40 herein the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of fas 123r compensation expense calculated under fas 123r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors in addition upon adoption of fas 123r we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 

  in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” sab 107 includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of fas 123r we will apply the principles of sab 107 in conjunction with our adoption of fas 123r 

  in january 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fas 1091 “application of sfas no 109 to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” this fsp provides guidance for the accounting of a deduction provided to us manufacturing companies and is effective immediately we believe the adoption of this position currently will not have a material effect of its financial position or results of operations however there is no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the american jobs creation act introduces a special onetime dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to us companies provided certain criteria are met fsp no 1092 provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the impact of the repatriation provision on a company’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability we are currently studying the impact of the onetime favorable foreign dividend provision and intend to complete the analysis during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 accordingly we have not adjusted income tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the tax impact of any repatriation of nonus earnings 

results of operations 

  the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 

 41    the following table presents the components of revenues stated as a percentage of total revenues 

 fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

  product revenues  — product revenues increased by 352 to 14303 million in fiscal 2005 from 10582 million in fiscal 2004 product revenues growth was across all geographies this increase in product revenues was specifically attributable to increased software licenses and software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped compared to the same period in the previous year 

  product revenues were favorably affected by the following factors 

   product revenues were negatively affected by the following factors 

 42   the spinnaker acquisition which closed in february 2004 did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2005 revenue we expect to release spinnaker integrated capabilities at the end of calendar year 2005 we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products 

  service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 497 to 1678 million in fiscal 2005 from 1121 million in fiscal 2004 

  the increase in absolute dollars was due to the following factors 

   while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solution we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2006 

  service revenues are generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years service revenues represented 105 and 96 of total revenues for fiscal year 2005 and 2004 respectively

  product gross margin  — product gross margin increased to 659 for fiscal 2005 from 649 for fiscal 2004 

  product gross margin was favorably affected by the following factors

  the improvement in service gross margin for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to an increase in services revenue and improved headcount utilization offset by the continued spending in our service infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer base this spending included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs service gross margin will typically experience some variability over time due to the timing of technical support service initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure in fiscal 2006 we expect service margin to be in the low 20 range as we continue to build out our service capability and capacity to support our growing enterprise customers and new products 

  sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 333 to 4660 million for fiscal 2005 from 3495 million for fiscal 2004 these expenses were 291 and 299 of total revenues for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively the increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues higher performancebased payroll expenses due to higher profitability higher sales kickoff expenses higher partner program expenses and the continued worldwide spending in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions partially offset by an extra week of business in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2005

46   other income expense net  — other income expense net included net exchange losses from foreign currency transactions of 16 million and 29 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively the net exchange loss was a result of the volatility of the currency exchange market and increased hedging costs associated with our forward and option activities 

  provision for income taxes  — for fiscal 2005 we had an effective tax rate of 183 to pretax income the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to a foreign tax ruling for our principal european subsidiary the availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2004 our effective tax rate was 108 which included 99 reduction to account for the 168 million nonrecurring benefit from the retroactive portion of foreign tax ruling

47 higher service revenues were also related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers 

  international total revenues  — international total revenues including us exports increased by 469 in fiscal year 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 international total revenues were 5510 million or 471 of total revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared with 3752 million or 421 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 the increase in international sales for fiscal year 2004 was primarily a result of european and asia pacific net revenues growth driven by larger storage implementations new products and higher storage spending in certain geographic regions compared to the previous fiscal year

  stock compensation  — stock compensation expenses were 39 million and 36 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively this net increase in stock compensation expenses reflected primarily higher stock compensation relating to the spinnaker acquisition and restricted stock awards offset by forfeitures of unvested options assumed in the spinnaker and webmanage acquisitions 

  restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and consolidations of our facilities

  the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2004 in thousands 

   interest income  — during fiscal 2004 interest income was 137 million compared to 122 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher cash and investment balances provided by operating activities partially offset by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio 

  other expenses net  — other expenses net included a net exchange loss from foreign currency transactions of 29 million and 10 million respectively for fiscal 2004 and 2003 the increase in net exchange loss was attributed to the impact of currency balance sheet hedging activities resulting from forecast variances

  for fiscal 2004 we had an effective tax rate of 108 which included 99 reduction to account for the 168 million nonrecurring benefit from the foreign tax ruling the effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive and current benefits of the foreign tax ruling the availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2003 our effective tax rate was 218 which included certain benefits from tax credits and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction 

50 liquidity and capital resources 

  the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flow contractual obligations and other commercial commitments stock repurchase program capital commitments other sources and uses of cash flow and potential tax opportunities on our liquidity and capital resources 

   as of april 30 2005 compared to april 30 2004 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 3620 million to 11700 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital working capital increased by 3107 million to 10557 million as of april 30 2005 compared to 7450 million as of april 30 2004 

  during fiscal 2005 we recorded cash flows from operating activities of 4621 million as compared with 3130 million and 1924 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively the largest driver of this increase was fiscal 2005 net income of 2258 million as compared to 1521 million and 765 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively noncash adjustments were higher in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 including amortization of intangible assets which was higher by 44 million and stock compensation which was higher by 43 million all relating to the spinnaker acquisition in addition to higher net income and noncash adjustments in fiscal 2005 the primary factors that impacted the periodtoperiod change in cash flows relating to operating activities included the following 

   the above factors were partially offset by the effects of the following 

   we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results shipment linearity accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 

  capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 were 936 million which included the 241 million site purchase in research triangle park rtp north carolina compared to 487 million and 602 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively we used net proceeds of 2668 million 1917 million and 2000 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively for net purchasesredemptions of shortterm investments in fiscal 2005 and 2004 we acquired additional patents for a purchase price of approximately 09 million and 90 million respectively investing activities in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 also included new investments in privately held companies of 04 million and 09 million and 07 million respectively we received 03 million 11 million and 08 million in proceeds from sales of investments in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively under a split dollar insurance arrangement with our ceo entered in may 2000 we paid total premiums of 102 million including 02 million 39 million and 20 million for fiscal years 2005 

51 2004 and 2003 respectively in april 2005 our ceo reimbursed us 102 million for these premiums in fiscal 2004 we incurred 80 million on a bridge loan and related transactions costs and assumed 12 million relating to the spinnaker acquisition 

  we used 121 million and 546 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively and received 293 million in fiscal 2003 in net financing activities which included sales of common stock related to employee stock transactions net of common stock repurchases during fiscal 2005 and 2004 we repurchased 77 million and 69 million shares of common stock at a total of 1929 million and 1362 million respectively other financing activities provided 1819 million 815 million and 293 million in the fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively which related to sales of common stock related to employee stock transactions during fiscal 2005 pursuant to the provisions of our stock option plans we allowed optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have us withhold from the shares to be issued upon exercise of a restricted stock the equivalent shares having a fair market value equal to 11 million withholding taxes to cover for federal state and local withholding taxes 

  the change in cash flow from financing was primarily due to the effects of higher common stock repurchases partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee programs compared to the same period in the prior year net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock as a result our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 

   in fiscal 2005 our board of directors approved an increase in shares authorized to be repurchased from 1500 million to 3500 million in common shares on may 24 2005 the board authorized an expansion of the program to purchase an additional 3000 million of outstanding common stock the duration of the repurchase program is openended and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time share repurchase activities for fiscal 2005 and 2004 were as follows in thousands 

   since the inception of the stock repurchase program through april 30 2005 we have purchased a total of 146 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2259 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 3291 million at april 30 2005 209 million in shares remained authorized for repurchases under the plan 

   the american jobs creation act of 2004 “the jobs act” creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividendreceived deduction for certain dividends from certain nonus subsidiaries the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and we are currently considering recently issued treasury and irs guidance on the application of the deduction we are not yet in a position to decide whether and to what extent foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us might be repatriated based on the analysis to date however it is reasonably possible that as much as 3550 million might be repatriated with a respective tax liability of up to 150 million we expect to be in a position to finalize our analysis during our third quarter of fiscal 2006 

  for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we recorded tax benefits in the form of reduced payments of 278 million 495 million and 185 million respectively associated with disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options if stock option exercise patterns change we may receive less cash from stock option 

52 exercises and may not receive the same level of tax benefits in the future which could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase 

   the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at april 30 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 

   for purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable legally binding on us and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement some of the figures we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal or termination anticipated actions by third parties and other factors because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table

   we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future consistent with the growth in our business as we continue to invest in people land buildings capital equipment and enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure we expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale california rtp north carolina and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we purchased three buildings in rtp north carolina for 241 million we expect to finance these construction projects including our commitments under facilities and equipment operating leases and any required capital expenditures over the next few years through cash from operations and existing cash cash equivalents and investments 

   as of april 30 2005 our financial guarantees of 18 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation a customs guarantee a corporate credit card program and a foreign lease 

  as of april 30 2005 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 2111 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid 

  we offer both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing arrangements to our customers under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing company in the event that any customers were to default we initially defer 100 of the recourse lease receivable and recognize revenue over the term of the lease as the lease payments become due as of april 30 2005 and 2004 the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled approximately 7047 and 6755 respectively under the terms of the nonrecourse leases we do not have any continuing obligations or liabilities to date we have not experienced significant losses under this lease financing program 

54   we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 of fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” see “guarantees” in footnote 14 for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

  as of april 30 2005 except for operating leases and other contractual obligations outlined under the “contractual cash obligations” table we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we also do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

   key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital in particular accounts receivable and inventories and future demand for our products and related pricing we expect to incur higher capital expenditures in the near future to expand our operations we will from time to time acquire products and businesses complementary to our business in the future we may continue to repurchase our common stock which would reduce cash cash equivalents andor shortterm investments available to fund future operations and meet other liquidity requirements based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures stock repurchases contractual obligations and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next 12 months

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

  we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and

although operating results have not been materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality see “risk factors — factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and “risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results” accompanying this annual report on form 10k sales and marketing   network appliance markets and distributes products globally in over 100 countries employing a multichannel distribution strategy which focuses on product sales to end users through a direct sales force valueadded resellers system integrators original equipment manufacturers “oems” and distributors in north america we employ all forms of distribution previously mentioned with a focus on direct sales to our strategic and named accounts in europe we employ a mix of resellers and direct sales channels to sell to end users in asia africa and south america our products are primarily sold through resellers which are supported by channel sales representatives and technical support personnel no single customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales in fiscal 2004 2003 or 2002 backlog   network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues manufacturing   manufacturing operations with insourced and outsourced locations in sunnyvale california san jose california and livingston scotland include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control and final test we rely on many suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint qualitytraining programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy see “risk factors — we rely on a limited number of suppliers” and “risk factors — the loss of our contract manufacturers” this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investment and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded the iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 iso 90012000 on december 3 2003 and continue to be iso 90012000 certified research and development   during fiscal year 2004 network appliance strengthened the unified storage platform product line to support both san and nas simultaneously we introduced a number of new systems including the fas250 and fas270 filers the fas980 highend filers the netcache c6200 and the nearstore r200 which continues to define a new category of storage solution the gfiler for hitachi has been extended and the product line now also includes ibm storage support we also introduced newer versions of existing software products that continue to improve data management capabilities provide new solutions in the areas of data protection and backup and recovery and enable new business continuance functionality we have also 16 strengthened our engineering partnerships and collaboration with veritas brocade mcdata hitachi data systems “hds” and others we completed our acquisition of spinnaker networks inc “spinnaker” in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which will accelerate the delivery of the netapp storage grid architecture enabling customers to obtain more value from their storage and data infrastructures 

  see “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected” competition   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology   in the storage market our fas appliances and associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including dell engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp storagetek technology corporation silicon graphics inc and xiotech corporation in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and storagetek our nearstore appliances also compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline storage market and the caching and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support   see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results” and “if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance” proprietary rights   we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance name and logo datafabric faserver filerview nearstore netapp netcache secureshare snapmanager snapmirror snaprestore and wafl and others as trademarks in the us other us trademarks and some of the other us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued see “risk factors — if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating results” 17 employees   as of april 30 2004 we had 2844 employees of the total 1421 were in sales and marketing 650 in research and development 331 in finance and administration and 442 in

   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following  19    in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer   due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

   we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our filers and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer products as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages may be negatively affected   our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including  20    changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as continued investments in our customer support infrastructure changes in the mix between technical support services and professional services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

 

   our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner 

 

   we have experienced growth in fiscal 2004 our future operating results depend to a large extent on management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth including but not limited to expanding international operations forecasting revenues addressing new markets controlling expenses implementing infrastructure and systems and managing our assets in addition an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   all of our products address the storage and content delivery markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend   for example we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services healthcare pharmaceuticals and government market segments industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access reliability and permanence such as rule 17a4 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products and therefore we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast   in addition our business also depends on general economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for network storage and content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending have resulted in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage and content delivery market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the network storage and content delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially adversely affected 21 

 

   the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include    in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

   our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and internet caching devices and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however we cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact our sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected   in particular in conjunction with the introduction of our product offerings in the fabricattached storage market we introduced products with new features and functionality that address the storage area network market during fiscal 2003 we introduced iscsienabled unified storage solutions we also introduced direct access file system “dafs” protocolcapable products and nearstore backup and recovery products during fiscal 2002 we face risks relating to these product introductions including risks relating to forecasting of demand for such products as well as possible product and software defects and a potentially different sales and support environment associated with selling these new systems if any of the foregoing occur our operating results could be adversely affected   as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 22 

 

   our operations including our suppliers’ and contract manufacturers’ operations are susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired   weak economic conditions or terrorist actions could lead to significant business interruptions if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or direct impacts on our marketing manufacturing financial functions or our suppliers’ logistics function our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

   our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education backgrounds and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we conduct business internationally for fiscal year 2004 approximately 471 of our total revenues was from international customers including us exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts   our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flow all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income these hedges attempt to reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results   additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results   potentially adverse tax consequences could also negatively impact the operating and financial results from international operations international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands the dutch tax ruling however will expire at the end of calendar 2005 there are uncertainties associated with securing a new dutch tax ruling 23   additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results   although operating results have not been materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality   we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology   in the storage market our fas appliances and associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including dell engenio information technologies inc formerly the storage systems group of lsi logic corp storagetek technology corporation silicon graphics inc and xiotech corporation in the nearline storage market which includes the disktodisk backup and regulated data storage segments our nearstore appliances compete primarily against products from emc and storagetek our nearstore appliances also compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backuprecovery space   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc our netcache business is also subject to indirect competition from content delivery service products such as those offered by akamai technologies   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets the nearline storage market and the caching and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future   we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and global service and support to date we have been able to compete successfully with our principal competitors in large part based on the product benefits that we believe result from the superior technology of our products we must continue to maintain and enhance this technological advantage over our competitors otherwise if those competitors with greater financial marketing service support technical and other resources were able to offer products that matched or surpassed the technological capabilities of our products these competitors would by virtue of these greater resources gain a competitive advantage over us that could lead to greater sales for these competitors at the expense of our own market share which would have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations   increased competition could also result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially adversely affect our operating results 24 

 

   we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized in the assembly of our products we purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier we purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including    component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and for semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers   in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that is incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 

 

   we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products our reliance on our thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results as of april 30 2004 we have no such purchase commitment   we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the inability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 25 

 

   an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products with these vendors a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time   we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on the progress of our new products under development with that partner 

 

   from time to time we make equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives we have already made strategic investments in a number of network storagerelated technology companies equity investments may result in the loss of investment capital the market price and valuation of our equity investments in these companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over which we have little or no control to the extent that the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended period of time our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted in fiscal 2003 and 2002 we recorded noncash writedowns of 20 million and 130 million respectively related to the impairment of our investment in publicly traded and private companies as its reduction in value was judged to be otherthantemporary in fiscal 2004 and 2003 we recorded a gain of 07 million and 08 million respectively related to sales of previously impaired investments   as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we have acquired three companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001 including the acquisition of spinnaker networks inc for approximately 3060 million we completed the spinnaker acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and have completed integrating the acquired operations and products from this acquisition into our operations see note 11 — business combinations we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities   acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value in addition we may experience a diversion of management’s attention the loss of key employees of acquired operations or the inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation   in addition we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairmentonly approach as of april 30 2004 the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying amount and no impairment was recognized on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise there had been no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 26 

 

   we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as valueadded resellers “vars” systems integrators distributors and strategic business partners and derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners however in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenue as we have forecasted we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to do so we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products however because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners at the same time our indirect channel partners may develop and offer products of their own that are competitive to ours or because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing sales and support of our competitors’ products than ours if we fail to manage effectively our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our products we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue as we have forecasted which would have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   our products may contain undetected software hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to establish policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies essential to preparing our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual future results may differ materially from these estimates we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions in addition see our critical accounting estimates and policies under item 7 

 

   our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some us trademarks and some usregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and 27 international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business 

  litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours   we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 








 item 2 properties tableend   our headquarters site for corporate general administration sales and marketing research and development global services and manufacturing operations occupies approximately 800000 square feet of buildings in sunnyvale california   we lease other sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the us and internationally we believe that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed   as a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal 2002 we have exited office space under noncancellable leases in both the us and europe if we are unable to successfully sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space our operating results may be adversely affected see “note 12 under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements”   see additional discussion regarding properties in “note 4 under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 


 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 


 item 4 submissions of matters to a vote of security holders tableend   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on form 10k 28 

part ii 


 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters tableend   our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on november 21 1995 and is traded under the symbol “ntap” as of april 30 2004 there were 1217 holders of record of the common stock the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market    we believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly see “item 1 business — risk factors”   we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate retaining all available funds if any to finance internal growth and product development as well as other management initiatives including stock repurchases and acquisitions payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time   information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference from our proxy statement for the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders   on february 18 2004 we acquired spinnaker networks inc “spinnaker” for approximately 3055 million including transaction costs of 30 million in an all stock transaction through the merger of nagano sub inc a wholly owned subsidiary of network appliance with and into spinnaker the “merger” with spinnaker to survive as the whollyowned subsidiary of network appliance under terms of the agreement we acquired spinnaker for 124 million shares of common stock and assumed options to purchase 29 million shares of common stock in connection with the spinnaker 2000 option plan we relied on an exemption under section 3a10 of the securities act in issuing the unregistered securities to the stockholders of spinnaker on march 1 2004 we filed a form s8 registration statement with the sec to register the assumed options of the spinnaker 2000 stock plan repurchases of common stock   on may 13 2003 we announced that the board of directors approved a 1500 million stock repurchase program to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 69 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1362 million the repurchases were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity on may 18 2004 we announced that the board authorized an expansion of the program to purchase an additional 2000 million of outstanding common stock total authorized stock purchase spending may be up to 3500 million the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time the duration of the repurchase program is openended under the program network appliance inc may purchase shares of common stock through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management the timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this program will depend on market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 29 the purchases will be funded from available working capital the following table sets forth common stock repurchases by network appliance for the periods indicated 

 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference overview   enterprises are generating vast quantities of data the volume of stored data is growing due to increased digital content online transaction processing and large databases the growth of ebusiness and the requirements to retain data for longer periods of time is driving an increasing demand for storage and data management solutions there is an increasing need to maintain easy access to historical information for business or regulatory requirements many companies want all data to be available online rather than archived offline 30   while the quantity of online data continues to grow the price of storage and storage networking hardware continues to decline data growth is outpacing it spending growth companies are migrating towards modular scalable systems rather than large fixed frame systems companies are looking for storage systems with data management software to help simplify data storage and reduce the total cost of ownership the growth in storage capacity further increases the complexity of data management there is a growing trend toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage pool   while we believe that these trends have favorably impacted our business there is no assurance that the aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our expected financial objectives in fiscal 2004 although the data storage market experienced growth and improved it spending many of our customers remain cautious about their spending and many of our competitors continue to struggle financially we believe economic conditions have improved but are uncertain as to the duration and strength of the economic recovery   overall our revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by a combination of new product innovation additional channelpartner opportunities and improving it spending however we cannot assure you that revenue from our storage and data management solutions will continue to grow at previous rates we also expect to experience further price decline per petabyte for our products which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin if not offset by favorable software mix and higher average selling prices associated with new products we continue to expect our gross margin to be impacted by factors such as new product introductions and enhancements addon software and product mix discount level competition and global service investment   we also cannot assure you that our new products will be introduced in a timely manner to capitalize on these trends if we fail to respond to certain significant market trends or if any market trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated our business could be materially adversely affected additionally we plan to invest more resources in the people and programs necessary to best optimize these growth opportunities however we cannot assure you that such investments will achieve our objectives see “risk factors” under item 1 fiscal 2004 highlights   in fiscal 2004 we continue to enhance our enterprise solutions broaden our customer portfolio extend our channelpartner opportunities and gain market share with our iscsi unified storage and nearstore solutions we also continue to win enterprise customers across all target industries with our storage and data management solutions   our goal is to provide network storage solutions and service offerings that set the standard for simplicity and ease of operation with what we believe to be one of the lowest total costs of ownership some of the key fiscal 2004 highlights include  31  critical accounting estimates and policies   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates and judgments including those related to sales returns bad debts goodwill and intangibles income taxes excess inventory and purchase commitments investments intangible assets lease losses and restructuring accruals stockbased compensation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates   we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations  

 

   we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and related interpretations to all transactions that generate revenue we recognize revenue when  32    for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately   a typical arrangement includes product software subscription and maintenance some arrangements include training and consulting software subscriptions include unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases and are included in product revenues service maintenance includes contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized ratably over the contractual term generally one to three years revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed   we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment these estimates are based on historical sales returns changes in customer demand and other factors if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required   we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

 

   we record intangible assets when we acquire companies the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired including identifiable intangible assets with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill goodwill and purchased intangible assets include existing workforce existing technology patents trademarks customer contracts and covenants not to compete identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time while inprocess research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized subject to periodic review for impairment accordingly the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets should conditions be different than management’s current assessment material writedowns of the fair value of intangible assets may be required we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a writedown in future periods as such any future writedowns of these assets would adversely affect our gross and operating margins   we evaluate the impairment of goodwill and purchased indefinite life intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic 33 trends restructuring actions lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization evaluations of possible impairment and if applicable adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate among other factors future cash flows useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets actual results may vary from our expectations 

  under our accounting policy we will perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators of impairment exist accordingly goodwill recorded in business combinations may significantly affect our future operating results to the extent impaired but the magnitude and timing of any such impairment is uncertain when we conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill as of february 27 2004 or if in the interim impairment indicators are identified with respect to goodwill the fair value of goodwill is reassessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment should conditions be different than management’s last assessment significant writedowns of goodwill may be required in fiscal 2004 and 2003 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment goodwill as of april 30 2004 is 2918 million and any future writedowns of goodwill would adversely affect our operating margin see note 13 — goodwill and purchased intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements 

 

   the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the us earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the us and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international business in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international business or in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate also our current effective tax rate assumes that us income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the us in fiscal 2004 we recorded a nonrecurring income tax benefit of 168 million associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 this favorable ruling from the netherlands provides for retroactive benefits dating back to fiscal year 2001 as well as current and future tax rate benefits during fiscal 2004 we received tax refunds that relate to prior years’ tax payments   the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets which consists primarily of the reversal of net deductible temporary differences including credits and net operating loss carryforwards assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these tax attributes if we do not generate sufficient future income the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense we have provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax attributes associated with the exercise of employee stock options primarily credits and net operating loss carryforwards because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation of future employee stock option exercises if these attributes are realized the associated tax benefit will be credited to stockholders’ equity rather than as a reduction in the income tax provision 

 

   we write down inventory and record purchase commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margin in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold 34   we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

 

   in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and a consolidation of our facilities these restructuring accruals were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring”  and included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates future restructuring will be accounted for under sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which superceded eitf no 943 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

   we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment as of april 30 2004 our shortterm investments have been classified as “availableforsale” and are carried at fair value there have been no significant decline in fair value of investments that are considered to be otherthantemporary under the eitf no 0301 for any of the three years in the period ended april 30 2004 our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities in fiscal 2004 we recorded a gain of 07 million related to sales of previously impaired investments during fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash writedown of 20 million related to impairments of our investments as their reduction in value was judged to be otherthantemporary during fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to the impairment of our investment in publicly traded and nonpubliclytraded companies 

 

   we adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 123 as amended by sfas no 148 and provided pro forma disclosure using the blackscholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model and is not subject to revaluation as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations the blackscholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility we use projected volatility rates which are based upon historical volatility rates since our initial public offering trended into future years because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 

 

   we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability 35 to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

new accounting standards   in december 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenuegenerating activities in some arrangements the different revenuegenerating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is there are separate units of accounting in other arrangements some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately this issue addresses when and if so how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations   the fasb issued fin no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” in january 2003 and a revised interpretation of fin 46 “fin 46r” in december 2003 fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities “vies” to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties the provisions of fin 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 since january 31 2003 the company has not invested in any entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the company is the primary beneficiary for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 the company is required to continue to apply fin 46 through april 30 2004 the company is required to adopt the provisions of fin 46r for those arrangements on may 1 2004 for arrangements entered into prior to february 1 2003 the company is required to adopt the provisions of fin 46r on may 1 2004 the company does not expect the adoption of fin 46r to have an impact on the financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of sfas no 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 in particular this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative it also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flow   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which requires that certain financial instruments be presented as liabilities that were previously presented as equity or as temporary equity such instruments include mandatory redeemable preferred and common stock and certain options and warrants sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 in november 2003 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 1503 effective date disclosures and transition for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests under sfas no 150  which defers the effective date for various provisions of sfas no 150 as of april 30 2004 we had no financial instruments within the scope of this pronouncement   in november 2003 the eitf reached an interim consensus on issue 0301 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” to require additional disclosure 36 requirements for securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 those additional disclosures have been incorporated into the accompanying footnotes in march 2004 the eitf reached a final consensus on this issue to provide additional guidance which companies must follow in determining whether investment securities have an impairment which should be considered otherthantemporary the guidance is applicable for reporting periods after june 15 2004 the company does not believe that adoption of the disclosure requirements under the interim consensus would have had a significant impact on the carrying value of its investments at april 30 2004 the company will continue to monitor the carrying value of its investments under this new guidance in fiscal 2005 

results of operations   the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003   business combinations  — during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we acquired spinnaker for approximately 3056 million including estimated transaction costs in an allstock transaction through the merger of nagano sub inc a wholly owned subsidiary of network appliance with and into spinnaker the 37 “merger” with spinnaker to survive as the wholly owned subsidiary of network appliance spinnaker provides scalable system architectures distributed file systems nextgeneration clustering technologies and virtualization the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction the unaudited pro forma information giving pro forma effect to the merger is presented under note 11 — notes to consolidated financial statements 

  product revenues  — product revenues increased by 319 to 10582 million in fiscal 2004 from 8023 million in fiscal 2003 product revenues growth was across all geographies this increase in product revenues was specifically attributable to increased software licenses and software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped as compared to the prior year   product revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors    product revenues were negatively impacted by the following factors    the acquisition of spinnaker in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2004 revenues we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products   service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 249 to 1121 million in fiscal 2004 from 898 million in fiscal 2003 service revenues are generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service obligation periods which are typically one to three years service revenues represented 96 and 101 of total revenues for fiscal year 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increasing number of enterprise customers which typically purchase more complete and generally longerterm service packages higher service revenues were also related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solution we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2005   international total revenues  — international total revenues including us exports increased by 469 in fiscal year 2004 compared fiscal 2003 international total revenues were 5510 million or 471 of total revenues for fiscal year 2004 the increase in international sales for fiscal year 2004 was primarily a result of european and asia pacific net revenues growth driven by larger storage implementations new products and higher storage spending in certain geographic regions as compared to the prior fiscal year we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2005 38   product gross margin  — product gross margin decreased to 649 for fiscal 2004 from 651 for the fiscal 2003 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was 37 million and 55 million for fiscal year 2004 and 2003 respectively estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of product revenues relating to the spinnaker acquisition will be 34 million for each of fiscal year 2005 2006 2007 2008 27 million for fiscal year 2009 and none thereafter   product gross margin was negatively impacted by    product gross margin was favorably impacted by    service gross margin  — service gross margin decreased to 159 in fiscal 2004 as compared to 265 in fiscal 2003 investments in global service increased by 430 to 943 million in fiscal 2004 from 660 million in fiscal 2003 the decrease in service gross margin was primarily due to the continued investment in our service infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer base partially offset by improved headcount utilization these investments included additional professional support engineers increased support center activities and global service partnership programs service gross margin will typically experience some variability over time due to the timing of technical support service initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure we expect service margin to improve as we begin to see service revenue growth and improved headcount utilization partially offset by major investments in headcount and logistics as we continue to build out our service capability and capacity   sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain global service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 149 to 3495 million for fiscal 2004 from 3042 million for fiscal 2003 these expenses were 299 and 342 of total revenues for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively the increase in absolute dollars was attributed to sales kickoff and club meetings increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions and scaling our sales infrastructure offset by cost controls and reduction in discretionary spending efforts amortization of spinnaker trademarkstradenames and customer contractsrelationships included in sales and marketing expenses was 02 million for fiscal year 2004 and none in 2003 respectively estimated future amortization of trademarks tradenames customer contracts and relationships relating to the spinnaker acquisition will be 08 million and 03 million for fiscal year 2005 and 2006 respectively and none thereafter   sales and marketing headcount increased to 1421 at april 30 2004 from 1199 at april 30 2003 we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets 39 introduce new products establish and expand new distribution channels and increase product and company awareness we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth 

  research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges fees paid to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents included in research and development expenses are capitalized patents amortization of 15 million for april 30 2004 as compared to none for the same periods in the prior year estimated future capitalized patents amortization expenses will be 18 million for each of the fiscal years 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 and 03 million thereafter   research and development expenses increased 168 to 1319 million for fiscal 2004 from 1129 million for fiscal 2003 these expenses represented 113 and 127 of total revenues for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 increased ongoing operating impact of the spinnaker acquisition increased headcount ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges offset by cost controls and reduction in discretionary spending efforts research and development headcount increased to 650 as of april 30 2004 compared to 526 as of april 30 2003 for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 no software development costs were capitalized   we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we expect to continuously support current and future product development and enhancement efforts and incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies we intend to continuously broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio   we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2005 primarily due to ongoing costs associated with the development of new products and technologies projected headcount growth and the operating impact of the spinnaker acquisition   general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses increased 481 to 546 million in fiscal 2004 from 368 million in fiscal 2003 these expenses represented 47 and 41 of total revenues for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and implement our enterprisewide erp system back office infrastructure and expanded regulatory requirements partially offset by cost control and reduction in discretionary spending efforts general and administrative headcount increased to 331 in fiscal 2004 from 283 in fiscal 2003 we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2005 due to expanded regulatory requirements amortization of spinnaker covenants not to compete included in general and administrative expenses was 11 million for fiscal 2004 and none in 2003 respectively estimated future amortization of covenants not to compete relating to the spinnaker acquisition will be 51 million and 15 million for fiscal year 2005 and 2006 respectively and none thereafter   stock compensation  — we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principle board opinion “apb” no 25 “apb no 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosures” deferred compensation recognized under apb no 25 is amortized to expense ratably over their vesting periods we account for stock options issued to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 and eitf no 9618 “accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services” under the fair value based method 40   stock compensation expenses were 39 million and 36 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively this net increase in stock compensation expenses reflected primarily higher stock compensation relating to the spinnaker acquisition and restricted stock awards offset by forfeitures of unvested options assumed in the spinnaker and webmanage acquisitions estimated future deferred stock compensation amortization expenses are 78 million 68 million 51 million and 37 million in fiscal 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively and none thereafter   restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in our workforce and consolidations of our facilities   fiscal 2002 second quarter restructuring plan in august 2001 we implemented the first restructuring plan which included a reduction in workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of facilities the action was required to properly align and manage the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels all functional areas of the company were affected by the reduction we completed our actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 80 million the restructuring charge included 48 million of severancerelated amounts 27 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs the reserve balance of 08 million at april 30 2004 was included in other accrued liabilities   during fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million during fiscal 2002 and 2003 we recorded net restructuring adjustments of 01 million and 03 million respectively due to changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final resolution of certain restructuring activities in the event that the foreign facilities that we vacated are not subleased we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately 04 million as of april 30 2004 to be payable through january 2006   as of april 30 2004 we have 07 million outstanding in our accrued and unpaid severancerelated restructuring costs due to changes in estimated costs of certain severancerelated matters we expect to pay or adjust the remaining severancerelated restructuring costs pending the outcome of the ultimate resolution of these matters in the next twelve months   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2004 in thousands    fiscal 2002 fourth quarter restructuring plan in april 2002 we completed a restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters as a result of this restructuring we recorded a charge of 59 million the restructuring charge included 08 million of severancerelated amounts 46 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs of the reserve balance at april 30 2004 07 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 45 million was classified as longterm obligations   in fiscal 2003 and 2004 we updated our assumptions and estimates based on certain triggering events which resulted in additional net charges of 09 million and 13 million respectively primarily relating to 41 sublease assumptions for our engineering facility our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in previous management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in the event that the engineering facility is not subleased as anticipated we will be obligated for an additional total lease payments of 18 million as of april 30 2004 to be payable through november 2010 

  the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2004 in thousands    interest income — during fiscal 2004 interest income was 137 million as compared to 122 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher cash and investment balances provided by operating activities partially offset by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio we expect interest income to increase for fiscal 2005 as a result of higher cash and invested balances in a higher interestrate portfolio environment as we reinvest our securities in longerterm investments   other expenses net — other expenses net included a net exchange loss from foreign currency transactions of 29 million and 10 million respectively for fiscal 2004 and 2003 the increase in net exchange loss was attributed to the impact of currency balance sheet hedging activities resulting from forecast variances   net gain loss on investments — our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary in fiscal 2004 we realized a net gain of 07 million on the sale of previously impaired investments in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash write down of 20 million related to the impairment of our investments partially offset by a gain of 08 million on previously impaired investments   gain on sale of intangible assets — we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets of 06 million in fiscal 2003 related to the sale of our contentreporter software we intend to resell this software through a licensing arrangement   provision benefit for income taxes — provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 included a nonrecurring income tax benefit of 168 million or approximately 005 per share associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 this favorable ruling from the netherlands provides for retroactive benefits dating back to fiscal year 2001 as well as current and future tax rate benefits this dutch tax ruling however will expire at the end of calendar 2005 there are uncertainties associated with securing a new dutch tax ruling as such we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend this ruling or secure any new favorable rulings the absence of which may have an adverse impact on our international operations   for fiscal 2004 we had an effective tax rate of 108 which included 99 reduction to account for the 168 million nonrecurring benefit from the foreign tax ruling the effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive and current benefits of the foreign tax ruling the 42 availability of tax credits and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2003 our effective tax rate was 218 which included certain benefits from tax credits and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction 

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002   product revenues  — product revenues increased by 99 to 8023 million in fiscal 2003 from 7299 million in fiscal 2002 product revenue growth occurred across all geographies this increase in product revenues was specifically attributable to increased software licenses and software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped as compared to the prior year   our revenue growth was primarily driven by new product innovation as we continue to enhance and extend our fullline enterprise portfolio providing customers with a lower overall cost of ownership we expanded both our customer base and strategic partnerships with enterprise infrastructure providers and gained market acceptance for our new and expanded unified storage nearstore and netcache products we believe our competitive advantage is a result of lower total cost of ownership from a combination of four factors lower acquisition cost reduced administrative overhead minimized service cost and reduced downtime of critical business applications   product revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors    product revenues were negatively impacted by the following factors    service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 312 to 898 million in fiscal 2003 from 685 million in fiscal 2002 service revenues are generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service period 43 obligations which are typically one to three years the increase in service revenues representing 101 and 86 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively was due to an increasing number of enterprise customers which typically purchase more complete service packages higher service revenues was also related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers 

  international total revenues  — international total revenues including us exports increased by 119 for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 international total revenues were 3752 million or 421 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 the increase in international sales for fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of european and asia pacific net revenues growth driven by larger storage implementations and new products and positive foreign exchange effects from a weak us dollar as compared to the prior year   product gross margin  — product gross margin increased to 651 of product revenues for fiscal 2003 as compared to 633 in fiscal 2002 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenue was 55 and 57 million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002   product gross margin was favorably impacted by    product gross margin was negatively impacted by    service gross margin  — service gross margin increased to 265 for fiscal 2003 compared to 182 for fiscal 2002 investments in global service increased by 178 to 660 million in fiscal 2003 from 560 million in fiscal 2002 the improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global service organizations combined with the ramping up of our service infrastructure in fiscal 2002 in anticipation of service revenue growth   sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain global service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 70 to 3042 million for fiscal 2003 from 2844 million for fiscal 2002 these expenses were 342 and 356 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 respectively the increase was attributed to the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete solutions at the enterprise level marketing and various advertising programs and expenses associated with our growing mix of enterprise customers and associated global account programs sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1199 in fiscal 2003 from 1224 in fiscal 2002   research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and development expenses decreased 33 to 1129 million in fiscal 2003 from 1167 million in fiscal 2002 these expenses represented 127 and 146 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of cost controls reduction in discretionary spending efforts and the impact of fiscal 2002 restructuring activities research and development headcount increased to 526 in fiscal 2003 from 514 in fiscal 2002 we expect to continuously support 44 current and future product development and enhancement efforts and incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies for both fiscal 2003 and 2002 no software development costs were capitalized 

  general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses decreased 84 to 368 million in fiscal 2003 from 402 million in fiscal 2002 these expenses represented 41 and 51 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively decreases in absolute dollars were primarily due to cost control reduction in discretionary spending efforts the successful collection of previously accrued customerspecific bad debt allowances partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and implement an enterprisewide erp system general and administrative headcount increased to 283 in fiscal 2003 from 246 in fiscal 2002   stock compensation  — we account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and comply with the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 36 million and 72 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively this decrease was primarily due to 22 million of lower deferred stock compensation amortization in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 attributed to forfeitures of unvested options assumed in the webmanage acquisition a decrease of 21 million of stock compensation as 165310 contingently issuable milestone shares relating to orca systems inc “orca” valued at 30 million were released in fiscal 2002 as compared to the release of 99186 shares valued at 09 million in fiscal 2003 offset by an increase of 07 million relating to the fair value of options granted to a member of the board of directors   restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities   fiscal 2002 second quarter restructuring plan in august 2001 we implemented the first restructuring plan which included a reduction in workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of facilities the action was required to properly align and manage the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels all functional areas of the company were affected by the reduction we completed our actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 80 million the restructuring charge included 48 million of severancerelated amounts 27 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs the reserve balance of 08 million at april 30 2003 was included in other accrued liabilities   during fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million during fiscal 2003 we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of 03 million due to changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final resolution of certain restructuring activities in the event that the foreign facilities are not subleased we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately 07 million as of april 30 2003 to be payable through january 2006 45   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 30 2003 and april 30 2002 in thousands    fiscal 2002 fourth quarter restructuring plan in april 2002 we announced and substantially completed a restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters which included a headcount reduction of 34 employees as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 59 million the restructuring charge included 08 million of severancerelated amounts 46 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoff of the reserve balance at april 30 2003 15 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 31 million was classified as longterm obligations   in january 2003 we updated our assumptions and estimates based on certain triggering events which resulted in an additional net charge of 09 million primarily relating to our engineering facility lease our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in the event that the engineering facility is not subleased we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of 34 million as of april 30 2003 to be payable through november 2010   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 30 2003 and 2002 in thousands    of the reserve balance at april 30 2003 15 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 31 million was classified as longterm obligations 46   interest income  — during fiscal 2003 interest income was 122 million as compared to 185 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher investment balances provided by operating activities   other expenses net  — other expenses net included a net exchange loss from foreign currency transactions of 10 million and 18 million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002   net loss on investments  — our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 20 million related to the impairment of our investment in our publicly traded and private companies partially offset by a gain of 08 million on previously impaired investments in fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies during fiscal 2003 we sold shares of certain privately held investments and realized a net loss of 05 million during fiscal 2002 we sold shares of certain marketable investments and the realized gain was not material   gain on sale of intangible assets  — we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets of 06 million in fiscal 2003 related to the sale of our contentreporter software we intend to resell this software through a licensing arrangement   provision benefit for income taxes  — for fiscal 2003 our effective tax rate was 218 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to credits and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction for fiscal 2002 we applied an annual benefit rate of 197 to pretax loss our effective tax rate is based on existing tax laws and distributions of incomeloss among different entities and tax jurisdictions liquidity and capital resources   as of april 30 2004 as compared to the april 30 2003 balances our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 1891 million to 8080 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital working capital increased by 1565 million to 7450 million as of april 30 2004 compared to 5885 million as of april 30 2003   in addition to higher net income in fiscal 2004 the primary factors that impacted the periodtoperiod change in cash flows relating to operating activities included the following that improved cash flow for the year  the above factors were partially offset by the effects of    we used 486 million and 613 million of cash in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively for capital expenditures we used net proceeds of 2351 million and 900 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively for net purchasesredemptions of shortterm investments in june 2003 we acquired additional 47 patents for a purchase price of approximately 90 million investing activities in

   as of april 30 2004 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled 1610 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid   we offer both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing arrangements to our customers under the terms of recourse leases which are generally three years or less we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the thirdparty leasing company in the event that any customers were to default we defer 100 of the recourse lease obligation and recognize revenue over the term of the lease as the lease payments become due as of april 30 2004 and 2003 the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled approximately 68 million and 49 million respectively under the terms of the nonrecourse leases we do not have any continuing obligations or liabilities to date we have not experienced significant losses under this lease financing program 49 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies market interest and interest income risk   interest and investment income  — as of april 30 2004 we had shortterm investments of 5668 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale and investment in marketable equity securities in primarily technology companies these highly liquid investments consisting primarily of government municipal and corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2004 would cause the fair value of these shortterm investments to decline by approximately 11 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio market price risk   equity securities  — we are also exposed to market price risk on our equity securities included in our shortterm investments which are primarily in publicly traded companies in the volatile technology industry sector in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 07 million related to the impairment of our investment in a publicly traded company   we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure from these securities and as a result the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from our investment in future periods may vary materially from the current fair value a 50 adverse change in the equity price would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our equity security as of april 30 2004   the hypothetical changes and assumptions discussed above may be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore such computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result the effect on actual earnings in the future may differ from those described above foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 for cash flow hedges the gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income at april 30 2004   we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with credit worthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 50   the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options contracts outstanding on april 30 2004 in thousands    the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2003 in thousands  51

sales and marketing   network appliance markets and distributes products globally in over 90 countries employing a multichannel distribution strategy which focuses on product sales to end users through a direct sales force valueadded resellers system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oem in north america we employ all forms of distribution previously mentioned with a focus on direct sales to our strategic and named accounts in europe we employ a mix of resellers and direct sales channels to sell to end users in asia our products are primarily sold through resellers which are supported by channel sales representatives and technical support personnel no single customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales in fiscal 2003 2002 or 2001 backlog   network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues manufacturing   manufacturing operations with insourced and outsourced locations in sunnyvale california and glasgow scotland include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control and final test we rely on many suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint qualitytraining programs we also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy see “risk factors — we rely on a limited number of suppliers” and “risk factors — the loss of our contract manufacturers” this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investment and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded the iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be isocertified research and development   during fiscal year 2003 network appliance launched unified storage platforms designed to support both san and nas simultaneously we introduced a number of new systems including the f825 midrange filer the fas940 and fas960 highend filers the netcache c1200 and c2100 and the nearstore r150 which continues to define a new category of storage solution we completed the development of the new fas250 entrylevel enterprise filer and began delivery to customers in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 we also launched new software products that significantly improve data management capabilities provide new solutions in the areas of data protection and backup and recovery and enable new business continuance functionality   see “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected” competition   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 13   in the storage market our fas appliances and data management software compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including dell lsi logic corp mti corp procom technology and silicon graphics inc   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including akamai technologies inc bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future   we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support   see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results” and “if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance” proprietary rights   we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance name and logo faserver® filerview netapp netcache secureshare® snapmanager snapmirror snaprestore and wafl as trademarks in the united states “us” other us trademarks and some of the other us registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued see “risk factors — if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating results” employees   as of april 25 2003 we had 2345 employees of the total 1199 were in sales and marketing 526 in research and development 283 in finance

risk factors   the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations please see page 3 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include but are not limited to the following    in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer 16 demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 

  due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 

 

   we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our filers and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer products as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages may be negatively affected   our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including  

 

   our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner 

 

   in fiscal 2002 we reduced fixed costs through workforce reductions and a consolidation of facilities we believe strict cost containment is essential to maintaining positive cash flow from operations and remaining profitable in future quarters especially since the outlook for future quarters is uncertain additional measures to reduce expenses may be undertaken if revenues and market conditions do not improve a number of factors could preclude us from successfully bringing costs and expenses in line with our revenues such as our inability to accurately forecast business activities and deterioration of our revenues if we are not able to effectively control our costs and achieve an expense structure commensurate with our business activities and revenues our cash flow and net income will be adversely affected 17 

 

   all of our products address the storage and content delivery markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend in addition our business also depends on general economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for network storage and content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending have resulted in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage and content delivery market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the network storage and content delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

   the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include    in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many hightechnology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the hightechnology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

   our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and internet caching devices and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however we cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact the sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in 18 response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  in particular in conjunction with the introduction of our product offerings in the fabricattached storage market we introduced products with new features and functionality that address the storage area network market during fiscal 2003 we introduced iscsienabled unified storage solutions we also introduced direct access file system dafs protocolcapable products and nearstore backup and recovery products during fiscal 2002 we face risks relating to these product introductions including risks relating to forecasting of demand for such products as well as possible product and software defects and a potentially different sales and support environment associated with selling these new systems if any of the foregoing occur our operating results could be adversely affected   as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands 

 

   our operations including our suppliers’ and contract manufacturers’ operations are susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss power shortages telecommunications failures breakins and similar events in addition our headquarters are located in northern california an area susceptible to earthquakes if any significant disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business could be impaired   weak economic conditions or terrorist actions could lead to significant business interruptions if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or direct impacts on our marketing manufacturing financial functions or our suppliers’ logistics function our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

   our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education backgrounds and industry experience in spite of the economic downturn competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley can be intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we conduct business internationally for fiscal 2003 approximately 421 of our total revenues were from international customers including us exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts   our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward contracts to hedge our currency exposure associated with certain assets 19 and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flow all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income there can be no assurance that such hedging strategy will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results   although operating results have not been materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality   we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 

 

   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology   in the storage market our fas appliances and data management software compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including dell lsi logic corp mti corp procom technology and silicon graphics inc   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including akamai technologies inc bluecoat systems formerly cacheflow inc and cisco systems inc   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future   we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors we cannot assure you that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater financial marketing service support technical and other resources   increased competition could result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized in the assembly of our products we purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier we purchase computer boards and 20 microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including 

   component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and for semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers   in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that is incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers in a timely manner 

 

   we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products our reliance on our thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationship with our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results   we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the inability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

 

   an element of our strategy to enhance revenue is to strategically partner with major thirdparty software and hardware vendors who integrate our products into their products and also comarket our products a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage 21 market there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners and even if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

  we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions to the extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively in addition the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on the progress of new products under development with that partner 

 

   from time to time we make equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives we have already made strategic investments in a number of network storagerelated technology companies equity investments may result in the loss of investment capital the market price and valuation of our equity investments in these companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over which we have little or no control and recent events have adversely affected the public equity market to the extent that the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended period of time our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 07 million related to the impairment of our investment in a publicly traded company in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments in publicly traded and private companies   as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we have acquired two companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001 we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities   acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value in addition we may experience a diversion of management’s attention the loss of key employees of acquired operations or the inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation   in addition we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairmentonly approach as of may 1 2002 the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying amount and no impairment was recognized on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise as of april 30 2003 there had been no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings see note 13 under notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

   our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors accordingly there is risk that these resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results 22 

 

   our products may contain undetected software hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to establish policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies essential to preparing our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual future results may differ materially from these estimates we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions in addition see our critical accounting policies under item 7 

 

   our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some us trademarks and some usregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers strategic partners and customers we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business   litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours   we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or 23 licensing agreements any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 










 item 2 properties tableend   our headquarters site for corporate general administration sales and marketing research and development customer services and manufacturing operations occupies approximately 675000 square feet of buildings in sunnyvale california in fiscal 2002 we terminated our operating lease obligations for our sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing the land and buildings for 2498 million   we lease other sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the us and internationally we believe that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed   as a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal 2002 we have exited office space under noncancellable leases in both the us and europe if we are unable to successfully sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space our operating results may be adversely affected see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k   see additional discussion regarding properties in “note 4 under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 


 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 


 item 4 submissions of matters to a vote of security holders tableend   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on form 10k 

part ii 


 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters tableend   our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on november 21 1995 and is traded under the symbol “ntap” as of april 25 2003 there were 1016 holders of record of the common stock the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market    we believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly see “item 1 business — risk factors”   we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate retaining all available funds if any to finance internal growth and product development as well as other management initiatives including stock repurchases and acquisitions payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our 24 earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” 

 

   we maintain a code of business conduct and ethics for directors officers and employees and will promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers our code of business practices addresses conflicts of interest confidentiality compliance with laws rules and regulations including insider trading laws and related matters critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates and judgments including those related to sales returns bad debts excess inventory and purchase commitments investments intangible assets lease losses and restructuring accruals income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates   we believe the accounting policies described below among others are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations  25  

 

   we apply the provisions of sop 972 “software revenue recognition” and related interpretations to all revenue transactions we recognize revenue when    for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately   a typical arrangement includes product software subscription and maintenance some arrangements include training and consulting software subscriptions include unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases and are included in product revenues service maintenance includes contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized ratably over the contractual term generally one to three years revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed   we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment these estimates are based on historical sales returns changes in customer demand and other factors if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required 

 

   we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 26 

 

   we write down inventory and record purchase commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable we may realize higher gross margin in the period when the writtendown inventory is sold   we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required 

 

   in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities these restructuring accruals were accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

   we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 

 

   we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 07 million related to impairments of our investments in a publicly traded company in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies accounting for stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principle board opinion no 25 “apb” no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for 27 stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosures deferred compensation recognized under apb no 25 is amortized to expense using the graded vesting method we account for stock options issued to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 and eitf no 9618 under the fair value based method 

 

   the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the us earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the us and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international business in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international business or in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate also our current effective tax rate assumes that us income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the us   the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets which is made up primarily of income tax deductions credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from stock option exercises assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions and credits if we do not generate sufficient future income the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock option exercises new accounting standards   in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs sfas no 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance principally eitf issue no 943 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 146 for restructuring activities initiated after december 31 2002 sfas no 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf issue no 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company’s commitment to an exit plan sfas no 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value accordingly sfas no 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote for those guarantees and indemnifications that do not fall within initial recognition and measurement requirements of fin 45 the company must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications as required under existing generally accepted accounting principles to identify if a loss has been incurred if the company determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred any such estimable loss would be recognized the initial recognition and measurement requirements do not apply to the company’s product warranties or to the provisions contained in the majority of the company’s software license agreements that indemnify licensees of the company’s software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that the company’s software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party the company has provided disclosures for the year ended april 30 2003 as required by fin 45 in note 14 to its consolidated financial statements the company does not expect adoption of the liability recognition provisions to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 28   in december 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenuegenerating activities in some arrangements the different revenuegenerating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is there are separate units of accounting in other arrangements some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately this issue addresses when and if so how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the company does not expect that the adoption of eitf 0021 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement 123” sfas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting of stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas 148 effective april 30 2003   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties the company does not expect to identify any variable interest entities that must be consolidated   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of sfas no 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 in particular this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative it also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and is not expected to have an impact on the company upon adoption   in may 2003 the fasb has issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” the statement improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that under previous guidance issuers could account for as equity the new statement requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position this statement is effective for interim periods beginning after june 15 2003 the company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement on its consolidated financial statement the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas 150 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements nonaudit services provided by independent auditors   during fiscal 2003 our independent auditors deloitte  touche llp performed the following nonaudit services that have been approved by our audit committee of the board of directors local statutory audits and certain taxation matters see more detailed disclosure in the proxy statement 29 results of operations   the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002   product revenues — product revenues increased by 99 to 8023 million in fiscal 2003 from 7299 million in fiscal 2002 product revenues growth was across all geographies this increase in product revenues was specifically attributable to increased software licenses and software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped as compared to the prior year   our revenue growth was primarily driven by new product innovation as we continue to enhance and extend our fullline enterprise portfolio providing customers with a lower overall cost of ownership we expanded both our customer base and strategic partnerships with enterprise infrastructure providers and gained market acceptance for our new and expanded unified storage nearstore and netcache products we believe our competitive advantage is a result of lower total cost of ownership from a combination of four factors lower acquisition cost reduced administrative overhead minimized service cost and reduced downtime of critical business applications 30   product revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors    product revenues were negatively impacted by the following factors    service revenues  — service revenues which include hardware support professional services and educational services increased by 312 to 898 million in fiscal 2003 from 685 million in fiscal 2002 service revenues are generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service period obligations which are typically one to three years the increase in service revenues representing 101 and 86 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively was due to an increasing number of enterprise customers who typically purchase more complete service packages higher service revenues was also related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers while it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a more comprehensive global enterprise support and service solution we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal 2004   international total revenues including us exports increased by 119 for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 international total revenues were 3752 million or 421 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 the increase in international sales for fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of european and asia pacific net revenues growth driven by larger storage implementations and new products and positive foreign exchange effects from a weak us dollar as compared to the prior year   product gross margin  — product gross margin increased to 651 of product revenues for fiscal 2003 as compared to 633 in fiscal 2002 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenue was 55 and 57 million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002 for fiscal 2004 estimated future amortization expense is 30 million and none thereafter   product gross margin was favorably impacted by  31    product gross margin was negatively impacted by    service gross margin  — service gross margin increased to 265 for fiscal 2003 compared to 182 for fiscal 2002 investments in customer service increased by 178 to 660 million in fiscal 2003 from 560 million in fiscal 2002 the improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer service organizations combined with the ramping up of our service infrastructure in fiscal 2002 in anticipation of service revenue growth   sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 70 to 3042 million for fiscal 2003 from 2844 million for fiscal 2002 these expenses were 342 and 356 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 respectively the increase was attributed to the continued worldwide investment in our sales and customer service organizations associated with selling complete solutions at the enterprise level marketing and various advertising programs and expenses associated with our growing mix of enterprise customers and associated global account programs sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1199 in fiscal 2003 from 1224 in fiscal 2002   we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce new products establish and expand new distribution channels and increase product and company awareness we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth   research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and development expenses decreased 33 to 1129 million in fiscal 2003 from 1167 million in fiscal 2002 these expenses represented 127 and 146 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of cost control reduction in discretionary spending efforts the impact of fiscal 2002 restructuring activities research and development headcount increased to 526 in fiscal 2003 from 514 in fiscal 2002 we expect to continuously support current and future product development and enhancement efforts and incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies   we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we intend to continuously expand our existing product offerings and introduce new products and expect that expenditures for these purposes will increase in absolute dollars for both fiscal 2003 and 2002 no software development costs were capitalized   general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses decreased 84 to 368 million in fiscal 2003 from 402 million in fiscal 2002 these expenses represented 41 and 51 of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively decreases in absolute dollars were primarily due to cost control reduction in discretionary spending efforts the successful collection of previously accrued customerspecific bad debt allowances partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and implement an enterprisewide erp system general and administrative headcount increased to 283 in fiscal 2003 from 246 in fiscal 2002 we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2004 due to the investment in our enterprisewide erp system and expanded regulatory requirements 32   amortization of goodwill  — due to the adoption of sfas no 142 goodwill is no longer amortized in fiscal 2003 as compared to amortization expense of 152 million in fiscal 2002   stock compensation  — we account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and comply with the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 36 million and 72 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively this decrease was primarily due to 22 million of lower deferred stock compensation amortization in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 attributed to forfeitures of unvested options assumed in the webmanage acquisition a decrease of 21 million of stock compensation as 165310 contingently issuable milestone shares relating to orca valued at 30 million were released in fiscal 2002 as compared to the release of 99186 shares valued at 09 million in fiscal 2003 offset by an increase of 07 million relating to the fair value of options granted to a member of the board of directors estimated future deferred stock compensation amortization relating to assumed webmanage unvested options and deferred salary investment options for fiscal 2004 are expected to be 12 million for fiscal 2005 estimated future stock compensation amortization expenses are 02 million and none thereafter   restructuring charges  — in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities 

 

   in august 2001 we implemented the first restructuring plan which included a reduction in workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of facilities the action was required to properly align and manage the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels all functional areas of the company were affected by the reduction we completed our actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 80 million the restructuring charge included 48 million of severancerelated amounts 27 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs the reserve balances of 08 million and 05 million respectively at april 30 2003 and 2002 were included in other accrued liabilities   during fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million during fiscal 2003 we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of 03 million due to changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final resolution of certain restructuring activities in the event that the foreign facilities are not subleased we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately 07 million to be payable through january 2006 33   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 30 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

 

   in april 2002 we announced and substantially completed a restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters which included a headcount reduction of 34 employees as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 59 million the restructuring charge included 08 million of severancerelated amounts 46 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoff of the reserve balance at april 30 2003 15 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 31 million was classified as longterm obligations   in january 2003 we updated our assumptions and estimates based on certain triggering events which resulted in an additional net charge of 09 million primarily relating to our engineering facility lease our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates such estimates included various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates in the event that the engineering facility is not subleased we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of 34 million to be payable through november 2010   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at april 30 2003 and 2002 in thousands    of the reserve balances at april 30 2003 and 2002 15 million and 11 million respectively were included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 31 million and 37 million respectively were classified as longterm obligations 34   interest income  — during fiscal 2003 interest income was 122 million as compared to 185 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher investment balances provided by operating activities we expect interest income to decline further in fiscal 2004 as existing investments mature and proceeds are reinvested in a lower interestrate environment   other income expense net  — other income expense net included a net exchange loss from foreign currency transactions of 10 million and 18 million respectively for fiscal 2003 and 2002   net loss on investments  — our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 07 million related to the impairment of our investment in a publicly traded company in fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies during fiscal 2003 we sold shares of certain privately held investments and realized a net loss of 05 million during fiscal 2002 we sold shares of certain marketable investments and the realized gain was not material   gain on sale of intangible assets  — we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets of 06 million in fiscal 2003 related to the sale of our contentreporter tm software we intend to resell this software through a licensing arrangement   provision benefit for income taxes  — for fiscal 2003 our effective tax rate was 218 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to credits and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction for fiscal 2002 we applied an annual benefit rate of 197 to pretax loss our effective tax rate is based on existing tax laws and distributions of incomeloss among different entities and tax jurisdictions fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001   product revenues  — product revenues decreased by 238 to 7299 million in fiscal 2002 from 9578 million in fiscal 2001 the decline in product revenues was due to a decrease in product sales to internetbased companies and reduced capital spending among technology companies across all geographies but primarily in north america this decrease in product revenues for fiscal 2002 was specifically attributable to a lower volume of units and software licenses shipped as compared to fiscal 2001   product revenues were negatively impacted by the following factors    product revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors  35    service revenues  — service revenues increased by 416 to 685 million in fiscal 2002 from 484 million in fiscal 2001 service revenue is generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service period obligations which are typically one to three years the increase in service revenues representing 86 and 48 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively was primarily related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers   international total revenues including us exports decreased by 124 for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 international total revenues were 3352 million or 420 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 the decline in international sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily a result of a slower demand in the europe and asia pacific markets offset by our increased sales and marketing efforts internationally   product gross margin  — product gross margin decreased to 633 of product revenues for fiscal 2002 as compared to 640 in fiscal 2001 amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenue was 57 and 26 million respectively for fiscal 2002 and 2001   product gross margin was negatively impacted by    product gross margin was favorably impacted by    service gross margin  — service gross margin increased to 182 for fiscal 2002 as compared to a negative gross margin of 238 in fiscal 2001 investments in customer service decreased by 65 to 560 million in fiscal 2002 from 599 million in fiscal 2001 the improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer service organizations the negative 36 service gross margin in fiscal 2001 was due to the ramping up and continued investment in our service infrastructure in anticipation of service revenue growth 

  sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses decreased 16 to 2844 million for fiscal 2002 from 2890 million for fiscal 2001 these expenses were 356 and 287 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively the decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to various cost control and reduction measures restructuring impact lower commission expenses and other profitdependent payrollrelated expenses and disposal of certain capital assets in fiscal 2001 partially offset by the continued worldwide investment in our sales and customer service organizations sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1224 in fiscal 2002 from 1277 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the restructuring impact   research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and development expenses decreased 35 to 1167 million in fiscal 2002 from 1209 million in fiscal 2001 these expenses represented 146 and 120 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of cost control reduction in discretionary spending efforts restructuring impact the two holiday facility shutdowns lower headcount and lower profitdependent payroll related expenses partially offset by the operating impact of the orca and webmanage acquisitions research and development headcount decreased to 514 in fiscal 2002 from 566 in fiscal 2001   general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses decreased 01 to 402 million in fiscal 2002 from 402 million in fiscal 2001 these expenses represented 50 and 40 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively decreases in absolute dollars were primarily due to cost controls reductions in discretionary spending the impact of restructuring the two holiday facility shutdowns and lower profitdependent payroll related expenses partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance enterprisewide management information systems general legal costs and an increase in the allowance for bad debts general and administrative headcount decreased to 246 in fiscal 2002 from 253 in fiscal 2001   amortization of goodwill  — due to the adoption of sfas no 142 goodwill is no longer amortized in fiscal 2003 as compared to amortization expense of 152 million in fiscal 2002 and 91 million in fiscal 2001   inprocess research and development  — we incurred inprocess research and development charges of approximately 267 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the acquisition of orca the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur   the orca acquisition has been successfully utilized for the design and development of the dafs protocol by eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead dafs allows for improved io performance while using fewer cpu cycles the protocol leverages next generation networking technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities including remote direct memory access “rdma” implemented in virtual interface “vi” and infiniband the dafs protocol has good industry support and is now under consideration as an industry standard we introduced dafs capable products in april 2002   stock compensation  — we account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and comply with the 37 provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 72 million and 62 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of stock compensation on options assumed in the webmanage acquisition and the release of 165310 contingently issuable milestone shares relating to orca valued at 30 million 

  restructuring charges  — in august 2001 we implemented a restructuring plan which included a reduction in workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of facilities the action was required to properly align and manage the business commensurate with our thencurrent revenue levels all functional areas of the company were affected by the reduction we completed our actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 80 million the restructuring charge included 48 million of severancerelated amounts 27 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million   as of april 30 2002 we had paid substantially all of the severance liability of the balance at april 30 2002 05 million was included in other accrued liabilities   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2002 in thousands    in april 2002 we announced and substantially completed a restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters which included a headcount reduction of 34 employees as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 59 million the restructuring charge included 08 million of severancerelated amounts 46 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs of the reserve balance at april 30 2002 11 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 36 million was classified as longterm obligations   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2002 in thousands    interest income and other net  — during fiscal 2002 interest income and other net was 166 million as compared to 234 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances from cash shortterm investments and 38 restricted cash generated from operations interest income and other net also included gains and losses from foreign currency transactions 

  net loss on investments  — we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies during fiscal 2002 and 2001 we sold shares of certain marketable equity securities and the realized gains for those periods were not material   provision benefit for income taxes  — for fiscal 2002 we applied an annual benefit rate of 197 to pretax loss for fiscal 2001 our effective tax rate was 345 which excluded the effect of nondeductible amortization of goodwill and the writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development our effective tax rate is based on existing tax laws and distributions of incomeloss among different entities and tax jurisdictions liquidity and capital resources   as of april 30 2003 as compared to the april 30 2002 balances our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 1647 million to 6188 million we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital working capital increased by 1249 million to 5885 million as of april 30 2003 compared to 4636 million as of april 30 2002 we generated cash from operating activities totaling 1953 million and 1439 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was principally related to net income of 765 million increases in other accrued liabilities accrued compensation and related benefits income taxes payable deferred revenue coupled with depreciation net loss on investments amortization of intangible assets and stock compensation partially offset by decreased accounts payable and increases in accounts receivable inventories deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses and other assets   we used 613 million and 2842 million of cash in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively for capital expenditures the fiscal 2002 property and equipment expenditure included the purchase of the land and buildings at our sunnyvale headquarters site for 2498 million excluding the sunnyvale headquarters land and buildings acquisition the increase in capital purchases year over year was primarily attributed to upgrades of our erp infrastructure computerrelated purchases and building improvements we used net proceeds of 900 million and 1499 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively for net purchases of shortterm investments investing activities in fiscal 2003 and 2002 also included new investments in privatelyheld companies of 07 million and 11 million respectively during fiscal 2003 we sold certain privately held investments and received proceeds of 08 million   we received 292 million and 2302 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively from financing activities the change in cash flow from financing in fiscal 2002 included the effects of a decrease in restricted cash requirements of 1937 million this requirement was eliminated in april 2002 in conjunction with the purchase of our sunnyvale headquarters and termination of our operating leases and thus had no effect on cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2003 the decrease in cash flow from financing activities was also a result of lower proceeds from stock option exercises as a result of the decline in our stock price   our capital and liquidity requirements depend on numerous factors including risks relating to fluctuating operating results continued growth in the network storage and content delivery markets customer and market acceptance of our products dependence on new products rapid technological change dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel risk inherent in our international operations competition reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers relationships with strategic partners dependence on 39 proprietary technology intellectual property rights the value of our investments in equity securities and real estate and other factors we believe that our existing liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 

 

   the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 30 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with managementapproved policies market interest and interest income risk   interest and investment income  — as of april 30 2003 we had shortterm investments of 3347 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale and investment in marketable equity securities in primarily technology companies these highly liquid investments consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2003 would cause the fair value of these shortterm investments to decline by approximately 07 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio market price risk   equity securities  — we are also exposed to market price risk on our equity securities included in our shortterm investments which are primarily in publicly traded companies in the volatile hightechnology industry sector in fiscal 2003 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 07 million related to the impairment of our investment in a publicly traded company in fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments in publicly traded and private companies   we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities and as a result the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from our investment in future periods may vary materially from the current fair value a 50 adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate 01 million decrease in the fair value of our equity security as of april 30 2003   the hypothetical changes and assumptions discussed above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore such computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by management 40 should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result the effect on actual earnings in the future will differ from those described above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas 133 for cash flow hedges the gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income and were not material at april 30 2003   we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes in entering into forward foreign exchange contracts we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with credit worthy multinational commercial banks all contracts have a maturity of less than one year   the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2003 in thousands    the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2002 in thousands  41

   network appliance also offers instructorled or webbased technical training as well as technical certification programs certified experienced network appliance trainers teach the instructorled programs around the world all courses include practical lessons and feature extensive handson experience in installing configuring and troubleshooting netapp systems sales and marketing   network appliance markets and distributes products globally in over 90 countries in north america we employ a multichannel distribution strategy which focuses on product sales to end users through a direct sales force as well as selected valueadded resellers in europe we employ a mix of resellers and direct sales channels to sell to end users in asia our products are primarily sold through resellers which are supported by channel sales representatives and technical support personnel no single customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales in fiscal 2002 2001 or 2000   during fiscal year 2002 we launched network appliance canada ltd and network appliance federal systems inc to increase our sales presence backlog   network appliance manufactures products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of revenues manufacturing   manufacturing operations primarily located in sunnyvale california include materials procurement commodity management component engineering test engineering manufacturing engineering product assembly product assurance quality control and final test we rely on many suppliers for materials as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers exchanging critical information and implementing joint qualitytraining programs during fiscal year 2002 we expanded the use of subcontractors for the production of major subassemblies primarily to reduce our lead times for shipments to europe and to improve our manufacturing redundancy see “risk factors — we rely on a limited number of suppliers” and “risk factors — the loss of our sole contract manufacturer” this manufacturing strategy minimizes capital 9 investment and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion we were awarded the iso 9001 certification on may 29 1997 and continue to be isocertified 

research and development   during fiscal year 2002 network appliance launched more products than in any other year in the history of the company we introduced a number of new systems including the f87 and f810 lowend systems the f880 and f880c highend systems and the nearstore r100 which defined a new category of storage solution we enhanced almost every software product in our portfolio and launched new products that significantly improve data management capabilities provide new solutions in the areas of backup and recovery and enable new business continuance functionality we introduced new products to better integrate our filers into microsoft exchange microsoft sql server and oracle database environments   see “risk factors — if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected” competition   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology   in the storage market our filer appliances and data management software compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including auspex systems inc dell lsi logic corp mti corp and procom technology   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including akamai technologies inc cacheflow inc cisco systems inc and inktomi corp   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and content delivery markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future   we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the storage and content delivery markets include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support   see “risk factors — an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results” and “if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance” proprietary rights   we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance name and logo faserver® filerview netapp netcache secureshare® snapmanager snapmirror snaprestore and wafl® trademarks in the united states other united states trademarks and some of the other united states registered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have multiple united states and international patent applications pending and multiple united states patents issued see — “risk factors — if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating results” employees   as of april 26 2002 we had 2280 employees of the total 1224 were in sales and marketing 514 in research and development 246 in finance and administration and 296 in manufacturing and customer service 10 operations our future performance depends in significant part on our key technical and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement we have never had a work stoppage and consider relations with our employees to be good 

executive officers   our executive officers and their ages as of may 25 2002 are as follows    daniel j warmenhoven joined the company in october 1994 as president and chief executive officer and has been a member of the board of directors since october 1994 in may 2000 he resigned the role of president and currently serves as chief executive officer and director of network appliance inc prior to joining the company mr warmenhoven served in various capacities including president chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of network equipment technologies inc a telecommunications company from november 1989 to january 1994 he presently serves on the board of directors of redback networks inc a communications products company mr warmenhoven holds a bs degree in electrical engineering from princeton university   thomas f mendoza was appointed president in may 2000 previously he served as our senior vice president worldwide sales and marketing from february 1999 and senior vice president worldwide sales from 1998 prior to that he served as vice president north american sales prior to april 1994 mr mendoza served in various capacities including vice president sales at work group technology vice president of north american sales at auspex systems inc and vice president of western operations at stratus computer corp mr mendoza holds a ba degree from the university of notre dame   jeffry r allen was appointed executive vice president finance and operations in may 2000 mr allen served as our chief financial officer senior vice president finance and operations and secretary from december 1996 to may 2001 from october 1994 to december 1996 mr allen served in various capacities including senior vice president of operations and vice president and controller of bay networks inc prior to october 1994 mr allen held various positions at synoptics inc the latest of which was vice president and controller before joining synoptics inc he held various positions at hewlettpackard company the latest of which was controller of the information networks group mr allen holds a bs degree from san diego state university   david hitz cofounder of network appliance was appointed executive vice president engineering in may 2000 and has served as our senior vice president engineering since february 2000 mr hitz has served as our vice president since april 1992 prior to 1992 mr hitz worked as a senior engineer at auspex systems inc and held various engineering positions at mips computer mr hitz holds a bs degree in computer science and electrical engineering from princeton university   james k lau cofounder of network appliance was appointed executive vice president and chief strategy officer in may 2000 mr lau has served as our vice president chief technical officer and vice president of engineering since april 1992 prior to that he served as director of software development at auspex systems inc prior to auspex he served as group manager of pc products at bridge communications now known as 3com mr lau holds a bs degree in computer science and mathematics from the university of california berkeley and a master’s degree in computer engineering from stanford university risk factors   the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional 11 risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include the following    in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order in certain circumstances customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty product sales are also difficult to forecast because the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 12   due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more future quarters our results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our products   we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our filers and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer products as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content overall gross margin percentages will be negatively affected conversely we believe our increased licensing of addon software products may favorably impact gross margins   our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors including  a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed which could affect our net income   our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels net income will be disproportionately affected cost and expense control may be critical to maintaining positive cash flow from operations and profitability   in fiscal 2002 we reduced fixed costs through workforce reductions and a consolidation of facilities we believe strict cost containment is essential to maintaining positive cash flow from operations and remaining profitable in future quarters especially since the outlook for future quarters is subject to numerous challenges additional measures to reduce expenses may be undertaken if revenues and market conditions do not improve a number of factors could preclude us from successfully bringing costs and expenses in line with our revenues such as our inability to accurately forecast business activities and deterioration of our revenues if we are not able to effectively control our costs and achieve an expense structure commensurate with our business activities and revenues our cash flow and net income will be adversely affected our future financial performance depends on growth in the network storage and content delivery markets and any lack of growth will have a material adverse effect on our operating results   all of our products address the storage and content delivery markets accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend in addition our business also depends on general economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for network 13 storage and content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending have resulted in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates the network storage and content delivery market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 causing both our revenues and operating results to decline if the network storage and content delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future   the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include    in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many hightechnology companies additionally certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates the market climate for the hightechnology sector and levels of corporate spending on information technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance or if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products our operating results could be materially adversely affected   our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage subsystems and internet caching devices and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject to significant technical risks however we cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods may also impact the sales of existing products in addition our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our operating results could be materially adversely affected   in particular in conjunction with the introduction of our product offerings in the blockdata storage market we have begun introducing products with new features and functionality that address the storage area network san market we also introduced direct access file system dafs protocolcapable products and nearstore backup and recovery products during fiscal 2002 we face risks relating to these product introductions including risks relating to forecasting of demand for such products as well as possible product and software defects and a potentially different sales and support environment associated with selling these new systems if any of the foregoing occur our operating results could be adversely affected 14   as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism   current global economic and political factors including terrorism could harm our business weak economic conditions terrorist actions and the effects of ongoing military actions against terrorists could lead to significant business interruptions if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or direct impacts on our marketing manufacturing financial functions or our suppliers’ logistics function our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel   our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education backgrounds and industry experience competition for qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley is intense the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially adversely affect our operating results risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results   we conduct business internationally for fiscal 2002 approximately 420 of our total revenues were from international customers including united states exports accordingly our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements government spending patterns and acts of terrorism and international conflicts   our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables all hedge contracts are marked to market through earnings every period there can be no assurance that such hedging strategy will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results   additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results   although operating results have not been materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality   we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 15 an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating results   the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology   in the storage market our filer appliances and data management software compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc corporation hitachi data systems hewlettpackard company including the integrated compaq computer corporation ibm corporation and sun microsystems inc we have also historically encountered lessfrequent competition from companies including auspex systems inc dell lsi logic corp mti corp and procom technology   in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery software vendors including cisco systems inc cacheflow inc inktomi corp and akamai technologies inc   additionally a number of new privately held companies are currently attempting to enter our markets some of which may become significant competitors in the future   we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer service and support although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors we cannot assure you that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater financial marketing service support technical and other resources   increased competition could result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products in addition current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially adversely affect our operating results we rely on a limited number of suppliers and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results   we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized in the assembly of our products we purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier we purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks including    component quality is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there are periodic supplyanddemand issues for disk drives microprocessors and for semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such 16 components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  in addition we license certain technology and software from third parties that is incorporated into our products if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers in a timely manner 

 

   we currently rely on a contract manufacturer to manufacture most of our products our reliance on a thirdparty contract manufacturer reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance production costs and product supply if we should fail to effectively manage our relationship with our contract manufacturer or if our contract manufacturer experiences delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production are expensive and timeconsuming if we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties which could adversely impact our operating results   we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturer and suppliers we may need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of highquality products or the ability to obtain raw materials could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

 

   from time to time we make equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives we have already made strategic investments in a number of network storagerelated technology companies equity investments may result in the loss of investment capital the market price and valuation of our equity investments in these companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over which we have little or no control and recent events have adversely affected the public equity market to the extent that the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended period of time our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies   as part of our strategy we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities we have acquired two companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001 we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities   acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value in addition we may experience a diversion of management’s attention the loss of key employees of acquired 17 operations or the inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

 

   our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies including products of our competitors accordingly there is risk that these resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

   our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford only limited protection some united states trademarks and some united statesregistered trademarks are registered internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers and customers we currently have multiple united states and international patent applications pending and multiple united states patents issued the pending applications may not be approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business   litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours   we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 18 










 item 2 properties   in fiscal 2002 we terminated our operating lease obligations for our sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing the land and buildings for 2498 million our headquarters site for corporate general administration sales and marketing research and development customer services and manufacturing operations occupies approximately 675000 square feet of buildings in sunnyvale california   we lease other sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the united states and internationally we believe that our existing facilities and those being developed in sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed   as a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal 2002 we are not currently utilizing certain existing space in our california headquarters site additionally we have also exited office space under noncancellable leases in other locations both in the united states and europe if we are unable to successfully sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space our operating results may be adversely affected see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k   see additional discussion regarding properties in “note 4 under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 




 item 3 legal proceedings   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 4 submissions of matters to a vote of security holders   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on form 10k 

part ii 




 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters   our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on november 21 1995 and is traded under the symbol “ntap” as of april 26 2002 there were 944 holders of record of the common stock the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market    we believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly see “item 1 business — risk factors”   we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate retaining all available funds if any to finance internal growth and product development payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time 19 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and the risk factors set forth in “item 1 business” critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates and judgments including those related to sales returns bad debts excess inventory and purchase commitments investments intangible assets lease losses and restructuring accruals income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates   we believe the accounting policies described below among others are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations  revenue recognition and allowances   we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 and related interpretations to all revenue transactions we recognize revenue when   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement   delivery has occurred our product is physically delivered to our customers generally with standard transfer terms as fob shipping point products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement delivery is not considered to have occurred   the fee is fixed or determinable arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable   collection is probable probability of collection is assessed on a customerbycustomer basis customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately their ability to pay if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process revenue is recognized upon cash receipt   for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 21   a typical arrangement includes product software subscription and maintenance some arrangements include training and consulting software subscriptions include unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis bug fixes and patch releases and are included in product revenues service maintenance includes contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term generally one to three years revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed   we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment these estimates are based on historical sales returns changes in customer demand and other factors if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience additional allowances may be required   we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer solvency current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required inventory writedown   we writedown inventory and record purchase commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional writedowns and other charges against earnings may be required   we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we also provide for the estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality issues when they arise should actual cost of product failure differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated liability would be required restructuring accruals and impairment losses on investments   in fiscal 2002 as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates we implemented two restructuring plans which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities   we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facility requirements and identified excess facility space which has subsequently been offered for sublease based upon the results of this analysis during fiscal 2002 we recorded charges related to estimated facilities lease losses net of expected sublease income in determining the net facilities charge various assumptions were made including the time period over which the facilities will be vacant expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates the charges recorded were estimates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 “accounting for contingencies” and represented the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of future triggering events triggering events may include but are not limited to changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities sublease terms sublease rates and lease termination should operating lease rental rates decline or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility adjustments to the facilities lease losses liabilities may be necessary in future periods based upon the thencurrent actual events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million   in fiscal 2002 we also recorded charges for a reduction in workforce in response to a decline in customer demand and macroeconomic conditions see footnote 12 — restructuring charges for further discussion 22 these estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 

  our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities during fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies see footnote 2 — shortterm investments and investments in nonpublic companies for further discussion valuation of intangible assets and goodwill   we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets include goodwill purchased technology and workforce factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded if an impairment charge is recognized the amortization related to goodwill and other intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year no impairment losses were recorded during fiscal 2002 based on these measurements accounting for income taxes   the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states sales to our international customers are generally taxed at rates that are lower than us rates resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international sales in addition a decrease in the percentage of our total revenue from international customers or in the mix of international revenue among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate also our current effective tax rate assumes that us income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the us   the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets which is made up primarily of income tax deductions credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from stock option exercises assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions and credits if we do not generate sufficient future income the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock option exercises 23 new accounting standards   on may 1 2001 we adopted sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flow   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 141 all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 must be accounted for using the purchase method under sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life the amortization provisions of sfas no 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july 1 2001 we are required to adopt sfas no 142 effective may 1 2002 upon adoption of sfas no 142 we will stop the amortization of goodwill including acquired existing workforce with a net carrying value of approximately 498 million at april 30 2002 and the annual amortization of 152 million that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption we will evaluate goodwill under the sfas no 142 transitional impairment test any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a change in accounting principle on the date of adoption we have not determined whether adoption of sfas no 142 will have an impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flow   in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for assets to be disposed of” adoption of sfas no 144 is required for our fiscal year beginning may 1 2002 we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of sfas no 144 on our financial position and results of operations and have not yet determined the impact of adopting this statement 24 results of operations   the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001   product revenues  — product revenues decreased by 238 to 7299 million in fiscal 2002 from 9578 million in fiscal 2001 the decline in product revenues was due to a decrease in product sales to internetbased companies and reduced capital spending among technology companies across all geographies but primarily in north america this decrease in product revenues for fiscal 2002 was specifically attributable to a lower volume of units and software licenses shipped as compared to fiscal 2001   product revenues were negatively impacted by the following factors    product revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors  25    service revenues  — service revenues increased by 416 to 685 million in fiscal 2002 from 484 million in fiscal 2001 service revenue is generally deferred and in most cases recognized ratably over the service period obligations which are typically one to three years the increase in service revenues representing 86  and 48 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively was primarily related to a growing installed base resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers   international total revenues including united states exports decreased by 124 for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 international total revenues were 3352 million or 420 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 the decline in international sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily a result of a slower demand in the europe and asia pacific markets offset by our increased sales and marketing efforts internationally   product gross margin  — product gross margin decreased to 641 of product revenues for fiscal 2002 as compared to 643 in fiscal 2001   product gross margin was negatively impacted by    product gross margin was favorably impacted by  26   service gross margin  — service gross margin increased to 182 for fiscal 2002 as compared to a negative gross margin of 238 in fiscal 2001 investments in customer service decreased by 65 to 560 million in fiscal 2002 from 599 million in fiscal 2001 the improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer service organizations the negative service gross margin in fiscal 2001 was due to the ramping up and continued investment in our service infrastructure in anticipation of service revenue growth   sales and marketing  — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses decreased 16 to 2844 million for fiscal 2002 from 2890 million for fiscal 2001 these expenses were 356 and 287 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively the decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to various cost control and reduction measures restructuring impact lower commission expenses and other profitdependent payrollrelated expenses and disposal of certain capital assets in fiscal 2001 partially offset by the continued worldwide investment in our sales and customer service organizations sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1224 in fiscal 2002 from 1277 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the restructuring impact we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce new products establish and expand new distribution channels and increase product and company awareness we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth   research and development  — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and development expenses decreased 35 to 1167 million in fiscal 2002 from 1209 million in fiscal 2001 these expenses represented 146 and 120 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of cost control reduction in discretionary spending efforts restructuring impact the two holiday facility shutdowns lower headcount and lower profitdependent payroll related expenses partially offset by the operating impact of the orca systems inc “orca” and webmanage technologies inc “webmanage” acquisitions research and development headcount decreased to 514 in fiscal 2002 from 566 in fiscal 2001 we expect to continuously support current and future product development and enhancement efforts and incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies   we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements we intend to continuously expand our existing product offerings and introduce new products and expect that expenditures for these purposes will increase in absolute dollars for both fiscal 2002 and 2001 no software development costs were capitalized   general and administrative  — general and administrative expenses decreased 01 to 402 million in fiscal 2002 from 402 million in fiscal 2001 these expenses represented 50 and 40 of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively decreases in absolute dollars were primarily due to cost controls reductions in discretionary spending the impact of restructuring the two holiday facility shutdowns and lower profitdependent payroll related expenses partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance enterprisewide management information systems general legal costs and an increase in the allowance for bad debts general and administrative headcount decreased to 246 in fiscal 2002 from 253 in fiscal 2001 we believe that our general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly in absolute dollars in fiscal 2003   amortization of intangible assets — amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization on acquired intangible assets and amortization on the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by us intangible assets as of april 30 2002 including goodwill existing workforce and technology were being amortized over estimated useful lives of three to five years we assess the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through estimated useful cash flows amortization of intangible assets charged to operations was 209 million and 117 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively 27   inprocess research and development — we incurred inprocess research and development charges of approximately 267 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the acquisition of orca the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur research and development costs to bring the products from orca to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition   the orca acquisition has been successfully utilized for the design and development of the dafs protocol by eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead dafs allows for improved i o performance while using fewer cpu cycles the protocol leverages next generation networking technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities including remote direct memory access “rdma” implemented in virtual interface “vi” and infiniband the dafs protocol has good industry support and is now under consideration as an industry standard we introduced dafs capable products in april 2002   stock compensation — we account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and comply with the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 72 million and 62 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of stock compensation on options assumed in the webmanage acquisition and the release of 165310 contingently issuable milestone shares relating to orca valued at 30 million we expect an additional stock compensation relating to 99187 contingently issuable orca common share to be measured on the date the performance criteria are met   restructuring charges — in august 2001 we implemented a restructuring plan which included a reduction in workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of facilities the action was required to properly align and manage the business commensurate with our thencurrent revenue levels all functional areas of the company were affected by the reduction we completed our actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 80 million the restructuring charge included 48 million of severancerelated amounts 27 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we purchased our sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the operating leases as a result an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by 15 million   as of april 30 2002 we had paid substantially all of the severance liability of the balance at april 30 2002 05 million was included in other accrued liabilities 28   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2002 in thousands    in april 2002 we announced and substantially completed a restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the sunnyvale headquarters which included a headcount reduction of 34 employees as a result of this restructuring we incurred a charge of 59 million the restructuring charge included 08 million of severancerelated amounts 46 million of committed excess facilities and facility closure expenses and 05 million in fixed assets writeoffs of the reserve balance at april 30 2002 11 million was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining 36 million was classified as longterm obligations   the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at april 30 2002 in thousands    we expect annual cost savings of approximately 298 million as a result of the restructuring and reduction in force actions taken in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002   interest income and other net — during fiscal 2002 interest income and other net was 166 million as compared to 234 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances from cash shortterm investments and restricted cash generated from operations we expect interest income to decline further in fiscal 2003 as existing investments mature and proceeds are reinvested in a lower interestrate environment interest income and other net also included gains and losses from foreign currency transactions   impairment loss on investments — we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable such indicators include but are not limited to limited capital resources limited prospects of receiving additional financing and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a noncash otherthantemporary writedown of 130 million related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies during fiscal 2002 and 2001 we sold shares of certain marketable equity securities and the realized gains for those periods were not material   provision benefit for income taxes — for fiscal 2002 we applied an annual benefit rate of 197 to pretax loss for fiscal 2001 our effective tax rate was 345 which excluded the effect of nondeductible amortization of goodwill and the writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development our estimate is based on existing tax laws and our current projections of incomeloss and distributions of incomeloss among different entities and tax jurisdictions and is subject to change based primarily on varying levels of profitability 29 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000   business combinations — during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we acquired orca for a purchase price of 500 million in common stock assumed options and cash with an obligation to provide 264497 shares of common stock which will result in additional stock compensation charges if certain performance criteria are achieved we also paid certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition amounts allocated to existing workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a straightline basis over threeand fiveyear periods respectively approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses   during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 we acquired webmanage for 594 million in common stock assumed options and cash with an obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at 30 million if certain performance criteria are achieved the performance criteria were met in march 2001 and the contingent consideration has been recorded as stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001 we also paid certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition amounts allocated to existing technology and workforce are being amortized on a straightline basis over three years and amounts allocated to goodwill are being amortized over five years   product revenues — product revenues increased by 719 to 9578 million in fiscal 2001 from 5574 million in fiscal 2000 product revenues growth was across all geographies products and markets this increase in product revenues for fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to a higher volume of units shipped as compared to fiscal 2000 this growth in volume declined in the second half of fiscal 2001 factors impacting unit growth include    product revenues growth was also positively impacted by  30    overall product revenues growth was partially offset by    service revenues — service revenues increased by 1203 to 484 million in fiscal 2001 from 219 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in service revenues representing 48  and 38 of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively was primarily related to a growing installed base needing maintenance and technical support   international total revenues including united states exports grew by 1150 for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 international total revenues were 3825 million or 380 of total revenues for fiscal 2001 the increase in international revenues for fiscal 2001 was primarily a result of european and asia pacific total revenues growth due to increased headcount in the direct sales force increased indirect channel sales increased shipments of filers cluster failover solutions and netcache appliances and increased sales of addon software licenses as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year   product gross margin — product gross margin increased to 643 of product revenues for fiscal 2001 from 628 for fiscal 2000   product gross margin was favorably impacted by    gross margin was negatively impacted by    service gross margin — service gross margin was negative 238 for fiscal 2001 as compared to negative gross margin of 293 in fiscal 2000 investments in customer service increased by 1111 to 599 million in fiscal 2001 from 284 million in fiscal 2000 the negative service gross margin in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 was due to the ramping up and continued investment in our service infrastructure in anticipation of service revenues growth   sales and marketing — sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 878 to 2890 million for fiscal 2001 from 1539 million for fiscal 2000 these expenses were 287 and 266 of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in absolute dollars 31 was primarily related to the continued worldwide expansion of our sales and customer service organizations expansion of various marketing and industry initiatives increased commission expenses in the first three quarters and disposal of certain capital assets in the fourth quarter sales and marketing headcount increased to 1277 in fiscal 2001 from 775 in fiscal 2000 

  research and development — research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and development expenses increased 964 to 1209 million in fiscal 2001 from 616 million in fiscal 2000 these expenses represented 120 and 106 of total revenues for fiscal year 2001 and 2000 respectively research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of increased headcount operating impact of orca and webmanage acquisitions ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies including the netapp f85 f800 series filers and the new generation of our netcache appliances coupled with our content distribution and reporting software research and development headcount increased to 566 in fiscal 2001 from 327 in fiscal 2000 we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements for both fiscal 2001 and 2000 no software development costs were capitalized   general and administrative — general and administrative expenses increased 907 to 402 million in fiscal 2001 from 211 million in fiscal 2000 these expenses represented 40 and 36 of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased headcount expenses associated with initiatives to enhance enterprisewide management information systems and increased professional service fees general and administrative headcount increased to 253 in fiscal 2001 from 162 in fiscal 2000   amortization of intangible assets — amortization of intangible assets represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by us intangible assets as of april 30 2001 including goodwill existing workforce and technology are being amortized over the estimated useful life of three to fiveyear periods we assess the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through estimated useful cash flows amortization of intangible assets charged to operations was 117 million and 02 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively   inprocess research and development — we incurred inprocess research and development charges of approximately 267 million in fiscal 2001 related to the acquisition of orca the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur research and development costs to bring the products from orca to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition   we believe we can utilize the orca acquisition to develop the first virtual interfacebased vi next generation of network storage systems we are leveraging vi architecture to develop the dafs protocol dafs enables data transfers straight from the file server allowing clusters of application servers in heterogeneous environments to share data from the memory of one system to the memory of another without involving generalpurpose operating systems thereby improving cpu utilization and speeding up data access we expect to continue the development of products using this protocol and believe that there is a reasonable 32 chance of successfully delivering initial products in calendar year 2001 however there is risk associated with the completion of the inprocess project and there can be no assurance that such project will meet with either technological or commercial success failure to successfully develop and commercialize this inprocess project would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation additionally the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired the risks associated with the research and development are still considered high and no assurance can be made that upcoming products will meet market expectations or gain market acceptance 

  stock compensation — we account for stockbased employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” for employee compensation awards and comply with the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” for nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 62 million and 13 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in the webmanage acquisition issuance of contingently issuable milestone shares increased participation in the salaried stock option grant program by certain highly compensated employees and nonemployee stock options awards   total other income net — total other income net was 234 million and 90 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in interest income was primarily due to increased cash and shortterm investments generated from operations and net proceeds from stock option exercises   provision for income taxes — our effective tax was 345 excluding the effect of nondeductible amortization of goodwill and acquired inprocess research and development of 355 million for fiscal 2001 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 was 355 the effective tax rates differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to state taxes credits tax exempt interest goodwill amortization and acquired inprocess research and development liquidity and capital resources   we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital which increased by 468 million to 4636 million as of april 30 2002 as compared to the april 30 2001 balances our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 901 million to 4541 million we generated cash from operating activities totaling 1439 million and 2184 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 was principally related to net income of 30 million decreases in accounts receivable and increases in other accrued liabilities deferred revenue coupled with depreciation impairment loss on investments amortization of intangibles and stock compensation partially offset by decreases in accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and increases in inventories   in addition to lower net income in fiscal 2002 the primary factors that impacted the periodtoperiod change in cash flows relating to operating activities included the following  33   the above factors were partially offset by the effects of    we used 2842 million and 837 million of cash in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively for capital expenditures the fiscal 2002 increase in property and equipment includes the purchase of the land and buildings at our sunnyvale headquarters site for 2498 million since we have curtailed capital expenditures purchases of fixed assets were only 344 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 837 million the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily attributed to the slowdown in hiring and various cost control and cutting measures we have used 1499 million and 143 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively for net purchases of shortterm investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we acquired orca for a purchase price of approximately 500 million including common stock contingently issuable common stock assumed options cash payments of 20 million and related transaction costs in the third quarter of 2001 we acquired webmanage for a purchase price of approximately 594 million including common stock assumed options cash payments of 50 million and related transaction costs investing activities in fiscal 2002 and 2001 also included new equity investments of 11 million and 70 million respectively   we received 2302 million in fiscal 2002 and used 1132 million in fiscal 2001 from financing activities the increase in fiscal 2002 was primarily from the decrease in restricted cash see “ commitments and contingencies” note 4 to notes to condensed consolidated financial statements partially offset by decreased proceeds from the sale of common stock the decrease in cash provided by sales of common stock for fiscal 2002 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year was primarily due to lower stock option exercise proceeds as a result of the decline in our stock price   our capital and liquidity requirements depend on numerous factors including risks relating to fluctuating operating results continued growth in the network storage and content delivery markets customer and market acceptance of our products dependence on new products rapid technological change dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel risk inherent in our international operations competition reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers dependence on proprietary technology intellectual property rights the value of our investments in equity securities and real estate and other factors we believe that our existing liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months contractual obligations   the following summarizes our contractual obligations at april 30 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  34 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates market prices and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with boardapproved policies market interest and interest income risk   interest and investment income — as of april 30 2002 we had shortterm investments of 2434 million our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months which are classified as availableforsale and investment in marketable equity securities in certain technology companies these highly liquid investments consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at april 30 2002 would cause the fair value of these shortterm investments to decline by approximately 05 million because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio market price risk   equity securities — we are also exposed to market price risk on our equity security included in our shortterm investments such investment is in a publicly traded company in the volatile hightechnology industry sector we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on this security and as a result the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from this investment in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount a 50 adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate 03 million decrease in the fair value of our equity security as of april 30 2002   the hypothetical changes and assumptions discussed above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore such computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result the effect on actual earnings in the future will differ from those described above foreign currency exchange rate risk   we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities   all contracts have a maturity of less than one year and we do not defer any gains and losses as they are all accounted for through earnings every period   the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2002 in thousands  35   the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on april 30 2001 in thousands  36

and the overall enduser experience these products also allow administrators to
analyze web traffic and integrate with thirdparty billing applications

     during fiscal 2000 we shipped two new storage management software
solutions  snapmanager for microsoft exchange and appliancewatch software new
caching product introductions in fiscal 2000 included netcache software release
40 and netcache 41 software adding streaming media support for apple
quicktime microsoft windows media and realnetworks real systemtm g2tm
users delivering live broadcasting on the internet

     our future growth depends on the successful development and introduction of
new hardware and software however we cannot assure you that these or other
new products will attain market acceptance see  risk factor  if we are
unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological
change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance our operating
results could be materially adversely affected

     our total expenses for research and development for fiscal years 2001
2000 and 1999 were 1209 million 616 million and 300 million
respectively we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase
moderately in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002

competition

     the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are
characterized by rapidly changing technology

     in the storage market our filer appliances and data management software
compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc
corporation hitachi data systems compaq computer corporation sun
microsystems inc hewlettpackard company and ibm corporation we also
encounter less frequent competition from companies including mti corp procom
technology lsi logic corp and auspex systems inc

     in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content
delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery
software vendors including cisco systems inc cacheflow inc inktomi corp
akamai technologies inc and volera

     this past year has seen an increasing number of new privately held
companies attempting to enter our markets some of which may become significant
competitors in the future

     we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include but are not limited to

      response time and performance

      scalability

      data availability

      multiprotocol data sharing

      acquisition price and low overall total cost of ownership

      easeofuse and deployment

      customer service and support

     network appliance believes that we have significant demonstrable advantages
over our competitors although we believe that our products currently compete
favorably with respect to these factors we can not assure you that we can
maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors
especially those with significantly greater financial marketing service
support technical and other resources

     see risk factors  an increase in competition could materially adversely
affect our operating results and  if we are unable to develop and introduce
new products and respond to technological change or if our new products do not
achieve market acceptance

     we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include product benefits such as response time reliability data availability
scalability easeofuse price multiprotocol capabilities and customer
service and support although we believe that our products currently compete
favorably with respect to these factors we can not assure you that we can
maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors
especially those with significantly greater financial marketing service
support technical and other resources

proprietary rights

     we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade
secrets confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to
protect our proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation
and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws
which afford only limited protection we have registered our network appliance
name and logo faserverr filerview netapp netcache and
securesharer trademarks in the united states other united states trademarks
and some of the other united states registered trademarks are registered
internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of
additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees resellers and customers we currently have
multiple united states and international patent applications pending and
multiple united states patents issued see  risk factors  if we are unable
to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition
that could materially adversely affect our operating results

employees

     as of april 27 2001 we had 2403 employees of the total 1277 were in
sales and marketing 566 in research and development 253 in finance and
administration and 307 in operations our future performance depends in
significant part on our key technical and senior management personnel none of
whom is bound by an employment agreement we have never had a work stoppage and
consider relations with our employees to be good

risk factors

     the following risk factors and other information included in this annual
report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less
significant may also impair our business operations if any of the following
risks actually occur our business operating results and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected

                                        8

factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate

     although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods
prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2001 this growth may not be indicative of
our future operating results as a result we believe that periodtoperiod
comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance many of the
factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate
significantly in the future are beyond our control and include the following

      general economic trends

      global trends related to information technology spending

      demand for storage and content delivery products

      the level of competition in our target product markets

      the size timing and cancellation of significant orders

      product configuration and mix

      market acceptance of new products and product enhancements

      new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors

      deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product
       enhancements

      changes in pricing by us or our competitors

      our ability to develop introduce and market new products and
       enhancements in a timely manner

      supply constraints

      technological changes in our target product markets

      the levels of expenditure on research and development and expansion of
       our sales and marketing programs and

      seasonality

     in addition sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be
inconsistent with our plans we generally operate with limited order backlog
because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received as
a result product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked
and shipped in that quarter product sales are also difficult to forecast
because the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle
varies substantially from customer to customer

     due to all of the foregoing factors it is possible that in one or more
future quarters our results may fall below the expectations of public market
analysts and investors as has been the case through the last two quarters of
fiscal 2001 in such event the trading price of our common stock would likely
decrease

our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our products

     we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives
as components of our filers and the resale market for hard disk drives is
highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures our sales of disk
drives generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer products
as a result as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive
content overall gross margin percentages will be negatively affected
conversely we believe our increased licensing of addon software products may
favorably impact gross margins

     our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of
other factors including

      demand for storage and content delivery products

      discount levels and price competition

                                        9
page   11

      direct versus indirect sales

      the mix of software as a percentage of revenue

      the mix and average selling prices of products

      new product introductions and enhancements and

      the cost of components manufacturing labor and quality

a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed which could affect our net
income

     our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales
and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed as a result if sales
levels are below expectations as has been the case through the second half of
fiscal 2001 net income will be disproportionately affected

our future financial performance depends on growth in the network storage and
content delivery market and any lack of growth will have a material adverse
effect on our operating results

     all of our products address the storage and content delivery market
accordingly our future financial performance will depend in large part on
continued growth in the storage and content delivery market and on emerging
standards in these markets we cannot assure you that the market for storage and
content delivery will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these
markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix windows nt and the world
wide web server markets in addition our business also depends on general
economic and business conditions a reduction in demand for network storage and
content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases in
corporate spending has resulted in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth
rates the network storage and content delivery market growth declined
significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 causing both our
revenues and operating results to decline if the network storage and content
delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if network storage and
content delivery based on emerging standards other than those adopted by us
become increasingly accepted by the market our operating results could be
materially adversely affected

the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past
and will likely continue to do so in the future

     the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past and
several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future
these factors include

      fluctuations in our operating results

      fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be
       comparable to us

      a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts
       expectations

      changes in analysts recommendations or projections

      announcements of new products applications or product enhancements by us
       or our competitors and

      changes in our relationships with our suppliers customers and strategic
       partners

     in addition the stock market has experienced volatility that has
particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high
technology companies additionally certain macro economic factors such as
changes in interest rates as well as market climate for the high technology
sector could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock as a result
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future
and any broad market decline as well as our own operating results may
materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock

                                        10
page   12

the success of our netcache appliance products depends upon market acceptance of
caching technology and continued growth in the content delivery market

     in late 1997 we released our netcache appliance products a new category
of hardwarebased internet caching appliances designed to speed and manage the
delivery of information stored on the web however hardwarebased caching
technology is still developing

     our future financial performance will depend in part on the acceptance of
caching technology and the acceptance of our netcache appliance products we
cannot assure you that the caching appliance market will continue to grow at
previous rates or at all

if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
technological change or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance
our operating results could be materially adversely affected

     our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction
of new hardware and software products due to the complexity of storage
subsystems and internet caching devices and the difficulty in gauging the
engineering effort required to produce new products such products are subject
to significant technical risks during fiscal 2001 we began shipping the f85
and f800 series the netcache c6100 the netcache c3100 the netcache c1100 and
contentdirector and contentreporter content management software products the
netcache platform with netcache 50 software offers live and videoondemand
capability however we cannot assure you that any of our new products will
achieve market acceptance additional product introductions in future periods
may also impact the sales of existing products in addition our new products
must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are
unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce new
products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or
customer requirements or if such products do not achieve market acceptance our
operating results could be materially adversely affected

we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel

     our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify
attract motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel because
our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and
introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to
identify attract motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite
education backgrounds and industry experience competition for qualified
engineers particularly in silicon valley is intense the loss of the services
of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to
our development efforts or business relationships and could materially adversely
affect our operating results

risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results

     we conduct business internationally for the year ended april 27 2001
approximately 380 of our net sales were to international customers including
united states exports accordingly our future operating results could be
materially adversely affected by a variety of factors some of which are beyond
our control including regulatory political or economic conditions in a
specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory
requirements and government spending patterns

     our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign
currencies an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign
currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially
less competitive in foreign markets for international sales and expenditures
denominated in foreign currencies we are subject to risks associated with
currency fluctuations we hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates on earnings we utilize forward contracts to hedge trade and
intercompany receivables and payables all hedge contracts are marked to market
through earnings every period there can be no assurance that such hedging
strategy will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will
not have a material adverse effect on our operating results

                                        11
page   13

     additional risks inherent in our international business activities
generally include among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles
difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax
consequences such factors could materially adversely affect our future
international sales and consequently our operating results

     although operating results have not been materially adversely affected by
seasonality in the past because of the significant seasonal effects experienced
within the industry particularly in europe our future operating results could
be materially adversely affected by seasonality

     we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase
international market demand for our products we believe our net sales will not
increase in fiscal 2002 at the rate at which they grew in fiscal 2001

an increase in competition could materially adversely affect our operating
results

     the storage and content delivery markets are intensely competitive and are
characterized by rapidly changing technology

     in the storage market our filer appliances and data management software
compete primarily against storage products and data management software from emc
corporation hitachi data systems compaq computer corporation sun
microsystems inc hewlettpackard company and ibm corporation we also
encounter less frequent competition from companies including mti corp procom
technology lsi logic corp and auspex systems inc

     in the content delivery market our netcache appliances and content
delivery software compete against caching appliance and content delivery
software vendors including cisco systems inc cacheflow inc inktomi corp
akamai technologies inc and volera

     this past year has seen an increasing number of new privately held
companies attempting to enter our markets some of which may become significant
competitors in the future

     we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include but are not limited to

      response time and performance

      scalability

      data availability

      multiprotocol data sharing

      acquisition price and low overall total cost of ownership

      easeofuse and deployment

      customer service and support

     although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with
respect to these factors we can not assure you that we can maintain our
competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those
with significantly greater financial marketing service support technical
and other resources

     increased competition could result in price reductions reduced gross
margins and loss of market share any of which could materially adversely affect
our operating results our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than
we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or
devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of
their products in addition current and potential competitors have established
or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third
parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among
competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share we cannot
assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or
future competitors competitive pressures we face could materially adversely
affect our operating results

     we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include product features such as response time reliability data availability
scalability ease of use price multiprotocol capabilities and customer
service and support although we believe that our products currently compete
favorably with respect
                                        12
page   14

to these factors we cannot assure you that we can maintain our competitive
position against current and potential competitors especially those with
significantly greater financial marketing service support technical and
other resources

we rely on a limited number of suppliers and any disruption or termination of
these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could
materially adversely affect our operating results

     we rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key components utilized
in the assembly of our products we purchase most of our disk drives through a
single supplier we purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited
number of suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves
several risks including

      a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components
       because we do not have longterm supply commitments

      supplier capacity constraints

      price increases

      timely delivery and

      component quality

     in the future we intend to increasingly rely on contract manufacturers to
assemble our products if our contract manufacturers operations were
interrupted for any reason our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to
customers would be materially adversely affected

     component quality is particularly significant with respect to our supplier
of disk drives in order to meet product performance requirements we must
obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity in addition there
are periodic supply and demand issues for disk drives microprocessors and for
semiconductor memory components which could result in component shortages
selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components we cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such
components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase in
addition problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and
timeliness of deliveries could occur disruption or termination of the supply of
these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially
adversely affect our operating results such delays could also damage
relationships with current and prospective customers

we cannot assure you that we will not incur problems with current or future
equity investments and acquisitions or that we will realize value from such
strategic relationships

     we are continuously evaluating alliances and external investment in
technologies related to our business we have already made relatively small
strategic investments in a number of network storage related technology
companies and acquired two companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001 equity
investments may result in the loss of investment capital acquisitions of
companies or products and alliances and strategic investments entail numerous
risks and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate
acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies economies
of scale or other value in addition we may experience a diversion of
managements attention the loss of key employees of acquired operations or the
inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities any
such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition and results of operation

we cannot assure you that our oem relationships with dell computer corporation
and fujitsu limited will generate significant revenue

     while our agreements with dell computer corporation and fujitsu limited are
an element of our strategy to increase penetration in the windows nt market
neither dell computer corporation nor fujitsu limited have made purchase
commitments for our products currently we do not and cannot assure you that we
will generate significant revenue from these agreements
                                        13
page   15

we do not have exclusive relationships with our distributors and accordingly
there is a risk that those distributors may give higher priority to products of
other suppliers which could materially adversely affect our operating results

     our distribution customers generally offer products of several different
companies including products of our competitors accordingly there is risk
that these distributors may give higher priority to products of other suppliers
which could materially adversely affect our operating results

undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss
of or delay in market acceptance of our products which could materially
adversely affect our operating results

     our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released despite testing by us and by current
and potential customers errors may not be found in new products until after
commencement of commercial shipments resulting in loss of or delay in market
acceptance which could materially adversely affect our operating results

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to
increased competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
results

     our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology we
currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws trade secrets
confidentiality procedures contractual provisions and patents to protect our
proprietary rights we seek to protect our software documentation and other
written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws which afford
only limited protection we have registered trademarks including our network
appliance name and logo faserver filerview netapp netcache and
secureshare trademarks in the united states other united states trademarks
and some of the other united states  registered trademarks are registered
internationally as well we will continue to evaluate the registration of
additional trademarks as appropriate we generally enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees and with our resellers and customers we currently
have multiple united states and international patent applications pending and
multiple united states patents issued the pending applications may not be
approved and if patents are issued such patents may be challenged if such
challenges are brought the patents may be invalidated we cannot assure you
that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable
that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will
not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not
materially adversely affect our ability to do business

     litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology any such
litigation may be timeconsuming and costly despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary in
addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights
to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you
that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our
competitors will not independently develop similar technology duplicate our
products or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property
rights of ours

     we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims we may from
time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual
property rights in fiscal 1997 we settled litigation related to the alleged
infringement of third party rights and other claims which resulted in a pretax
expense of 43 million 35 million in payments to the plaintiffs and 08
million in legal fees third parties may in the future claim infringement by us
with respect to current or future products patents trademarks or other
proprietary rights we expect that companies in the appliance market will
increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and
competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in
different industry segments overlaps any such claims could be timeconsuming
result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays require us to
redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing
agreements any of which could materially adversely affect our operating
results such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available
on terms acceptable to us or at all

                                        14

protective antitakeover provisions in our charter and bylaws could materially
adversely affect stockholders

     our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and
restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote
or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock will be
subject to and may be materially adversely affected by the rights of the
holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of
preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third
party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock further certain
provisions of our bylaws pertaining to the future elimination of cumulative
voting and shareholder action by written consent could delay or make more
difficult a proxy contest involving us which could materially adversely affect
the market price of our common stock

we rely on a continuous power supply and any power shortage could interrupt our
manufacturing operations and could materially adversely affect our operating
results

     california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our
operations and increase our expenses in the event of an acute power shortage
that is when power reserves for the state of california fall below certain
critical levels california has on some occasions implemented and may in the
future continue to implement rolling blackouts we currently have limited
backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout and
our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our
customerssuppliers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power
supply if blackouts interrupt our power supply or our suppliers power supply
we could be temporarily unable to continue operations at our california
facilities any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our
facilities or our suppliers facilities to manufacture products could damage our
reputation harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new
customers and could result in lost revenue any of which could materially
adversely affect our operating results









item 2 properties

     in fiscal 2000 we executed agreements to acquire approximately 377 acres
of land in sunnyvale california these sites will support expansion of
approximately 800000 square feet to accommodate future growth in fiscal 1999
we executed agreements to acquire approximately 18 acres of land in sunnyvale
california and to develop 393000 square feet of buildings this headquarter
site consolidated general administration sales and marketing research and
development customer services and manufacturing operations

     we have commitments related to operating lease arrangements under which we
have an option to purchase various properties for an aggregate of 3090
million or arrange for the sale of the properties to a third party for at least
the option price with a contingent liability for any deficiency we lease other
sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the united
states and internationally we believe that our existing facilities and those
being developed in sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at least the
next two years and that additional space will be available as needed

     we believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our
common stock to fluctuate significantly see item 1 business  risk factors

     we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently
anticipate retaining all available funds if any to finance internal growth and
product development payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our
earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may
consider or deem appropriate at the time



item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     the following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related
notes thereto set forth under item 8 financial statements and supplementary
data this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those
anticipated in those forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors
including those set forth in item 1 business  risk factors and elsewhere in
this annual report on form 10k

overview

     we pioneered the concept of the network appliance for storage  an
extension of the industry trend toward dedicated specialized products that
perform a single function today we are a leader in delivering highperformance
network storage and content delivery solutions on a network our storage and
content delivery platforms filers and netcache appliances are coupled with
content distribution and reporting software this centertoedge solution offers
seamless data management from the backend data center to the edge of the
network quickly simply and reliably

     we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sales of our
network filer and caching appliances as a result a reduction in the demand for
our filer and netcache appliances due to increased competition a general
decline in the market for network storage and content delivery or other factors
could materially adversely affect our operating results

     our gross margin has been and may continue to be affected by a variety of
other factors including

      demand for storage and content delivery products

      discount levels and price competition

      product configuration

      direct versus indirect sales

      the mix of software as a percentage of revenue

      the mix and average selling prices of products

      new product introductions and enhancements and

      the cost of components manufacturing labor and quality

     operating results have not been materially adversely affected by
seasonality in the past however because of the significant summer seasonal
effects experienced within the industry particularly in europe our future
operating results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality

     for the year ended april 30 2001 approximately 380 of our net sales were
derived from international customers including united states exports
accordingly our future operating results could be materially adversely affected
by a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control for more
information on risks associated with our international operations see item
1  business  risk factors  risks inherent in our international operations
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000

     business combinations  during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we
acquired orca systems inc for a purchase price of 500 million in common
stock assumed options and cash with an obligation to provide 264497 shares of
common stock which will result in additional stock compensation charges if
certain performance criteria are achieved we also paid certain transaction
costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities the acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase the purchase price of the transaction was allocated
to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as
of the date of the acquisition amounts allocated to existing workforce and
goodwill are being amortized on a straightline basis over threeand fiveyear
periods respectively approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess
research and development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
uses

     during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 we acquired webmanage
technologies inc for 594 million in common stock assumed options and cash
with an obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at 30
million if certain performance criteria are achieved the performance criteria
were met in march 2001 and the contingent consideration has been recorded as
stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001 we also paid certain
transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities the
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase the purchase price of the
transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition amounts allocated to
existing technology and workforce are being amortized on a straightline basis
over three years and amounts allocated to goodwill are being amortized over five
years

     net sales  net sales increased by 737 to 10062 million in fiscal
2001 from 5793 million in fiscal 2000 net sales growth was across all
geographies products and markets this increase in net sales was primarily
attributable to a higher volume of units shipped as compared to the
corresponding period of the

                                        18
page   20

prior fiscal year this growth in volume declined in the second half of fiscal
2001 factors impacting unit growth include

      demand for our f700 filers utilizing primarily fibrechannel disks

      introduction of our new higher capacity f840 midrange f820 and f85
       entrylevel filer products

      increased worldwide demand for our netcache appliances and content
       delivery network solutions

      increased worldwide shipment of netapp cluster failover solutions which
       require another filer to take over in the event of a hardware failure

      increased demand for the snapmirror software option which requires
       multiple filers to provide remote mirroring of data for quick disaster
       recovery and backup at remote sites

      expansion of our sales organization to 976 in fiscal 2001 from 582 in
       fiscal 2000 and

      increased sales through indirect channels including sales through our
       oem partners representing 239 and 280 of total net sales for fiscal
       2001 and 2000 respectively

     net sales growth was also positively impacted by

      a higher average selling price of our addon software options
       snapmirror snaprestore and snapmanager for microsoft exchange and
       cluster failover supporting missioncritical applications

      a higher average selling price of our new highend f840 filer

      a higher average selling price due to the introduction of netcache
       software features including contentreporter and contentdirector

      the increase in storage capacity

      increased addon software revenue from multiprotocol solutions and

      higher software subscription and service revenues to support a growing
       installed base

     overall net sales growth was partially offset by

      declining demand for our products in the second half of fiscal 2001

      declining average selling price of the f700 filers and caching products
       due to competitive pricing and

      declining unit sales of our older product family

     international net sales including united states exports grew by 1150
for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 international net sales were 3825
million or 380 of total net sales for fiscal 2001 the increase in
international sales for fiscal 2001 was primarily a result of european and asia
pacific net sales growth due to increased headcount in the direct sales force
increased indirect channel sales increased shipments of filers cluster
failover solutions and netcache appliances and increased sales of addon
software licenses as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal
year we expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an effort to
expand domestic and international markets introduce new products establish and
expand new distribution channels and increase product and company awareness we
believe our international net sales will not increase in fiscal 2002 at the rate
at which they grew in fiscal 2001

     gross margin  gross margin increased to 601 of net sales for fiscal
2001 from 593 for fiscal 2000

     gross margin was favorably impacted by

      increased licensing of addon software options such as multiprotocol
       cluster failover snapmirror snaprestore snapmanager and new software
       introductions including contentreporter and contentdirector

      growth in software subscriptions due primarily to a larger installed
       base

      lower costs of key components
                                        19
page   21

      the increase in product volume

      increased manufacturing efficiencies and

      a mix shift to highend f840 systems sold as diskless upgrades carrying
       higher margin than configured systems

     gross margin was negatively impacted by sales price reductions on storage
products due to competitive pricing pressure higher disk content with an
expanded storage capacity for the f840 filer lower sales volume in the second
half of fiscal 2001 lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory and
increased investments in customer service

     our gross margin has been and may continue to be affected by a variety of
factors including

      demand for our products

      discount levels and price competition

      product configuration

      direct versus indirect sales

      the mix of software as a percentage of revenue

      the mix and average selling prices of products

      new product introductions and enhancements and

      the cost of components manufacturing labor and quality

     sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer
service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 878 to
2890 million for fiscal 2001 from 1539 million for fiscal 2000 these
expenses were 287 and 266 of net sales for fiscal 2001 and 2000
respectively the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the
continued worldwide expansion of our sales and customer service organizations
expansion of various marketing and industry initiatives increased commission
expenses in the first three quarters and disposal of certain capital assets in
the fourth quarter sales and marketing headcount increased to 1277 in fiscal
2001 from 775 in fiscal 2000 we expect to continue to selectively add sales
capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce
new products establish and expand new distribution channels and increase
product and company awareness we do not expect to increase our sales and
marketing expenses materially in fiscal 2002

     research and development  research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring
engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and
development expenses increased 964 to 1209 million in fiscal 2001 from 616
million in fiscal 2000 these expenses represented 120 and 106 of net sales
for fiscal year 2001 and 2000 respectively research and development expenses
increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of increased headcount
operating impact of orca and webmanage acquisitions ongoing support of current
and future product development and enhancement efforts prototyping expenses and
nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development of new
products and technologies including the netapp f85 f800 series filers and the
new generation of our netcache appliances coupled with our content distribution
and reporting software research and development headcount increased to 566 in
fiscal 2001 from 327 in fiscal 2000 we believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product
line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain
technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer
requirements we intend to continuously expand our existing product offerings
and introduce new products and expect that such expenditures will continue to
increase moderately in absolute dollars for both fiscal 2001 and 2000 no
software development costs were capitalized

     general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased
907 to 402 million in fiscal 2001 from 215 million in fiscal 2000 these
expenses represented 40 and 36 of net sales for fiscal

                                        20
page   22

2001 and 2000 respectively increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to
increased headcount expenses associated with initiatives to enhance
enterprisewide management information systems and increased professional
service fees general and administrative headcount increased to 253 in fiscal
2001 from 162 in fiscal 2000 we believe that our general and administrative
expenses will not increase significantly in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002

     amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets
represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by us intangible assets as
of april 30 2001 including goodwill existing workforce and technology are
being amortized over the estimated useful life of three to fiveyear periods we
assess the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the
amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through estimated useful
cash flows amortization of intangible assets charged to operations was 117
million and 02 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively

     inprocess research and development  we incurred inprocess research and
development charges of approximately 267 million in fiscal 2001 related to the
acquisition of orca the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the
acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the
date of the acquisition approximately 267 million was allocated to inprocess
research and development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
uses the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into
account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired
inprocess technology these estimates are subject to change given the
uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur excluding the charge that may
result from 264497 contingently issuable common shares research and
development costs to bring the products from orca to technological feasibility
are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations
or financial condition

     we believe we can utilize the orca acquisition to develop the first virtual
interfacebased vi next generation of network storage systems we are
leveraging vi architecture to develop the direct access file system dafs
protocol dafs enables data transfers straight from the file server allowing
clusters of application servers in heterogeneous environments to share data from
the memory of one system to the memory of another without involving
generalpurpose operating systems thereby improving cpu utilization and
speeding up data access we expect to continue the development of products using
this protocol and believe that there is a reasonable chance of successfully
delivering initial products in calendar year 2001 however there is risk
associated with the completion of the inprocess project and there can be no
assurance that such project will meet with either technological or commercial
success failure to successfully develop and commercialize this inprocess
project would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the
fair value allocation additionally the value of other intangible assets
acquired may become impaired the risks associated with the research and
development are still considered high and no assurance can be made that upcoming
products will meet market expectations or gain market acceptance

     stock compensation  we account for stockbased employee compensation
arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb no 25 accounting for stock
issued to employees for employee compensation awards and comply with the
provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation for
nonemployee compensation awards accordingly we recognize the intrinsic value
for employees and the fair value for nonemployees as stock compensation expense
over the vesting terms of the awards stock compensation expenses were 62
million and 13 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively this increase
was primarily attributable to the recognition of stock compensation of unvested
options assumed in the webmanage acquisition issuance of contingently issuable
milestones shares increased participation in the salaried stock option grant
program by certain highly compensated employees and nonemployee stock options
awards

                                        21
page   23

     total other income net  total other income net was 234 million and
90 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in interest
income was primarily due to increased cash and shortterm investments generated
from operations and net proceeds from stock option exercises

     provision for income taxes  our effective tax was 345 excluding the
effect of nondeductible amortization of goodwill and acquired inprocess
research and development of 355 million for fiscal 2001 the effective tax
rate for fiscal 2000 was 355 the effective tax rates differed from the us
statutory rate primarily due to state taxes credits tax exempt interest
goodwill amortization and acquired inprocess research and development

fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

     net sales  net sales increased by 1002 to 5793 million in fiscal
2000 from 2894 million in fiscal 1999 net sales growth was across all
geographies products and markets this increase was primarily attributable to a
higher volume of units shipped as compared to the corresponding period of the
prior fiscal year factors impacting unit growth include

      strong demand for our f700 filer products utilizing primarily
       fibrechannel connectivity

      increased worldwide demand for our netcache solutions

      increased worldwide shipment of netapp cluster failover solutions which
       require another filer to take over in the event of a hardware failure

      increased demand for the snapmirror software option which requires
       multiple filers to provide remote mirroring of data for quick disaster
       recovery and backup at remote sites

      expansion of our sales organization to 582 in fiscal 2000 from 309 in
       fiscal 1999 and

      increased sales through indirect channels representing 280 of total
       sales compared to 252 in the prior year including sales through our
       two oem partners

     net sales growth was also positively impacted by

      a higher average selling price due to the introduction of new software
       features snapmirror snaprestore and cluster failover supporting
       missioncritical applications

      the increase in storage capacity

      increased addon software revenue from multiprotocol solutions and

      higher software subscription and service revenues to support a growing
       installed base

     overall net sales growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of
our older products and declining average selling price of the caching products
due primarily to competitive pricing pressure

     international net sales including united states exports grew by 1004
for fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 international net sales were 1779
million or 307 of total net sales for fiscal 2000 the increase in
international sales for fiscal 2000 was primarily a result of european sales
growth due to increased headcount in the direct sales force increased indirect
channel sales increased shipments of filers cluster failover solutions
netcache appliances and increased sales of addon software licenses asia
pacific net sales growth for fiscal 2000 was also primarily driven by increased
sales through resellers increased headcount in the direct sales force
increased shipments of filers and netcache appliances and increased sales of
addon software licenses as compared to fiscal 1999

     we cannot assure you that our net sales will continue to increase in
absolute dollars or at the rate at which they have grown in recent fiscal
periods

     gross margin  gross margin increased slightly to 593 of net sales for
fiscal 2000 from 592 for fiscal 1999

     gross margin was favorably impacted by

      increased licensing of addon software options such as multiprotocol
       cluster failover snapmirror and snaprestore associated with new filers
       shipped

      growth in software subscription due primarily to a larger installed base

      increased manufacturing efficiencies

      the increase in product volume and

      lower costs of key components

     gross margin was negatively impacted by sales price reductions on storage
products due to competitive pricing pressure from other storage vendors and
increased investments in customer service personnel in areas such as logistics
and professional services

     sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries commissions advertising and promotional expenses and certain customer
service and support costs sales and marketing expenses increased 1044 to
1539 million for fiscal 2000 from 753 million for fiscal 1999 these
expenses were 266 and 260 of net sales for fiscal 2000 and 1999
respectively the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the
continued worldwide expansion and increased headcount growth of our sales and
customer service organizations and increased commission expenses sales and
marketing headcount increased from 411 at april 30 1999 to 775 at april 30
2000 in fiscal 2000 we launched various marketing and advertising programs
which also contributed to absolute dollar increases in sales and marketing
expenses we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in
an effort to expand domestic and international markets introduce new products
establish and expand new distribution channels and increase product and company
awareness we believe that our continued growth and profitability is dependent
in part on the successful expansion of our international operations and
therefore have committed significant resources to increase international sales

     research and development  research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits prototype expenses nonrecurring
engineering charges and fees paid to outside consultants research and
development expenses increased 1055 to 616 million in fiscal 2000 from 300
million in fiscal 1999 these expenses represented 106 and 104 of net sales
for fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively research and development expenses
increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of increased headcount
ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement
efforts prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges associated
with the development of new products and technologies research and development
headcount increased from 198 at april 30 1999 to 327 at april 30 2000 in
fiscal 2000 we shipped new enterprise software offerings and data management
tools with snapmanager for microsoft exchange and appliancewatch we also
introduced new caching products which included netcache software release 40 and
netcache 41 adding streaming media support for apple quicktime microsoft
windows media and realnetworks real system g2 users delivering live
broadcasting on the internet in fiscal 1999 we introduced the f700 series
filers the cluster failover solutions the c700 caching products snapmirror
snaprestore and secureadmintm we believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product
line develop new products that achieve market acceptance maintain
technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer
requirements we intend to continuously expand our existing product offerings
and introduce new products and expect that such expenditures will continue to
increase in absolute dollars for both fiscal 2000 and 1999 no software
development costs were capitalized

     general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased
1141 to 211 million in fiscal 2000 from 99 million in fiscal 1999 these
expenses represented 36 and 34 of net sales for fiscal 2000 and 1999
respectively increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased
headcount expenses associated with initiatives to implement enterprisewide
management information systems increases in
                                        23
page   25

professional services consulting fees and outside service fees general and
administrative headcount increased from 80 at april 30 1999 to 162 at april 30
2000 we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in
absolute dollars as we continue to build our infrastructure

     total other income net  total other income net was 90 million and
19 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase was due
primarily to interest income earned on the net proceeds from the march 1999
followon public offering cash generated from operations and net proceeds from
stock option exercises fiscal 1999 included losses from foreign currency
transactions as compared to fiscal 2000 where gains or losses from foreign
transactions have been partially mitigated through our hedging program

     provision for income taxes  our effective tax rate was 355 for fiscal
2000 compared to 375 for the fiscal 1999 the effective tax rates differed
from the us statutory rate primarily due to state taxes credits and tax
exempt interest

liquidity and capital resources

     as of april 30 2001 as compared to the april 30 2000 balances our cash
cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 105 million to 3640
million working capital decreased by 31 million to 4167 million the
decrease was primarily a result of 1937 million restricted cash used to
collateralize our operating leases we generated cash from operating activities
totaling 2184 million and 1181 million in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
respectively net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2001 was
principally related to net income of 749 million increases in accounts
payable income taxes payable accrued compensation and related benefits and
deferred revenue decreases in prepaid expenses and other coupled with
depreciation inprocess research and development amortization of intangibles
stock compensation amortization partially offset by increases in accounts
receivable inventories deferred income taxes and decrease in other accrued
liabilities

     we used 837 million and 408 million of cash in fiscal 2001 and fiscal
2000 respectively for capital expenditures the increase was primarily
attributed to upgrades of software and computer equipment purchases and
furniture and fixtures for the sunnyvale headquarters facility we have used
143 million and 689 in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 respectively for net
purchases of shortterm investments in june 2000 we acquired orca for a
purchase price of approximately 500 million including common stock
contingently issuable common stock assumed options cash payments of 20
million and related transaction costs in november 2000 we acquired webmanage
for a purchase price of approximately 594 million including common stock
contingently issuable common stock assumed options cash payments of 50
million and related transaction costs investing activities in fiscal 2001 also
included new equity investments of 70 million

     we have used 1133 million in fiscal 2001 for financing activities and
received 538 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year
the increase in cash provided by sales of common stock in fiscal 2001 compared
to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year was due to an increased
quantity of stock options exercised at a higher average exercise price and a
greater number of employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan
offsetting this increase for the fiscal year 2001 was restricted cash of 1937
million used to collateralize operating leases see note 4 to the notes to the
condensed consolidated financial statements

     excluding the commitments related to operating lease arrangements for
various properties in our sunnyvale headquarters which aggregate 3090
million we currently have no significant commitments other than commitments
under operating leases we believe that our existing liquidity and capital
resources including the available amounts under our 50 million line of
credit are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve
months

new accounting standards

     sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000
sfas no 133 as amended establishes accounting and reporting

                                        24
page   26

standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instrument
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133
certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the
definition of a derivative we will adopt sfas effective may 1 2001 and do not
expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial
position results of operations or cash flow



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates
market prices and in foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative
financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are
used in accordance with boardapproved policies

market interest and interest income risk

     interest and investment income  as of april 27 2001 we had shortterm
investments of 921 million our investment portfolio consists of highly liquid
investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and
twelve months and investment in marketable equity securities in certain
technology companies these highly liquid investments consisting primarily of
government and corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate and
interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates
increase a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from
levels at april 27 2001 would cause the fair value of these shortterm
investments to decline by an immaterial amount because we have the ability to
hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any significant
decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes
declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

     operating lease commitments  as of april 27 2001 we have outstanding
lease commitments to a thirdparty entity under operating lease agreements
which vary based on a monthly london interbank offered rate libor rate plus a
spread a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would increase our
annual rent expense under operating lease commitments by approximately 15
million increases in interest rates could however increase our rent expenses
associated with future lease payments we do not currently hedge against
interest rate increases our investment portfolio offers a natural hedge against
interest rate risk from our operating lease commitments in the event of a
significant increase in the market interest rate moreover a total of 1937
million in operating leases are collateralized with investments that have
similar and thus offsetting interest rate characteristics

market price risk

     equity securities  we are also exposed to market price risk on our equity
securities included in our shortterm investments these investments are in high
technology companies in the volatile hightechnology industry sector we do not
attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities and as a
result the amount of income or loss and cash flow that we ultimately realize
from these investments in future periods may vary materially from the current
unrealized amount a 50 adverse change in the equity price would result in an
approximate 41 million decrease in the fair value of our equity securities as
of april 27 2001 no such equity securities were held as of april 30 2000

     the hypothetical changes and assumptions discussed above will be different
from what actually occurs in the future furthermore such computations do not
anticipate actions that may be taken by management should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time as a result the effect on actual
earnings in the future will differ from those described above

foreign currency exchange rate risk

     we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to
minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings
we utilize forward contracts to hedge against the shortterm impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every
period we believe that these forward
                                        25
page   27

contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements
because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on
the underlying assets and liabilities

     all contracts have a maturity of less than one year and we do not defer any
gains and losses as they are all accounted for through earnings every period
