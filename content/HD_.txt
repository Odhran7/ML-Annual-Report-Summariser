our business 

our strategy 

the retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years with customer expectations constantly evolving in fiscal 2021 this trend continued due to the challenges created by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the broader domestic and global business environment including supply chain disruptions tight labor market conditions and inflationary pressures to navigate this dynamic environment and meet heightened levels of home improvement demand throughout the year we had to operate with agility while also managing evolving requirements to support customer and associate safety 

our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our strategic investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds going forward we will leverage the momentum of these strategic investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals 

• we intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement 

• we intend to extend our position as the lowcost provider in home improvement and 

• we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement 

we believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders we are steadfast in this commitment while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders including our customers associates supplier partners and communities creates value for all stakeholders including our shareholders 

deliver shareholder value 

we deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation our capital allocation principles are as follows 

• first we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market 

• second after meeting the needs of the business we look to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we intend to increase our dividend as we grow earnings 

in fiscal 2021 we invested 26 billion in capital expenditures to support an interconnected customer experience we also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs the combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle which has allowed us to improve the customer experience increase our competitiveness in the market and deliver shareholder value 

in fiscal 2021 we returned approximately 22 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases we paid 70 billion in cash dividends and returned approximately 150 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases in fiscal 2021 our capital allocation is discussed further in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”

our customers 

we serve two primary customer groups — consumers including both diy and difm customers and professional customers — and have developed varying approaches to meet their diverse needs

interconnected shopping experience 

we continue to enhance our capabilities to provide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores online on the job site and in their homes focusing on continued investments in our website and mobile apps to enhance the digital customer experience 

digital experience enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices view our extended assortment and purchase additional products our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities 

a significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions as a result we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user we have also enhanced the “shopability” of an online product by including more information on the product’s landing page including related products andor parts of a collection and a multitude of fulfillment options our focus on improving search capabilities site functionality category presentation product content speed to checkout and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic better conversion and continued sales growth it has also been critical during the covid19 pandemic as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment 

further we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction rather we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment to postpurchase care and support customers expect more personalized messaging so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and instore experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels from the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product knowhow we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today

strategic risks 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our industry is highly competitive highly fragmented and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online these competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro distributors home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increasing the level of competition we face 

we compete primarily based on customer experience price quality product availability and assortment and delivery options both instore and online we also compete based on store location and appearance presentation of merchandise and ease of shopping experience furthermore customers are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster andor guaranteed delivery times lowprice or free shipping andor convenient pickup options including curbside pickup our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times options and costs depends on many factors including leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins 

we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effective sales and marketing advertising or promotional programs leveraging both our digital and physical platforms our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics shifts in consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions public health issues including pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by government regulators or others or natural disasters while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as our customers expect a more personalized experience our ability to collect use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations our ability to collect and use that data however is subject to a number of external factors including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security in addition each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also increasing if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers are routinely and increasingly using technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices read product reviews determine realtime 

table of contents 

product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick timely and lowprice or free delivery andor convenient pickup options we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process by improving the online customer experience as well as our delivery options the coordinated operation of our network of physical stores distribution facilities and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy we have our boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times options and costs 

in addition a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossselling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance 

failure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations to maintain appropriate inventory to provide quick and lowprice or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment or to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

a positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success and if our brand and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers associates suppliers vendors and shareholders and consequently our business and results of operations or the price of our stock 

our brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers associates suppliers and vendors to do business with us we must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our ability to recruit engage motivate and retain associates attract regulatory scrutiny and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy economic geopolitical or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our company including our products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated negative sentiment about the company shared over social media could impact our brand and reputation whether or not it is based in fact 

the execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy including by making significant investments to expand our supply chain these investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide highquality service to our customers simplify customer interactions provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience and create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement products failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems as well as the development and execution of new processes systems and support building out our supply chain also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network requiring us to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics needed to support the different types of facilities if we are unable to effectively manage the volume timing nature location and cost of these investments projects and changes our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected the cost and potential problems defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers employing new webbased tools and services implementing new technologies implementing and restructuring support systems and processes securing appropriate facility locations and addressing impacts on inventory levels could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term lead to product availability issues and impact our profitability 

in addition our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail strategy serving as the hub of our customers’ interconnected shopping experience we have an aging store base that requires maintenance investment and 

table of contents 

space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory also called “shrink” higher rates of shrink which we continue to experience can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience 

our investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits or might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships maintain favorable terms with current suppliers or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies such as our acquisition of hd supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases cost savings synergies enhanced capabilities or various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty for each of our acquisitions we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company’s products services associates and information technology financial human resources compliance and other systems and processes and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition in addition the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems internal controls technology and cybersecurity systems and operations and make them more difficult to manage furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional risks and liabilities strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty the changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth higher than expected costs the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and other actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

operational risks 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates unemployment levels and health and other insurance costs the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations immigration minimum wage and healthcare benefits changing demographics the continuing impacts of the pandemic and our reputation within the labor market we also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we have faced and may

continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retention of associates due to health and safety concerns vaccine or testing mandates and other governmental requirements disruption in the availability of school or childcare and other challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers these factors together with growing competition among potential employers may result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates which could have an adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in order to execute our interconnected retail strategy including our supply chain investments we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals to implement our ongoing technology and other investments the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive an inability to provide wages andor benefits including remote or hybrid work flexibility that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates further changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs 

additionally our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership and to effectively motivate and retain associates is critical to our business success if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified associates or manage leadership transition successfully our ability to effectively manage our strategy may be negatively impacted the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect analyze process store manage transmit and protect transactions and data some of these systems are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers including certain cloud platform providers in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this operational and financial data for information such as sales customer data associate data demand forecasting merchandise ordering inventory replenishment supply chain management payment processing order fulfillment customer service and postpurchase matters for these information technology systems applications and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must maintain and update them delays in the maintenance updates upgrading or patching of these systems applications or processes could impair and on occasion have impaired their effectiveness or expose us to security risks our systems and the thirdparty systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes including power and other critical infrastructure outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches internal or external data theft or misuse cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing spyware denial of service attacks and ransomware responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems off line natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes or other extreme weather events public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines military conflicts acts of war terrorism or civil unrest other systems outages inadequate or ineffective redundancy and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts are not always successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security impact our ability to operate or access communications financial or banking systems be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with customers suppliers shareholders or regulators 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems infrastructure and personnel in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other thirdparty service providers these investments involve replacing existing systems some of which are older legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient with successor systems outsourcing certain technology and business processes to thirdparty service providers making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced or designing or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality these efforts can result in significant potential risks including failure of the systems to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data changes in security processes and internal controls cost overruns implementation delays or errors disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements any system implementation and transition

difficulty may result in operational challenges security failures reputational harm and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology systems we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms we use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services as methods of providing inspiration and as sources of product project and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales we also have multiple online communities digital platforms and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding with a significant increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a digital and interconnected experience we continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers disruptions delays failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers’ expectations could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers and as a result our financial performance and results of operations 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network such as the industrywide supply chain challenges resulting from the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution or fulfillment centers or those of our supply chain service providers weatherrelated events cybersecurity incidents or attacks natural disasters international trade disputes trade policy changes or restrictions or import or exportrelated governmental sanctions or restrictions quotas tariffs or other importrelated taxes strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shortages of supply chain labor including truck drivers shipping capacity constraints including shortages of related equipment raw material or other shortages thirdparty contract disputes supply or shipping interruptions or costs costs or unavailability of fuel military conflicts or acts of war as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses acts of terrorism public health issues including pandemics or quarantines such as the covid19 pandemic and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by government regulators or others civil unrest or other factors beyond our control in recent years ports in the us and elsewhere have been impacted by capacity constraints port congestion and delays periodic labor disputes security issues weatherrelated events and natural disasters which have been further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic disruptions to our supply chain due to any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the collection processing storage management transmission and deletion of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential and sensitive information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty service providers that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the handling of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties have in the past gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates or thirdparty service providers hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain exploitable vulnerabilities bugs or defects in design maintenance or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security we have experienced and continue to face the ongoing risk of exploitation of our software providers and our software development and implementation process including from coding and process vulnerabilities and the installation of socalled back doors that provide unauthorized access to systems and data the increased use of a remote work infrastructure has also increased the possible attack surfaces in addition the risk of cyberattacks has increased in connection with russia’s invasion of ukraine and the resulting geopolitical conflict in light of those and other geopolitical events nationstate actors or their supporters may launch retaliatory

cyberattacks and may attempt to cause supply chain and other thirdparty service provider disruptions or take other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may disrupt our business operations result in data compromise or both nationstate actors have in the past carried out and may in the future carry out cyberattacks to achieve their aims and goals which may include espionage information operations monetary gain ransomware disruption and destruction to achieve their objectives nationstate actors and other cyber criminals have used and may continue to use numerous attack vectors and methods including use of stolen passwords social engineering phishing identity spoofing ransomware or other disruptive and destructive malware supply chain compromises and maninthemiddle and denial of service attacks the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving increasing in frequency and sophistication and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time 

we have implemented and regularly review and update systems processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss and preserve data integrity however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and business partners must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment as well as those of companies we acquire there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all threats including vulnerabilities data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data as we saw in connection with the data breach we experienced in 2014 any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs including costs to investigate and remediate as well as lost sales fines lawsuits regulatory investigations and damage to our reputation furthermore because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of anomalous activity or compromise we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs 

in addition data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business our business depends on our customers’ and associates’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our customers or our associates of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ and associates’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or malfeasance or that of our service providers or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and harm our reputation further the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business the implementation of these requirements has also become more complex maintaining our compliance with those requirements including recently enacted state consumer privacy laws may require significant effort and cost require changes to our business practices and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a personalized customer experience in addition failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines sanctions governmental investigations lawsuits or reputational damage while we maintain cyber insurance our coverage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit and debit cards our private label credit cards cash checks paypal an installment loan program trade credit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult costly or uncertain for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by threat actors who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our payments and payment processing systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs

incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions climate change natural disasters as well as other catastrophic events could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods droughts tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by government regulators or others civil unrest military conflicts or acts of war as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also temporarily or on a longterm basis disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems and digital platforms resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders to communicate with our stores facilities store support centers or senior management or to access financial or banking systems unseasonable unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs 

furthermore the longterm impacts of climate change whether involving physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels or transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes are expected to be widespread and unpredictable these changes over time could affect for example the availability and cost of certain consumer products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure certain goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require 

as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world who in turn procure materials from around the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by economic or political instability civil unrest military conflicts or acts of war as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses acts of terrorism or violence public health issues including pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by the government the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems raw material or other shortages and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control if we are unable to access products to meet our customers’ demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety and ensure compliance with responsible sourcing laws and standards could damage our reputation with customers expose us to litigation or enforcement actions and negatively impact our sales and results of operations 

product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable product standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality  we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety

concerns including healthrelated concerns could expose us to litigation or government enforcement actions and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and service providers if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even with adequate insurance and indemnification our reputation as a provider of highquality products and services including both national brand names and our proprietary products could suffer damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty in addition we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing which is an increasing focus of government regulators as well all of our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency health and safety environment compensation hours of work and prohibitions on child and forced labor we have a responsible sourcing audit process but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards and applicable law actual potential or perceived supplier noncompliance could expose us to litigation or governmental enforcement actions and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks including regulatory product liability intellectual property supplier relations and reputational risks 

in addition to other productrelated risks discussed in this section as we expand our proprietary product offerings we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional thirdparty licensed and insured installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and handling of environmental risks as well as quality of work performed by our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers however as we experienced in part with our recent epa investigation and resulting consent decree in april 2021 if we fail to manage these processes effectively collect the appropriate documentation perform regular job site inspections or provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines lawsuits or governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements as well as claims for property damage or personal injury in addition we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses which could adversely affect our business 

legal financial regulatory global and other external risks 

uncertainty regarding the housing market economic conditions political and social climate public health issues and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services causing them to delay purchasing decisions or impacting their ability to pay for products and services other factors beyond our control – including unemployment and foreclosure rates inventory loss due to theft interest rate fluctuations inflation or deflation fuel and other energy costs raw material or other shortages labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit changes in tax rates and policy weather natural disasters climate change acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health issues including pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by government regulators or others military conflicts or acts of war as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses and civil unrest

could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance certain merchandise categories have been impacted by higher inflation than that which we have experienced in recent years due to among other things the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic related global supply chain disruptions and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment if inflation increases costs beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices or use our portfolio strategy to sufficiently offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin further our mro customers who have higher spend and longerterm relationships than a typical retail customer primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases and some of our pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products as a result their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their area if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us we may face greater default risk which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our results of operations 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable volatile and uncertain and could adversely affect our business operations demand for our products and services our costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance our exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption uncertainty and volatility all of which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our business while we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful even as efforts to contain the pandemic including vaccinations have fostered progress and as some restrictions have relaxed new variants of the virus have caused additional outbreaks which has introduced additional uncertainty and volatility due to numerous uncertainties and factors beyond our control we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic and recovery efforts will have going forward on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there are additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases including those caused by current or future mutations of the virus or related variants in future periods in areas in which we or our suppliers operate 

• the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and efforts to contain and recover from it and our ability to respond quickly enough or appropriately to those circumstances 

• the duration and degree of governmental business or other actions in response to the pandemic including but not limited to quarantine or shutdown measures and other governmental orders masking vaccination or testing requirements restrictions on our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores facilities and distribution and fulfillment centers economic measures access to unemployment compensation fiscal policy changes or additional measures that may yet be enacted 

• the health of and effect of the pandemic on our associates and our ability to maintain staffing needs to effectively operate our business including the impact of and uncertainty related to vaccination or testing efforts 

• changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers including labor shortages 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates inflation and deflation rising interest rates and recessionary pressures 

• the impact of the pandemic and related economic uncertainty on consumer confidence economic wellbeing spending and shopping behaviors both during and after the pandemic 

• impacts – financial operational or otherwise – on our supply chain including manufacturers or suppliers of our products and logistics or transportation providers and on our service providers subcontractors or other business partners 

• unknown consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response 

• the incremental costs of doing business during andor after the pandemic including the potential costs of ongoing testing requirements 

• volatility in the credit and financial markets during and after the pandemic 

• the effects on our internal control environment and data security as a result of the remote and hybrid work environment

• the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation 

• potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claim costs 

• the availability of and prevalence of access to effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 

• the impact of litigation or claims from customers associates suppliers regulators or other third parties relating to covid19 or our actions in response thereto 

• the pace and extent of recovery as the pandemic subsides and 

• the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business even after the pandemic subsides 

in addition we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic as the pandemic subsides customers may shift more of their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas which may have an adverse impact on our sales 

the above factors and uncertainties or others of which we are not currently aware may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition to the factors above the covid19 pandemic has subjected our business to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in these risk factors 

associate and customer safetyrelated risks  in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our associates customers and others in the communities we serve these measures included among other things increased cleaning and sanitizing measures physical and social distancing efforts continuing curbside pickup from stores and modification of certain annual merchandising events in certain jurisdictions we temporarily ceased sales or delayed commencement of certain inhome services deemed nonessential early in the pandemic and we may have to do so again or in other jurisdictions several of these actions adversely impacted our sales and they may continue to do so going forward we also took other steps to support our associates including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of covid19 while we have transitioned from many of these temporary pay and benefits programs the actions that we have taken in response to the pandemic resulted in significant incremental costs and we expect that we will continue to incur additional costs due to the pandemic going forward which in turn may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the health and safety of our associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team however due to the unpredictable nature of covid19 and the consequences of our actions we may see unexpected outcomes from our added safety measures or from rolling back safety measures as conditions evolve for example if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our customers or associates do not participate in social distancing vaccination efforts and other safety measures or if rolling back safety measures results in additional outbreaks the wellbeing of our associates and customers could be at risk furthermore any failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response could cause reputational harm to our brand andor subject us to claims and litigation from associates customers suppliers regulators or other third parties additionally we have faced and may continue to face periodic labor shortages at our stores and facilities due to covid19 which can result in modifications to our operations including temporary closures and negatively impact our business costs and results of operations 

additionally some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers’ compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures these actions may increase our exposure to workers’ compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance 

information technologyrelated risks  as a result of the pandemic and related quarantines shutdown orders and similar restrictions we have experienced increased demand for online purchases of products while we have managed this increased volume to date without interruption there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to do so we have also had to rapidly modify certain technology systems to support our interconnected offerings in connection with the pandemic such as the addition of curbside pickup disruptions failures or other performance issues with our customerfacing technology systems either due to increased volume system modifications or other factors could impair the benefits they provide adversely impact our sales and negatively affect our relationship with our customers in addition as more business activities have shifted online as a result of the covid19 pandemic and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks 

supply chainrelated risks  circumstances related to the covid19 pandemic have significantly impacted the global supply chain with restrictions and limitations on business activities and impacts of the covid19 pandemic

causing cost increases labor shortages capacity constraints disruptions and delays these issues which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic are placing strain on the domestic and international supply chain which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed which has challenged our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand these factors have resulted in higher outofstock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to our distribution and fulfillment centers stores or customers even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition similarly increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations as well as those of our thirdparty carriers resulting in delays in delivering products to customers the operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations we have experienced and may continue to experience labor shortages at and temporary closures of some of our distribution and fulfillment centers and any such labor shortages or closures whether temporary or sustained may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to adversely affect the us and global economy andor to adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section and other sec filings including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition brand and reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and regulatory requirements 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations have become increasingly complex these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data privacy and cybersecurity the sale marketing sourcing and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics and interstate delivery operations including department of transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers international trade supply chain transparency taxes including changes to corporate tax rates restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions competition and antitrust requirements esg performance transparency and reporting unclaimed property energy costs and consumption or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters including with respect to our installation services business could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales operations or profitability 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints as well as political social and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences international trade disputes trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes and controls greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on access to ports risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance military conflicts or acts of war as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses compliance with forced labor laws and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers for example trade tensions between the us and china have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories as a portion of our retail products are sourced directly or indirectly outside of the us major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of demand for and profitability of retail product sales in our us locations 

table of contents 

other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

the inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand inflationary pressures labor costs competition market speculation government regulations tariffs and trade restrictions natural disasters and periodic delays in delivery in addition russia’s invasion of ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts as well as any related international response may exacerbate inflationary pressures including causing increases in commodity prices as well as fuel and other energy costs rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices such as changes in lumber prices and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured for a number of different risk categories such as general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical automobile claims and network security and privacy liability with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters business combinations and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments including due to uncertainty in the current environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process internal controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

we are involved in a number of legal regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings as well as compliance with any settlements or consent decrees that result from those proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

executive summary 

the following table presents highlights of our annual financial performance 



we reported net sales of 1512 billion in fiscal 2021 net earnings were 164 billion or 1553 per diluted share we opened five new stores in the us and two new stores in mexico during fiscal 2021 resulting in a total store count of 2317 at january 30 2022 which includes 14 stores in the us from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 at the end of fiscal 2021 a total of 311 of our stores or 134 were located in canada and mexico total sales per retail square foot were 60474 in fiscal 2021 our inventory turnover ratio was 52 times at the end of fiscal 2021 compared to 58 times at the end of fiscal 2020 the decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment 

we generated 166 billion of cash flow from operations issued 30 billion of longterm debt net of discounts and received 10 billion of net proceeds from shortterm debt during fiscal 2021 this cash flow together with cash on hand was used to fund cash payments of 148 billion for share repurchases pay 70 billion of dividends fund 26 billion in capital expenditures and repay an aggregate of 15 billion of longterm debt in february 2022 we announced a 15 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 190 per share 

our roic was 447 for fiscal 2021 and 408 for fiscal 2020 see the “ nongaap financial measures ” section below for our definition and calculation of roic as well as a reconciliation of nopat a nongaap financial measure to net earnings the most comparable gaap financial measure

1 does not include results for hd supply including the legacy interline brands business which was integrated into hd supply during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

2 average ticket represents the average price paid per transaction and is used by management to monitor the performance of the company as it represents a primary driver in measuring sales performance 

3 sales per retail square foot represents sales divided by retail store square footage sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the company’s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

sales we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales 

net sales  net sales for fiscal 2021 increased 190 billion or 144 to 1512 billion the increase in net sales for fiscal 2021 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket as well as sales from hd supply which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 we saw continued elevated home improvement demand which began at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with strong performance across our departments as customers continued to focus on home improvement projects and repairs a weaker us dollar positively impacted sales growth by 760 million in fiscal 2021 

table of contents 

online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 137 of net sales and grew by 94 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in online sales in fiscal 2021 was driven by customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms for their shopping needs 

comparable sales  comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes sales at all locations physical and online open greater than 52 weeks including remodels and relocations and excludes closed stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 52 nd week of operation acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap 

total comparable sales increased 114 in fiscal 2021 reflecting an 117 increase in comparable average ticket and nearly flat comparable customer transactions when compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including strong home improvement demand and benefits from our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds as well as inflation the increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation an increase in bigticket transactions elevated project demand and strong demand for new and innovative products 

during fiscal 2021 all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales and 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted doubledigit positive comparable sales led by kitchen and bath and lumber when compared to fiscal 2020 our outdoor garden hardware indoor garden and paint departments had singledigit positive comparable sales when compared to fiscal 2020 

gross profit gross profit increased 60 billion or 133 to 508 billion in fiscal 2021 gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 336 in fiscal 2021 compared to 340 in fiscal 2020 the decrease in gross profit margin reflected pressure from product mix investments in our supply chain network and higher product and transportation costs offset by the benefit from higher retail prices 

operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sga and depreciation and amortization 

selling general  administrative  sga increased 10 billion or 39 to 254 billion in fiscal 2021 as a percent of net sales sga was 168 for fiscal 2021 compared to 185 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment along with cycling total covid19related expenses of 21 billion and transactionrelated expenses associated with the acquisition of hd supply of 110 million incurred during fiscal 2020 these benefits were partially offset by an increase in hourly payrollrelated costs in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by wage investments we made in the latter part of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021 total covid19related expenses incurred during fiscal 2021 were 262 million 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased 258 million or 121 to 24 billion in fiscal 2021 as a percent of net sales depreciation and amortization was 16 for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 primarily reflecting leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business as well as higher intangible asset amortization expense 

interest and other net interest and other net was 13 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 09 for fiscal 2021 compared to 10 for fiscal 2020 primarily reflecting leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment 

provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 244 for fiscal 2021 compared to 242 for fiscal 2020 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were 1553 for fiscal 2021 compared to 1194 for fiscal 2020 the increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the factors discussed above as well as share repurchases

nongaap financial measures 

to provide clarity about our operating performance we supplement our reporting with certain nongaap financial measures however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures nongaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies 

return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base we define roic as nopat a nongaap financial measure for the most recent twelvemonth period divided by average debt and equity we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending longterm debt including current installments and equity for the most recent twelvemonth period 

the following table presents the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap measure 



————— 

1 income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months 

2 the beginning balance of equity for fiscal 2019 was adjusted to reflect an immaterial opening balance sheet adjustment due to the adoption of accounting standards codification topic 842 leases in fiscal 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 30 2022 we had 23 billion in cash and cash equivalents of which 13 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our current cash position cash flow generated from operations funds available from our commercial paper programs and access to the longterm debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures fund dividend payments fund any share repurchases make any required debt payments and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years in addition we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary 

our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business these obligations primarily include longterm debt and related interest payments operating and finance lease obligations and purchase obligations see below for additional details regarding these material cash requirements 

in addition to our cash requirements we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation this approach first prioritizes investing in the business with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases for fiscal 2022 we plan to invest approximately 3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis compared to 26 billion in fiscal 2021 however we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business to enhance longterm strategic positioning or in response to the economic environment as necessary or appropriate 

during fiscal 2021 we paid cash dividends of 70 billion to shareholders in february 2022 we also announced a 15 increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 165 to 190 per share we intend to pay a dividend in the future however any future dividend is subject to declaration by the board of directors based on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 

table of contents 

in may 2021 our board of directors approved a 200 billion share repurchase authorization of which 96 billion remained available as of january 30 2022 this new authorization replaced the previous authorization of 150 billion which was approved in february 2019 and does not have a prescribed expiration date during fiscal 2021 we had cash payments of 148 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases the amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions 

debt 

at january 30 2022 we had commercial paper programs that allowed for borrowings up to 30 billion in connection with these programs we had backup credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 30 billion at january 30 2022 which consisted of a fiveyear 20 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2023 and a 364day 10 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2022 in december 2021 we completed the renewal of our 364day 10 billion credit facility extending the maturity from december 2021 to december 2022 at january 30 2022 there were 10 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy in september 2021 we issued 30 billion of senior notes and the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares of our common stock we also repaid 135 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2021 at january 30 2022 we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of 364 billion with 23 billion payable within 12 months future interest payments associated with these senior notes total 209 billion with 12 billion payable within 12 months based on current interest rates which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements 

the indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity the indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants however none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements 

leases 

we use operating and finance leases to fund a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers at january 30 2022 we had aggregate lease obligations of 126 billion with 13 billion payable within 12 months aggregate lease obligations include 13 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases 

purchase obligations and other 

purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases media and sponsorship spend software acquisitions license commitments and legally binding service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business which are typically cancellable by their terms therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments at january 30 2022 we had aggregate purchase obligations of 21 billion with 12 billion payable within 12 months 

at january 30 2022 we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling 570 million none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months the timing of payment if any associated with our longterm unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements

cash flows summary 

operating activities cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we make for products and services associate compensation operations occupancy costs and income taxes 

cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 23 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital partially offset by an increase in net earnings working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs along with timing of vendor payments 

investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased by 72 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to 78 billion of net consideration paid to acquire hd supply in fiscal 2020 partially offset by increased capital expenditures 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected 148 billion of share repurchases 70 billion of cash dividends paid and 15 billion of repayments of longterm debt partially offset by 30 billion of net proceeds from longterm debt and 10 billion of net proceeds from shortterm debt 

cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected 65 billion of cash dividends paid 29 billion of repayments of longterm debt 974 million of net repayments of shortterm debt and 791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in march 2020 partially offset by 79 billion of net proceeds from longterm debt 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

merchandise inventories 

we value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the firstin firstout method with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method under the retail inventory method inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories 

table of contents 

the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups markdowns and inventory losses or shrink as such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand customer preferences and buying trends age of the merchandise and weather conditions 

we calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a storespecific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results a 10 increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have increased cost of sales by approximately 100 million for fiscal 2021 historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results 

due to changes in operating conditions during fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we used the results from a sample of stores that were able to conduct physical inventories as a basis for estimating shrink for those stores at which physical inventory counts were temporarily suspended during fiscal 2020 we believe the sample of stores that were selected for inventory counts in fiscal 2020 provided a reasonable basis for estimating shrink where a physical inventory count was not performed in fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2021 we performed all regularly scheduled physical inventory counts including store locations where physical inventory counts were suspended during fiscal 2020 and the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses was not material 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions of variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation 

if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows we then measure the asset’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for locations identified for closure or relocation we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations for operating locations we generally base our fair value estimates on future cash flow projections as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows impairments of longlived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019 

uncertain tax positions 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in multiple jurisdictions across our global operations thus the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretations and application of complex tax law our provision for income taxes could be affected by many factors including changes in business operations changes in tax law outcomes of income tax audits changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies the impact of discrete tax items and the mix of earnings among our us and foreign operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves complexity and thus there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax positions requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we record the benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will be sustained 

table of contents 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available and requires a significant amount of management judgment for the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use an income approach significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates customer attrition rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill during the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

for information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our longterm debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio none of which are for trading or speculative purposes at january 30 2022 after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements floating rate debt principal was 57 billion or approximately 16 of our senior notes portfolio and the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements totaled 191 million the changes in the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged longterm debt based on our january 30 2022 floating rate debt principal a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floatingrate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 57 million 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced the phased cessation of publication of libor beginning after 2021 and continuing through 2023 while the discontinuance of libor tenors that are scheduled to occur in 2023 will impact certain of our credit arrangements and interest rate swaps we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies we use derivative and nonderivative instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk none of which are for trading or speculative purposes our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 were not material 

commodity price risk we experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products this price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition andor our results of operations in order to mitigate price volatility we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly however our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage these risks

our business 

our strategy 

the retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years with customer expectations constantly evolving and the agility required to meet these expectations increasing in fiscal 2020 this trend was accelerated due to the covid19 pandemic which both spurred significant growth in home improvement demand and drove operational changes required to promote customer and associate safety 

our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers in the pandemic environment successfully was due in significant part to the transformational journey we began in 2017 to create the one home depot experience our vision of an interconnected frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds our multiyear accelerated investment program to create this experience is now largely complete our investments have been guided by the following strategies 

• invest using a “customerback” approach 

• reinforce our position as the product authority in home improvement 

• deliver a bestinclass interconnected shopping experience 

• extend our lowcost provider position 

these strategic investments are designed to extend our current competitive advantages we believe our primary competitive advantages are 1 our culture and associates 2 our premium real estate 3 our worldclass merchandising organization 4 our flexible supply chain and 5 our digital experience taken together our one home depot vision and execution of the related strategies are helping us to meet our two principal business objectives continue to grow our share of the highly competitive market in which we operate and deliver shareholder value we believe that our efforts to build the one home depot experience and the groundwork we laid in these areas over the past decade position us well to meet our objectives in any environment and have been particularly important in navigating the challenges created by the pandemic we achieved record sales in fiscal 2020 while remaining focused on two key priorities the safety and wellbeing of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with the products and services they need 

we also remained focused on our objective to return value to our shareholders we are steadfast in this commitment while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders including our customers associates supplier partners and communities creates value for all stakeholders including our shareholders 

our customers 

we serve two primary customer groups consumers including both diy and difm customers and professional customers and have developed different approaches to meet their diverse needs 

diy customers these customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources 

table of contents 

and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge we also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our diy customers 

professional customers or “pros”  these customers are primarily professional renovatorsremodelers general contractors handymen property managers building service contractors and specialty tradesmen such as electricians plumbers and painters these customers build renovate remodel repair and maintain residential properties multifamily properties hospitality properties and commercial facilities including education healthcare government institutional and office buildings and facilities 

we have a number of initiatives to drive growth with our pro customers including a customized online experience a dedicated sales force an extensive delivery network enhanced credit offerings and inventory management programs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we extended our reach in the mro marketplace with our acquisition of hd supply a leading national distributor of mro products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets our mro operations use a distribution centerbased model that sells products primarily through a professional sales force ecommerce and print catalogs we recognize the great value our pro customers provide to their clients and we strive to make their jobs easier and help them grow their businesses we believe that investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our pro customers are yielding increased engagement and will continue to translate into incremental spend 

difm customers intersecting our diy customers and our pros are our difm customers these customers are typically homeowners who use pros to complete their project or installation currently we offer installation services in a variety of categories such as flooring cabinets and cabinet makeovers countertops furnaces and central air systems and windows difm customers can purchase these services in our stores online or in their homes through inhome consultations in addition to serving our difm customer needs we believe our focus on the pros who perform services for these customers helps us drive higher product sales 

our products and services 

we believe our merchandising organization is a key competitive advantage which we maintain by delivering product innovation assortment and value which reinforces our position as the product authority in home improvement in fiscal 2020 we continued to invest in merchandising resets in our stores to refine assortments introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our diy and pro customers and improve visual merchandising to drive a better shopping experience at the same time we remain focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online 

a typical the home depot store stocks approximately 30000 to 40000 items during the year including both national brand name and proprietary products our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites including homedepotcom our primary website blindscom our online site for custom window coverings and thecompanystorecom our online site for textiles and décor products 

to help our merchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innovation localization and personalization we are continuing to invest in tools to better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with supplier partners as a result we have continued to focus on enhanced merchandising information technology tools to help us 1 build an interconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers’ personas shopping context and location 2 ensure we have the best value in the market and 3 optimize our product assortments 

to complement our merchandising efforts we offer a number of services for our customers including special programs for our pro customers to meet their particular needs and installation services for our diy and difm customers we also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1300 locations across the us and canada providing value and convenience for both our pro and diy customers to improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering we are continuing to invest in more locations more tools and better technology 

sourcing and quality assurance we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain highquality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world during fiscal 2020 in addition to our us sourcing operations we maintained sourcing offices in mexico canada china india vietnam and europe to ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility we also have a global responsible sourcing program our suppliers are contractually obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international federal state and local laws all of our suppliers must also comply with our responsible sourcing standards which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency health and safety environment compensation hours of work and prohibitions on child and forced 

table of contents 

labor to drive accountability with our suppliers we conduct factory audits and compliance visits our 2020 responsible sourcing report available on our website at httpscorporatehomedepotcomresponsibilitysourcingresponsibility provides more information about this program in addition we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ® trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business including our proprietary brands such as hdx ®  husky ®  hampton bay ®  home decorators collection ®  glacier bay ®  vigoro ®  everbilt ® and lifeproof ®  the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary although our patents have value no single patent is essential to our business we will continue to assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within the home depot’s portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands 

competition and seasonality 

our industry is highly competitive very fragmented and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online these competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increasing the level of competition we face 

we compete primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options both instore and online we also compete based on store location and appearance presentation of merchandise and ease of shopping experience furthermore with respect to delivery options customers are increasingly seeking faster andor guaranteed delivery times lowprice or free shipping andor convenient pickup options including curbside pickup our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times options and costs depends on many factors including the success of our supply chain investments described more fully under “one supply chain” below 

our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter 

interconnected shopping experience 

our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago as a result we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores online on the job site and in their homes focusing on continued investments in our website and mobile apps to enhance the digital customer experience 

digital experience enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices view our extended assortment and purchase additional products our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities 

many of our interconnected customers are also comfortable with a purely online shopping experience a significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions as a result we have made significant investments to our digital properties to 

table of contents 

improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user we have also enhanced the “shopability” of an online product by including more information on the product’s landing page including related products andor parts of a collection and a multitude of fulfillment options our focus on improving search capabilities site functionality category presentation product content speed to checkout and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic better conversion and continued sales growth it has also been critical during the pandemic as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment 

further we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction rather we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment to postpurchase care and support most of which takes place in the digital world from the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product knowhow we are investing in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today customers expect more personalized messaging so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and instore experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels 

store experience our stores remain the hub of our business and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout for several years our associates have used our first phones to help expedite the online order checkout process locate products in the aisles and online and check inventory on hand to improve the customer’s experience in our stores we have also empowered our customers with additional selfhelp tools including mobile appenabled store navigation our app provides storespecific maps which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices 

we have also made significant progress in our strategic store investments in fiscal 2020 we completed the implementation of our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our us stores this package included more intuitive signage better lighting and other store enhancements to support our interconnected growth we continued the roll out of selfservice lockers and online order storage areas at the front entrance to offer convenient pickup of online orders we also tested our electronic shelf label capabilities used initially in our appliance department in additional merchandising departments our store investments also include the redesign of the front end area including reconfigured service desks improved layouts in all checkout areas and expanded and enhanced selfcheckout options we completed the upgrade to our selfcheckout machines in fiscal 2019 however due to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic we paused the updates of the rest of our front ends as we continue to learn the new ways our customers interact with our stores we will resume upgrades as appropriate we believe the investments we have made to date are driving higher customer satisfaction scores 

investing in associate productivity  we continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers to this end we have focused our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve onshelf product availability creating a simpler order management system expanding inaisle realtime mobile learning tools for our associates’ own development and to assist with customer questions and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs 

investing in safety  we are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates we empower trained ehs associates to evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate’s role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and an understanding of ehs matters we also implemented a number of additional measures for the safety of our associates and customers in response to the covid19 pandemic

deliver shareholder value 

we deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation our first use of cash is to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market in fiscal 2020 we achieved this growth through our continued investments to create the one home depot experience we also focus on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs the combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and lowering costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle which has allowed us to improve the customer experience increase our competitiveness in the market and deliver shareholder value 

the use of the remainder of our cash is guided by our shareholder return principles 

• dividend principle we look to increase our dividend every year as we grow earnings 

• return on invested capital principle our goal is to maintain a high return on invested capital benchmarking all uses of excess liquidity against the value created for our shareholders through share repurchases 

• share repurchase principle after meeting the needs of the business we will look to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases 

following these principles we increased our dividend in february 2020 returning value to shareholders through 65 billion in cash dividends which we maintained throughout the year we had cash payments of 791 million for share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 until we suspended share repurchases in march 2020 to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the business during the pandemic share repurchases remain part of our strategy for returning value to shareholders and we resumed our share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 our capital allocation is discussed further in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

strategic risks 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our industry is highly competitive highly fragmented and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online these competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increasing the level of competition we face 

we compete primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options both instore and online we also compete based on store location and appearance presentation of merchandise and ease of shopping experience furthermore customers are increasingly seeking faster andor guaranteed delivery times lowprice or free shipping andor convenient pickup options including curbside pickup our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times options and costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one supply chain and the one home depot experience and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins 

we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional programs our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions public health 

table of contents 

issues including pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by the government or natural disasters while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as our customers begin to expect a more personalized experience our ability to collect use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations our ability to collect and use that data however is subject to a number of external factors including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security in addition each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices read product reviews determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick timely and lowprice or free delivery andor convenient pickup options we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have our boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times options and costs 

in addition a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossselling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance 

failure to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs to maintain appropriate inventory to provide quick and lowprice or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

a positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success and if our brand and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers associates suppliers and vendors and consequently our business and results of operations 

our brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers associates suppliers and vendors to do business with us we must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our ability to recruit engage motivate and retain associates attract regulatory scrutiny and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our company including our products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated negative sentiment about the company shared over social media could impact our brand and reputation whether or not it is based in fact 

the implementation of initiatives to build one supply chain and create the one home depot experience could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have been substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience including significant investments over several years to build one supply chain these investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide highquality service to our customers simplify customer interactions provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience and create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement products failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations creating the one home depot experience requires significant investment in our operations and information technology systems as well as the development and execution of new processes systems and support building one supply chain also involves 

table of contents 

significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network if we are unable to effectively manage the volume timing nature and cost of these investments projects and changes our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected the cost and potential problems defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers employing new webbased tools and services implementing new technologies implementing and restructuring support systems and processes identifying appropriate facility locations and addressing impacts on inventory levels could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term lead to product availability issues and impact our profitability 

in addition our stores are a key element of the one home depot experience by serving as the hub of our customers’ interconnected shopping experience we have an aging store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory also called “shrink” higher rates of shrink which we continue to experience can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience 

creating the one home depot experience and building one supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to complete these initiatives or realize the anticipated benefits or these initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships maintain favorable terms with current suppliers or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we acquired hd supply a leading national distributor of mro products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of the hd supply acquisition and our other transactions is subject to significant uncertainty for each of our acquisitions we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company’s products services associates and information technology financial human resources compliance and other systems and processes and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition in addition the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems internal controls and operations and make them more difficult to manage furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth higher than expected costs the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and other actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

operational risks 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs 

table of contents 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates unemployment levels and health and other insurance costs the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations immigration minimum wage and healthcare benefits changing demographics and our reputation within the labor market we also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market 

in addition in order to continue to create the one home depot experience and build one supply chain we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals to implement our ongoing technology and other strategic investments the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates further changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs 

additionally our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified associates or manage leadership transition successfully the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data some of these systems are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers including certain cloud platform providers in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this operational and financial data for information such as sales customer data associate data demand forecasting merchandise ordering inventory replenishment supply chain management payment processing order fulfillment customer service and postpurchase matters for these information technology systems applications and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must maintain and update them delays in the maintenance updates upgrading or patching of these systems applications or processes could impair and on occasion have impaired their effectiveness or expose us to security risks our systems and the thirdparty systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes including power and other critical infrastructure outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches internal or external data theft or misuse cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing spyware denial of service attacks and ransomware responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems off line natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes or other extreme weather events public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines acts of war terrorism or civil unrest other systems outages inadequate or ineffective redundancy and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts are not always successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems infrastructure and personnel in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other thirdparty service providers these investments involve replacing existing systems some of which are older legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient with successor systems outsourcing certain technology to thirdparty service providers making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced or designing or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality these efforts can result in significant potential risks including failure of the systems to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data changes in security processes and internal controls cost overruns implementation delays or errors disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges security failures reputational harm and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology systems we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms we use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and services and also as methods of providing inspiration as well as product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales we also have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience we continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers disruptions delays failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers’ expectations could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution or fulfillment centers weatherrelated events natural disasters international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions tariffs or importrelated taxes thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shortages of supply chain labor including truck drivers shipping capacity constraints including shortages of related equipment thirdparty contract disputes supply or shipping interruptions or costs military conflicts acts of terrorism public health issues including pandemics or quarantines such as the covid19 pandemic and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by the government civil unrest or other factors beyond our control in recent years us ports particularly those located on the west coast have been impacted by capacity constraints port congestion and delays periodic labor disputes security issues weatherrelated events and natural disasters which have been further exacerbated by the pandemic disruptions to our supply chain due to any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the collection storage management transmission and deletion of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential and sensitive information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty vendors and service providers that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the collection storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties have in the past gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates or thirdparty service providers hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design maintenance or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security we face the risk of exploitation of our software providers and our software development and implementation process including from coding and process vulnerabilities and the installation of socalled back doors that provide unauthorized access to systems and data the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update our systems processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment as well as those of any companies we acquire there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data as we have experienced any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs including costs to investigate and remediate as well as lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation furthermore because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement

adequate preventative measures and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs 

in addition data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business our business depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information events that adversely affect that trust including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ sensitive information secure from significant attack theft damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access whether as a result of our action or inaction including human error or malfeasance or that of our service providers or other third parties could adversely affect our brand and reputation further the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business the implementation of these requirements has also become more complex maintaining our compliance with those requirements including recently enacted state consumer privacy laws may require significant effort and cost require changes to our business practices and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a personalized customer experience in addition failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines sanctions governmental investigations lawsuits or reputational damage 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit and debit cards our private label credit cards cash checks paypal an installment loan program trade credit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult costly or uncertain for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by threat actors who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our payments and payment processing systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters as well as other catastrophic events could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by the government civil unrest or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also temporarily or on a longterm basis disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems and digital platforms resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores unseasonable unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks including regulatory product liability intellectual property supplier relations and reputational risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings in addition to other productrelated risks discussed in this section we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services causing them to delay purchasing decisions or impacting their ability to pay for products and services other factors beyond our control – including unemployment and foreclosure rates inventory loss due to theft interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit changes in tax rates and policy weather natural disasters acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health issues including pandemics and quarantines and related shutdowns reopenings or other actions by the government civil unrest and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance further our mro customers who have higher spend and longerterm relationships than a typical retail customer primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases as a result their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their area 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable volatile and uncertain and could adversely affect our business operations demand for our products and services our costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance our exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption uncertainty and volatility all of which have impacted and may continue to impact our business while we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful similarly the recovery from the pandemic including the widespread rollout of vaccines introduces additional uncertainty and volatility 

due to numerous uncertainties and factors beyond our control we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic and the recovery will have going forward on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there are additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases including those caused by current or future mutations or related strains of the virus in future periods in areas in which we or our suppliers operate 

• the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and efforts to recover from it and our ability to respond quickly enough or appropriately to those circumstances 

• the duration and degree of governmental business or other actions in response to the pandemic including but not limited to quarantine or shutdown measures and other governmental orders restrictions on our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores facilities and distribution and fulfillment centers economic measures access to unemployment compensation fiscal policy changes or additional measures that may yet be enacted 

• the health of and effect of the pandemic on our associates and our ability to maintain staffing needs to effectively operate our business including the impact of and uncertainty related to vaccination efforts 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

• the impact of the pandemic and related economic uncertainty on consumer confidence economic wellbeing spending and shopping behaviors both during and after the pandemic 

• impacts – financial operational or otherwise – on our supply chain including manufacturers or suppliers of our products and logistics or transportation providers and on our service providers or subcontractors 

• unknown consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response including further delays in or adjustments to our strategic investments 

table of contents 

• the incremental costs of doing business during andor after the pandemic 

• volatility in the credit and financial markets during and after the pandemic 

• the potential effects on our internal control environment and data security as a result of changes to a remote work environment 

• the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation 

• potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claim costs 

• the availability of and prevalence of access to effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 

• the impact of litigation or claims from customers associates suppliers regulators or other third parties relating to covid19 or our actions in response thereto 

• the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides and 

• the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business 

in addition we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic as customers have focused on their homes and have spent less on other items like travel and entertainment as the pandemic begins to subside customers may shift their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas which may have an adverse impact on our sales 

the above factors and uncertainties or others of which we are not currently aware may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition to the factors above the covid19 pandemic has subjected our business to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

associate and customer safetyrelated risks  in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our associates customers and others in the communities we serve these measures include among other things adjusted store hours increased cleaning and sanitizing measures limits on customer traffic in stores to maintain physical and social distancing protocols other physical and social distancing efforts such as markings on floors signage plexiglass shields and mask requirements providing masks and thermometers to associates in stores and distribution and fulfillment centers instituting curbside pickup from stores and cancellation or modification of certain annual merchandising events to avoid driving additional traffic to stores that might undermine our efforts to prioritize safety in certain jurisdictions we temporarily ceased sales or delayed commencement of certain inhome services deemed nonessential early in the pandemic and we may have to do so again or in other jurisdictions several of these actions adversely impacted our sales and they may continue to do so going forward we also took other steps to support our associates including expanding our paid time off policy to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates are facing as a result of covid19 instituting weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution and fulfillment centers temporarily providing double pay for overtime worked and expanding dependent care benefits in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we began transitioning from these temporary pay and benefits programs to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates the actions that we have taken in response to the pandemic have resulted in significant incremental costs and we expect that we will continue to incur additional costs due to the pandemic going forward which in turn will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the health and safety of our associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team however due to the unpredictable nature of covid19 and the consequences of our actions we may see unexpected outcomes from our added safety measures for example if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our customers or associates do not participate in social distancing and other safety measures the wellbeing of our associates and customers could be at risk furthermore any failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response could cause reputational harm to our brand andor subject us to claims and litigation from associates customers suppliers regulators or other third parties additionally we have faced and may continue to face periodic labor shortages at our stores and facilities due to covid19 which can result in modifications to our operations including temporary closures and negatively impact our business costs and results of operations 

additionally some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers’ compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures these actions may increase our exposure to workers’ compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance 

information technologyrelated risks  as a result of the pandemic and related quarantines shutdown orders and similar restrictions we have experienced increased demand for online purchases of products while we have managed this increased volume to date without interruption there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to do so we have also had to rapidly modify certain technology to support our interconnected offerings in 

table of contents 

connection with the pandemic such as the addition of curbside pickup disruptions failures or other performance issues with our customerfacing technology systems either due to the increased volume system modifications or other factors could impair the benefits they provide adversely impact our sales and negatively affect our relationship with our customers in addition as more business activities have shifted online due to covid19 restrictions and as many of our store support associates are working remotely we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks 

supply chainrelated risks  circumstances related to the covid19 pandemic have significantly impacted the global supply chain with restrictions and limitations on business activities and impacts of the covid19 pandemic causing labor shortages capacity constraints disruptions and delays these issues which may expand depending on the progression of the pandemic are placing strain on the domestic and international supply chain which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed which has challenged our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand these factors have resulted in higher outofstock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to our distribution and fulfillment centers stores or customers even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition similarly increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations as well as those of our thirdparty carriers resulting in delays in delivering products to customers the operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations we have experienced and may continue to experience labor shortages at and temporary closures of some of our distribution and fulfillment centers and any such labor shortages or closures whether temporary or sustained may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation 

financial and liquidity risks  in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating the covid19 pandemic we took proactive steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including suspending share repurchases expanding our commercial paper program and related revolving credit facility capacity and issuing incremental longterm debt the increased debt levels have increased our interest expense further the financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if the impacts of the pandemic and the related recovery continue to create severe disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt or other sources of external liquidity additionally changes in our capital allocation strategy could have adverse impacts both short and longterm on our results of operations and financial position suspension of share repurchases impacts our earnings per share and return on invested capital which in turn could adversely impact our stock price we resumed our share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 although the amount and continuation of those repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic and pandemic environment while not contemplated at this time any potential suspension or reduction in our dividend declaration could have an adverse impact on investor perception and our stock price 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the us and global economy andor to adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section and other sec filings including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition brand and reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and regulatory requirements 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations have become increasingly complex these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt

employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data privacy and cybersecurity the sale marketing and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics and interstate delivery operations including department of transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers international trade supply chain transparency taxes including changes to corporate tax rates unclaimed property energy costs and consumption or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters including with respect to our installation services business could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations 

in fiscal 2017 congress enacted the tax act which significantly changed how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced since the enactment of the tax act additional guidance has been issued by the us department of the treasury the irs and other standardsetting bodies whose interpretations could differ from our interpretations further in addition to uncertainties that continue to exist in terms of how us states will react to the tax act recently enacted changes in foreign countries within which we operate could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints as well as political social and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences international trade disputes trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes and controls greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on access to ports risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers for example trade tensions between the us and china have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories as a portion of our retail products are sourced directly or indirectly outside of the us major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of demand for and profitability of retail product sales in our us locations other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations tariffs and trade restrictions and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices such as changes in lumber prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured for a number of different risk categories such as general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical automobile claims and network security and privacy liability with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters business combinations and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or 

table of contents 

changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments including due to uncertainty in the current environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process internal control and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

we are involved in a number of legal regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings as well as compliance with any settlements or consent decrees that result from those proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

we reported net sales of 1321 billion in fiscal 2020 net earnings were 129 billion or 1194 per diluted share we opened two new stores in mexico and three new stores in the us during fiscal 2020 for a total store count of 2296 at january 31 2021 at the end of fiscal 2020 a total of 309 of our stores or 135 were located in canada and mexico total sales per retail square foot were 54374 in fiscal 2020 our inventory turnover ratio was 58 times at the end of fiscal 2020 up from 49 times last year driven by a significant increase in customer demand across core merchandising departments 

we generated 188 billion of cash flow from operations and issued 79 billion of longterm debt net of discounts and premiums during fiscal 2020 these funds together with cash on hand were used to acquire hd supply for net consideration of 78 billion pay 65 billion of dividends repay an aggregate of 29 billion of longterm debt fund 25 billion in capital expenditures repay 974 million of net shortterm borrowings and fund cash payments of 791 million for share repurchases before we suspended share repurchases in march 2020 we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in february 2021 we announced a 10 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 165 per share

covid19 

the outbreak of the covid19 coronavirus which was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 has led to adverse impacts on the us and global economies and has impacted and continues to impact our supply chain operations and customer demand even though the company has taken measures to adapt to operating in this challenging environment the pandemic could further affect our operations and the 

table of contents 

operations of our suppliers and vendors as a result of additional shutdowns or other governmental orders restrictions and limitations on travel logistics and other business activities potential product and labor shortages limitations on store or facility operations up to and including closures and other governmental business or consumer actions as circumstances have evolved our focus has been and continues to be on two key priorities the safety and wellbeing of our associates and customers and providing our customers and communities with the products and services that they need 

as we adapted to operations in a covid19 environment during fiscal 2020 we took a number of actions to promote social and physical distancing at the beginning of the pandemic we implemented a change to store operating hours and we took measures to limit the number of customers in stores which included canceling or modifying certain annual merchandising events and rolling out curbside pickup at our stores we also shifted store support operations to remote or virtual as we have continued to adapt and refine our approach we have adjusted our response to better manage growing demand in the stores including adopting a more localized approach on customer limits and expanding store hours while still focusing on promoting a safe shopping environment in addition masks or facial coverings are required for all associates and customers in our us stores and other facilities 

the impact of covid19 and the actions we have taken in response to it had varying effects on our results of operations throughout fiscal 2020 overall we saw a significant acceleration in sales with strong performance across our departments as customers have focused on home improvement projects and repairs as our customers continued to seek alternative methods for obtaining the products they needed online sales grew by approximately 86 in fiscal 2020 

the increase in customer demand for certain products together with the impact of covid19 on our supply chain has put pressure on our ability to maintain high instock levels particularly for certain high demand products we have been able to mitigate some of the impact however due to the benefits from our strategic investments and by working crossfunctionally and partnering with our suppliers to make realtime adjustments to our product assortments introducing alternative products or reducing assortments to the most popular selections in certain product categories 

given these ongoing demands and the complexity of the current environment we have focused on taking care of our associates by investing in additional pay and benefits including expanded paid time off for all hourly associates to use at their discretion and the implementation of a temporary weekly bonus program to continue to support our associates we have transitioned away from these temporary programs and have implemented permanent compensation enhancements for frontline hourly associates beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 totaling approximately 1 billion of expected incremental expense on an annualized basis collectively the enhanced pay and benefits implemented in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional expense of approximately 20 billion in fiscal 2020 

although we cannot estimate the future impact of covid19 or the recovery from the pandemic we believe our existing liquidity will be sufficient to continue to run our business effectively we also believe that the investments we have made in recent years in our stores interconnected and digital assets associates supply chain and merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs and behaviors and the fluid circumstances created by the pandemic we continue to actively monitor our business and operations and may take further actions as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates customers suppliers vendors and shareholders

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

sales we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales 

net sales  net sales for fiscal 2020 increased 219 billion or 199 to 1321 billion the increase in net sales for fiscal 2020 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable customer transactions and comparable average ticket online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 144 of net sales and grew by approximately 86 during fiscal 2020 the increase in online sales in fiscal 2020 was driven in large part by the impact of covid19 with customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms for their shopping needs a stronger us dollar negatively impacted sales growth by 381 million in fiscal 2020 

comparable sales  comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes sales at all locations physical and online open greater than 52 weeks including remodels and relocations and excludes closed stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 52 nd week of operation acquisitions are included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap 

total comparable sales increased 197 in fiscal 2020 reflecting a 105 increase in comparable average ticket and an 86 increase in comparable customer transactions the increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including increased consumer demand across our core categories and the execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds the increase in comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions was primarily driven by an increase in the number of products sold per transaction and stronger instore and online customer engagement as well as commodity price inflation primarily from lumber during fiscal 2020 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted doubledigit positive comparable sales while plumbing kitchen and bath and flooring posted high singledigit positive comparable sales when compared to last year 

gross profit gross profit increased 73 billion or 194 to 449 billion in fiscal 2020 gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 340 in fiscal 2020 compared to 341 in fiscal 2019 reflecting a change in product mix higher shrink and increased supply chain expense partially offset by the benefit from lower promotional activity in fiscal 2020 as we cancelled or modified certain annual merchandising events in response to covid19 

operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sga and depreciation and amortization 

selling general  administrative  sga increased 47 billion or 238 to 244 billion in fiscal 2020 as a percent of net sales sga was 185 for fiscal 2020 compared to 179 for fiscal 2019 the increase in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by an additional 20 billion of expense related to expanded associate pay and benefits an additional 238 million of operational expense related to covid19 and additional expense related to our store success sharing program and store and fieldbased management bonuses partially offset by leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment sga in fiscal 2020 also includes transactionrelated expenses of 110 million associated with the acquisition of hd supply 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased 139 million or 70 to 21 billion in fiscal 2020 as a percent of net sales depreciation and amortization was 16 for fiscal 2020 compared to 18 in fiscal 2019 the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales primarily reflected leverage resulting from positive comparable sales and timing of asset additions partially offset by strategic investments in the business 

interest and other net interest and other net was 13 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 11 billion for fiscal 2019 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and primarily reflected higher interest expense resulting from higher debt balances offset by leverage resulting from a positive comparable sales environment 

provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 242 for fiscal 2020 compared to 236 for fiscal 2019 the provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of certain discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2019

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were 1194 for fiscal 2020 compared to 1025 for fiscal 2019 the increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 reflected the impact of a positive comparable sales environment partially offset by the additional expenses incurred in response to covid19 as well as the incremental expense associated with our store success sharing program and store and fieldbased management bonuses

return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base we define roic as nopat a nongaap financial measure for the most recent twelvemonth period divided by average debt and equity we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending longterm debt including current installments and equity for the most recent twelvemonth period 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap measure follows

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at end of year 

at january 31 2021 we had 79 billion in cash and cash equivalents of which 13 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our current cash position access to the longterm debt capital markets cash flow generated from operations and funds available from our commercial paper programs should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs fund dividend payments fund any share repurchases and make any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years we also intend to maintain an elevated cash position during fiscal 2021 to further enhance our strong liquidity position in addition we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary 

during fiscal 2020 we chose to defer some of our instore strategic investments to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers in response to covid19 we expect to complete these investments in fiscal 2021 for

fiscal 2021 we will continue to follow our disciplined approach to capital allocation and we currently estimate capital expenditures of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis however we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business or in response to the economic environment as necessary or appropriate 

debt and derivative instruments 

in march 2020 we expanded our commercial paper programs from 30 billion to 60 billion to further enhance our liquidity position in response to the pandemic all of our shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were under these commercial paper programs in connection with these programs we had backup credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 65 billion which consisted of 1 a fiveyear 20 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in december 2023 2 a 364day 10 billion credit facility scheduled to expire december 2021 and 3 a 364day 35 billion credit facility that we entered into in march 2020 that was scheduled to expire in march 2021 in december 2020 we completed the renewal of our 364day 10 billion credit facility and extended our fiveyear 20 billion credit facility which extended the maturities from december 2020 to december 2021 and from december 2022 to december 2023 respectively on january 29 2021 we terminated the 364day 35 billion credit facility and at the same time reduced our commercial paper programs back to a maximum of 30 billion at january 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the two remaining credit facilities none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources at january 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs compared to 974 million outstanding at february 2 2020 we may enter into additional credit facilities or other debt financing 

we issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy in march 2020 and january 2021 we issued 50 billion and 30 billion of senior notes respectively we also repaid an aggregate of 29 billion of longterm debt during fiscal 2020 and in march 2021 we also fully repaid our 135 billion 200 senior notes that had a maturity date of april 2021

cash flows summary 

operating activities cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we make for products and services associate compensation operations and occupancy costs 

cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 52 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily driven by an increase in net earnings and changes in working capital working capital was impacted by timing of vendor payments along with higher merchandise inventories to continue to support increasing demand and replenish instock levels 

investing activities cash used in investing activities increased by 75 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to 78 billion of net consideration paid to acquire hd supply partially offset by the deferral of certain capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 due to covid19 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the hd supply acquisition 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected 79 billion of net proceeds from longterm debt offset by 65 billion of cash dividends paid 29 billion of repayments of longterm debt 974 million of net repayments of shortterm debt and 791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in march 2020

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

merchandise inventories 

we value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the firstin firstout method with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method under the retail inventory method inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories 

the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups markdowns and inventory losses or shrink as such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand customer preferences and buying trends age of the merchandise and weather conditions 

we calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a storespecific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results due to changes in operating conditions during fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we used the results from a sample of stores that were able to conduct physical inventories as a basis for estimating shrink for those stores at which physical inventory counts were temporarily suspended during the year we believe the sample of stores that were selected for inventory counts in the current year provides a reasonable basis for estimating shrink where a physical inventory count was not performed in fiscal 2020 historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

table of contents 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions of variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation 

if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows we then measure the asset’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations impairments of longlived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018 

uncertain tax positions 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in multiple jurisdictions across our global operations thus the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretations and application of complex tax law our provision for income taxes could be affected by many factors including changes in business operations changes in tax law outcomes of income tax audits changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies the impact of discrete tax items and the mix of earnings among our us and foreign operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with complexity and thus there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax positions requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we record the benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will be sustained 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available and requires a significant amount of management judgment for the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use an income approach significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates customer attrition rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill during the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our longterm debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio none of which are for trading or speculative purposes at january 31 2021 after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements floating rate debt principal was 47 billion or approximately 13 of our longterm debt portfolio and the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements totaled 101 million a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority has announced the phased cessation of publication of libor beginning after 2021 and continuing through 2023 when libor is discontinued we may need to change the terms of certain of our floating rate notes interest rate swap agreements and credit instruments which utilize libor as a 

table of contents 

benchmark in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established as a result we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard decisions have not been finalized regarding the replacement rates as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies we use derivative and nonderivative instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk none of which are for trading or speculative purposes our foreign currency related derivative and nonderivative instruments outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 were not material 

commodity price risk we experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products this price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition andor our results of operations in order to mitigate price volatility we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly however our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage these risks

intersecting our diy customers and our pros are our difm customers these customers are typically home owners who engage with pros to complete their project or installation instead of completing the project or installation themselves difm customers can purchase a variety of installation services in our stores online or in their homes through inhome consultations our installation programs include many categories such as flooring cabinets and cabinet makeovers countertops furnaces and central air systems and windows we believe that changing demographics are increasing the demand for our installation services particularly for our “baby boomer” customers who may have historically been diy customers but who are now looking for someone to complete a project for them we also believe our focus on serving the pros who perform services for our difm customers will help us drive higher product sales 

we help our customers finance their projects by offering plcc products through thirdparty credit providers our plcc program includes other benefits such as a 365day return policy and for our pros commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms in fiscal 2019  our customers opened approximately 48 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at the end of fiscal 2019 the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 167 million plcc sales accounted for approximately 23 of net sales in fiscal 2019  

we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates our customer experience begins with excellent customer service and our associates are key to delivering on that experience our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers and make working at the home depot a better experience 

to this end we have continued to focus on freight handling capabilities as part of a multiyear endtoend initiative to optimize how product flows from suppliers to our shelves among other benefits this initiative improves onshelf availability of products for customers while decreasing the amount of time a store associate spends locating product on the receiving dock or in overhead storage our overhead management application on our first phones helps associates locate product stored in overhead storage quickly and accurately saving time improving the customer 

experience and assisting with inventory management as part of our strategic investments we have rolled out our new order management system “order up” which consolidates certain of our existing legacy systems into a simple and intuitive user interface that requires minimal training and significantly decreases associate time required to create sell manage and edit orders we have also continued to leverage the enhanced labor model we launched in fiscal 2018 to better align associate activity with customer needs shifting from a model based on the number of transactions to one that correlates to the specific volume of activity within each store down to the department level this change allows us to better allocate our workforce to provide a bestinclass customer experience in addition in fiscal 2019 we expanded our inaisle mobile learning solution to all departments to further enhance our store associates’ learning and development and aid them in assisting customers this application which is on the first phone enables associates to integrate training into their everyday workstream as well as answer questions and assist customers in real time 

for our pro sales associates we have provided a number of tools aimed at helping them to better understand their top pro customers our myview system allows our pro sales associates to access customer data and information so they can proactively work with our pro customers and determine how we can better serve them 

at the end of fiscal 2019  we employed approximately 415700 associates of whom approximately 29500 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly basis our culture and values promote ongoing investment in our associates to attract reward and retain qualified associates we seek to maintain competitive wages in each market we serve offer comprehensive benefits geared towards helping associates through various life experiences and provide career growth and development opportunities that make working at the home depot a more rewarding experience we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service we measure associate satisfaction and engagement regularly through associate surveys and drive enhancements based on the feedback we receive we believe that our employee relations are very good 

interconnected experience connect stores to online and online to stores 

our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago as a result we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores online on the job site and in their homes 

we do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction rather we believe it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment and to postpurchase care and support from the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product knowhow we are investing in the infrastructure and processes needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today customers desire more personalized messaging so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and instore experiences to create a seamless series of contacts across channels doing this well provides tremendous value to the customer which in turn drives positive business results 

our stores remain the hub of our business and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout for several years our associates have used our first phones to help expedite the online order checkout process locate products in the aisles and online and check inventory on hand to improve the customer’s experience in our stores we have also empowered our customers with additional selfhelp tools including mobile appenabled store navigation our app provides storespecific maps which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices as part of our strategic investments we have made significant progress with the implementation of our wayfinding sign and store refresh package with over 1400 of our us stores completed by the end of fiscal 2019  this package includes new more intuitive signage better lighting and other store enhancements in fiscal 2019 we also continued the roll out of our redesigned front end area including reconfigured service desks optimized layouts in all checkout areas and expanded and enhanced selfcheckout options as well as the addition of selfservice lockers at the front entrance to offer convenient pick up of online orders we believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores 

the enhanced store experience is complemented by our continued investments in our website and mobile apps to drive a more interconnected digital customer experience enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices view our extended assortment and purchase products our investment in digital price labels for our appliance department has enabled us to incorporate ratings from the digital world into the store shopping experience enhancing the overall customer experience in the category 

we believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores we drive sales not just instore but also online our focus on improving search capabilities site functionality category presentation product content speed to checkout and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic better conversion and continued sales growth to create an enhanced customer experience we have been expanding our use of technology including advanced data science we have also continued to improve our ecommerce platform with a goal of driving a more personalized customer experience as discussed above 

connect products and services to customer needs 

we strive to be the number one retailer in product authority in home improvement by delivering product innovation assortment and value and by offering a range of home improvement services in fiscal 2019  we continued to invest in merchandising resets in our stores to refine assortments introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our diy and pro customers and improve visual merchandising to drive a better shopping experience at the same time we remain focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online to help our merchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and expanding desire for innovation localization and personalization we are investing in tools to better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with supplier partners as a result we have continued to focus on enhanced merchandising information technology tools to help us to build an interconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers’ personas shopping context and location ensure we have the best value in the market and optimize our product assortments

connect product to shelf site and customer 

we continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain we recognize that our customers’ expectations are changing rapidly and that our supply chain needs to be responsive to their expectations for how when and where they choose to receive our products and services as part of our one home depot initiative we are investing approximately 12 billion in the multiyear development of our one supply chain network which is designed to continue to improve productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement our efforts are focused on ensuring product availability and increasing the speed and reliability of delivery for our customers while managing our costs which results in higher returns for our shareholders 

we centrally forecast and replenish over 98 of our store products through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize a network of over 200 distribution centers to serve both our stores’ and customers’ needs this network includes multiple distribution center platforms in the us canada and mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products location transportation and delivery requirements these platforms primarily include rapid deployment centers stocking distribution centers bulk distribution centers and direct fulfillment centers as part of our investment in one supply chain we have invested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network to drive efficiency and faster movement of product 

we are also expanding our fulfillment network investing in approximately 150 new fulfillment facilities to drive speed and reliability of delivery for customers and help us meet our goal of reaching 90 of the us population with same or next day delivery for extended home improvement and mro product offerings including big and bulky goods these facilities include additional direct fulfillment centers which deliver product directly to customers and market delivery operations or mdos which function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of delivery with a focus on items like appliances we are also adding flatbed distribution centers which handle large items like lumber that are transported on flatbed trucks and market delivery centers which are focused on distribution of mro products and fastturning storebased products as of the end of fiscal 2019  we have opened at least one of each of these four major types of fulfillment facilities and will continue to build out our fulfillment network over the next few years 

in addition to our distribution centers we leverage our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient customer pickup return and delivery fulfillment locations our real estate footprint provides a distinct structural and competitive advantage for customers who shop online and wish to pickup or return merchandise at or have merchandise delivered from our us stores we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs boss bopis bodfs and boris which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage as of the end of fiscal 2019  approximately 50 of our us online orders were picked up in the store we also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve both efficiency and customer experience in our store delivery program 

a key component of our strategy is enabled through our technology portfolio which consists of a network of systems that help us centrally manage customer orders and optimize where when and how we fulfill them in order to maximize speed efficiency and the customer’s experience during fiscal 2019  we continued to improve our customer order management platform or com and our delivery management system which substantially improves our ability to sell and execute deliveries from our stores 

innovate our business model and value chain 

in the changing retail environment we must increase our investments to enhance the interconnected customer experience and position our company for the future our customers view us as one home depot and expect us to function in an interconnected seamless manner to fully realize the one home depot experience we will continue to connect the various aspects of our business and leverage our scale we will also invest in our physical locations our digital properties our associates products and innovation our pro and diy customers our services business and our supply chain underlying all of these investments is our continued investment in information technology which provides the backbone of the one home depot experience 

we continue to focus on driving productivity throughout the business this process includes lowering our costs and reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales creating what we refer to as a virtuous cycle we support a cycle of productivity through technology development improved processes and simplified systems driving productivity and speed across the value chain this virtuous cycle has allowed us to improve the customer experience increase our competitiveness in the market increase sales and deliver shareholder value 

our strategy to create the one home depot experience is driven by our desire to create value for all stakeholders including our customers our associates our supplier partners the communities we serve and our shareholders we are accelerating our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation our first use of cash has been and will continue to be investing in our business with use of the remainder guided by our shareholder return principles 



in fiscal 2019  we drove higher returns on invested capital which allowed us to return value to shareholders through 70 billion in share repurchases and 60 billion in cash dividends as discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive very fragmented and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster andor guaranteed delivery times as well as lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one supply chain 

sustainability efforts 

our environmental social and governance efforts are focused on taking care of our people and communities while operating sustainably the home depot is committed to sustainable business practices – from the products that we offer to our customers to the environmental impact of our operations to our sourcing activities to taking care of our associates to our involvement within the communities in which we do business we believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers shareholders associates and communities

commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible operations  the home depot also focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our operations including energy usage supply chain and packaging and store construction and maintenance in 2015 we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020 our first goal is to reduce our us stores’ energy use by 20 over 2010 levels and our second goal is to produce and procure on an annual basis 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources such as wind solar and fuel cell technology as of the end of fiscal 2019  we have 47 stores with solar rooftop power and 204 fuel cell systems that are either operational or in development which puts us on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020 in 2018 we set a sciencebased target goal in connection with our annual cdp reporting discussed below with commitments to a 21 annual reduction in carbon emissions our goal is to achieve a 40 reduction by 2030 and a 50 reduction by 2035 we are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our us facilities and continuing to invest in renewable and alternative energy additionally we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2019  157 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers our 2019 responsibility report provides more information on these and other sustainability efforts throughout our operations

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our industry is highly competitive very fragmented and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increasing the level of competition we face in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster andor guaranteed delivery times as well as lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one supply chain and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins 

we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense 

competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional programs our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions public health issues including pandemics and quarantines or natural disasters while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as our customers begin to expect a more personalized experience our ability to collect use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations our ability to collect and use that data however is subject to a number of external factors including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security in addition each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices read product reviews determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick timely and lowprice or free delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have our boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times options and costs customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory also called “shrink” higher rates of shrink which we have recently experienced can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience 

failure to improve and maintain our stores utilize our store space effectively and offer a safe shopping environment to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs to maintain appropriate inventory to provide quick and lowprice or free delivery alternatives to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the implementation of our store interconnected retail supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have been substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience including significant investments over several years to build one supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide highquality service to our customers simplify customer interactions provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience and create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement products failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations the one home depot initiative will require significant investment in our operations and systems as well as the development and execution 

of new processes systems and support the one supply chain initiative also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network if we are unable to effectively manage the volume nature and cost of these investments projects and changes our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected the cost and potential problems defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers employing new webbased tools and services implementing new technology implementing and restructuring support systems and processes identifying appropriate facility locations and addressing impacts on inventory levels could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term lead to product availability issues and impact profitability further accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts in addition our store and interconnected retail initiatives one supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to complete the initiatives or realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates unemployment levels and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage and healthcare benefits in addition to support our strategic initiatives including one supply chain and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates further changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data some of these systems are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers including certain cloud platform providers in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this operational and financial data for information such as sales customer data associate data demand forecasting merchandise ordering inventory replenishment supply chain management payment processing and order fulfillment for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems with which we interact are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches or data theft cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing spyware denial of service attacks and ransomware catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts may not be successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other thirdparty service providers these investments involve replacing existing systems with successor systems outsourcing certain technology to thirdparty service providers making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud or designing or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality these efforts can result in significant potential risks including failure of the systems to operate as designed potential loss or 

corruption of data changes in security processes cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges security failures reputational harm and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology systems we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms we use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and services and also as methods of providing inspiration as well as product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales regardless of whether they occur instore or online we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience we continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers disruptions delays failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers’ expectations could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions tariffs or importrelated taxes thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shortages of truck drivers shipping capacity constraints thirdparty contract disputes supply or shipping interruptions or costs military conflicts acts of terrorism public health issues including pandemics or quarantines such as the recent covid19 coronavirus outbreak or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage management and transmission of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties have in the past gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update our systems processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment as well as those of any companies we acquire there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs including costs to investigate and remediate as well as lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation 

in addition the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business the implementation of these requirements has 

also become more complex maintaining our compliance with those requirements including the california consumer privacy act ccpa may require significant effort and cost require changes to our business practices and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a personalized customer experience in addition failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines sanctions governmental investigations lawsuits or reputational damage 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards paypal our plccs an installment loan program trade credit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult costly or uncertain for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our payments and payment processing systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

uncertainty regarding the housing market economic conditions political climate public health issues and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services causing them to delay purchasing decisions or impacting their ability to pay for products and services other factors beyond our control – including unemployment and foreclosure rates inventory loss due to theft interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health issues including pandemics and quarantines and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

for example the recent pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus covid19 has led to work and travel restrictions within to and out of a number of countries and supply chain disruptions and delays these restrictions and delays which may expand depending on the progression of the pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact suppliers and manufacturers of certain of our products this may make it difficult for our suppliers to source and manufacture products in and to export our products from affected areas as a result we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products which could negatively affect our business and financial results even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products they may cost more which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition at this time there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of covid19 on our business and the costs that we may incur as a result infections have become more widespread which may worsen the supply shortage or restrict thirdparty manufacturing or other operations in response to the covid19 pandemic we have canceled or shifted to virtual experiences for certain supplier and associate events and have shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual and we may deem it appropriate or advisable to take further similar actions in the future we have shortened our customerfacing hours in all of our stores and temporarily closed our stores in puerto rico and we may need to restrict access to or close certain of or face labor shortages in other stores or facilities which could negatively impact productivity sales or operating expenses we are taking steps in our stores to manage foot traffic to better protect our customers and associates we have also expanded our paid time off policy to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates 

may be facing as a result of covid19 and we may face additional health insurance and laborrelated costs the pandemic may also reduce foot traffic in our stores or temporarily reduce demand for our products or services in certain jurisdictions we have had to cease sales of or delay commencement of certain services deemed “nonlifesustaining” and other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements further customers’ financial condition may be adversely impacted as a result of the impacts of covid19 and efforts taken to prevent its spread which could result in reduced demand for our products and services in addition our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if the impacts of the pandemic create disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt any of these occurrences may have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters as well as other catastrophic events could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also temporarily or on a longterm basis disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores unseasonable unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability military conflict acts of terrorism or violence public health issues including pandemics and quarantines the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control if we are unable to access products to meet our customers’ demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our image with customers expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales and results of operations 

product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including healthrelated concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even with adequate insurance and indemnification our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services including both national brand names and our proprietary products could suffer damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty in addition we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency sources of supply and child and forced labor we have a responsible sourcing audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks including regulatory product liability supplier relations and reputational risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings in addition to other productrelated risks discussed herein we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of work performed by our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers however if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines lawsuits and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements as well as for property damage or personal injury in addition we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses which could adversely affect our business 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty for each of our acquisitions we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data privacy and cybersecurity the sale and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics international trade supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property energy costs and consumption or environmental matters including with respect to our installation services business could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations 

in fiscal 2017 congress enacted the tax act which significantly changed how the us taxes corporations during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 additional guidance related to the tax act was issued by the us department of the treasury and the irs the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us department of the treasury the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations further in addition to uncertainties that continue to exist in terms of how us states will react to the tax act recently enacted changes in foreign countries within which we operate could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints as well as political social and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences international trade disputes trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes and controls greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on access to ports risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers for example trade tensions between the us and china have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced directly or indirectly outside of the us major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of demand for and profitability of retail product sales in our us locations other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations tariffs and trade restrictions and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured for a number of different risk categories such as general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical automobile claims and network security and privacy liability with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the 

occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

we are involved in a number of legal regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

executive summary 

highlights of our annual financial performance follow 

————— 

note fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 include 52 weeks fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks 

we reported net sales of 1102 billion in fiscal 2019  net earnings were 112 billion  or 1025 per diluted share we opened one net new store in mexico and three net new stores in the us during fiscal 2019  for a total store count of 2291 at february 2 2020  at the end of fiscal 2019  a total of 307 of our stores or 134  were located in canada and mexico total sales per retail square foot were 45482 in fiscal 2019  and our inventory turnover ratio was 49 times at the end of fiscal 2019  

we generated 137 billion of cash flow from operations during fiscal 2019 and issued 34 billion of longterm debt net of discounts and premiums these funds together with cash on hand were used to pay 60 billion of dividends fund cash payments of 70 billion for share repurchases repay 365 million of net shortterm borrowings fund 27 billion in capital expenditures and repay 10 billion of senior notes that matured in june 2019 

during fiscal 2019  we repurchased 70 billion of our common stock through open market transactions and an asr agreement in february 2020 we announced a 10 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 150 per share 

our roic was 454 for fiscal 2019  see the “ nongaap financial measures ” section below for our definition and calculation of roic as well as a reconciliation of nopat a nongaap financial measure to net earnings the most comparable gaap financial measure 

the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 which was declared a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 has led to adverse impacts on the us and global economies and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to our supply chain operations and customer demand the pandemic has impacted and could further impact our operations and the operations of our suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines facility closures and travel and logistics restrictions as a result of covid19 we have reduced store operating hours expanded our paid time off policy for associates and shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual and we may face additional laborrelated costs we are also taking steps in our stores to manage foot traffic to better protect our customers and associates in addition in certain jurisdictions we have had to cease sales of or delay commencement of work on certain services deemed “nonlifesustaining” 

we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates customers suppliers vendors and shareholders while the disruption is currently expected to be temporary there is 

uncertainty regarding its duration therefore while we expect the pandemic to impact our business results of operations financial position and liquidity we cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time 

results of operations and nongaap measures 

the tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following table displays the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts

note fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 include 52 weeks fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

sales we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales 

net sales  fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2018  net sales for fiscal 2019 increased 20 billion  or 19  to 1102 billion  the increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket growth and comparable customer transactions offset by 17 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2018 online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 93 of net sales and grew 194 during fiscal 2019  

comparable sales  comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes sales at all locations physical and online open greater than 52 weeks including remodels and relocations and excludes closed stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 52 nd week of operation acquisitions digital or otherwise are included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks our comparable sales results for fiscal 2019 compare the 52week period reported for fiscal 2019 to weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2018 comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap 

total comparable sales increased   35 in fiscal 2019  the increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including traffic growth across a number of our core categories and the execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales in fiscal 2019 except for lumber  which was negative primarily due to commodity price deflation for fiscal 2019  comparable sales for our appliances indoor garden décorstorage tools hardware and outdoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average our comparable average ticket increased   25 in fiscal 2019 while comparable customer transactions increased   11 during fiscal 2019  the increase in comparable average ticket was due in large part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain categories such as appliances and vinyl plank flooring 

gross profit gross profit increased   412 million  or 11  to 376 billion in fiscal 2019  gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 341 in fiscal 2019 compared to 343 in fiscal 2018  the decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher shrink and changes in product mix 

operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sga depreciation and amortization and impairment loss 

selling general  administrative  sga increased   227 million  or 12  to 197 billion in fiscal 2019  as a percent of net sales sga was 179 for fiscal 2019 compared to 180 for fiscal 2018  the decrease in sga as 

a percent of net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by expense leverage resulting from positive comparable sales and continued expense control partially offset by expenses related to strategic investments in the business 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased 119 million  or 64  in fiscal 2019  as a percent of net sales depreciation and amortization was 18 for fiscal 2019 compared to 17 in fiscal 2018  the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflects incremental depreciation stemming from investments in the business partially offset by leverage resulting from positive comparable sales and timing of asset additions the additional week in fiscal 2018 did not result in incremental expense because we recognize depreciation and amortization expense on a monthly basis 

impairment loss  there were no material impairment losses recognized in fiscal 2019  we recognized a 247 million impairment loss in fiscal 2018 related to certain trade names associated with interline see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other net interest and other net was 11 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to 974 million for fiscal 2018  interest and other net as a percent of net sales increased to 10 in fiscal 2019 from 09 in fiscal 2018  primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher debt balances in fiscal 2019  

provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 236 for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 reflects a benefit from stockbased compensation and other discrete tax items the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the enactment of the tax act see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were 1025 for fiscal 2019 compared to 973 for fiscal 2018  diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 reflected a taxrelated benefit of 017 per share resulting from stockbased compensation and other discrete tax items 

diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 reflected a benefit of 148 per share resulting from the enactment of the tax act a benefit of 021 per share for the 53 rd week and a decrease of 016 per share due to the impairment loss related to certain trade names associated with interline 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

for a comparison of our results of operations for fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017  see “ part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 3 2019 filed with the sec on march 28 2019 

nongaap financial measures 

to provide clarity about our operating performance we supplement our reporting with certain nongaap financial measures however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures nongaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies 

return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base we define roic as nopat a nongaap financial measure for the most recent twelvemonth period divided by average debt and equity we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending longterm debt including current installments and equity for the most recent twelvemonth period 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap measure follows

at february 2 2020  we had 21 billion in cash and cash equivalents of which 18 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our current cash position cash flow generated from operations funds available from our commercial paper programs and access to the longterm debt capital markets should be sufficient for our operating requirements and to enable us to fund our capital expenditures dividend payments and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing we expect capital expenditures of approximately 28 billion in fiscal 2020 given the current uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic we may adjust our capital expenditures as necessary or appropriate to support the operations of the business 

debt and derivatives 

at february 2 2020 we had commercial paper programs with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 30 billion  all of our shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were under these commercial paper programs in connection with these programs we have backup credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 30 billion  which consist of a fiveyear 20 billion credit facility which expires in december 2022 and a 364day 

10 billion credit facility in december 2019 we completed the renewal of our 364day 10 billion credit facility extending the maturity from december 2019 to december 2020 at february 2 2020  we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources at february 2 2020  there were 974 million of borrowings outstanding under these commercial paper programs compared to 13 billion at february 3 2019  

in march 2020 we expanded our commercial paper programs from 30 billion to 60 billion we also entered into an additional 364day 35 billion credit facility in march 2020 which together with the two credit facilities mentioned above backs up our expanded commercial paper programs we may enter into additional credit facilities or other debt financing 

we also issue senior notes from time to time and use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain longterm debt see note 4 and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements 

leases 

we use operating and finance leases to fund a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases 

share repurchases 

in february 2019 our board of directors authorized a new 150 billion share repurchase program of which approximately 83 billion remained at the end of fiscal 2019  during fiscal 2019  we had cash payments of 70 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases and an asr agreement see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchases in march 2020 we suspended our share repurchases until such time as we deem appropriate 

cash flows summary 

operating activities cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation operations and occupancy costs 

cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was 137 billion driven primarily by net earnings of 112 billion and noncash adjustments to net earnings of 27 billion consisting of depreciation and amortization stock 

based compensation expense and changes in deferred income taxes offset by working capital outflows driven primarily by timing of inventory purchases and collection of receivables 

net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was 130 billion driven primarily by net earnings of 111 billion and noncash adjustments to net earnings of 27 billion consisting of depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation impairment loss and changes in deferred income taxes partially offset by net cash outflows associated with changes in working capital driven primarily by timing of inventory purchases

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations at february 2 2020 were as follows 



————— 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the 

representation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

merchandise inventories 

we value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the firstin firstout method with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method under the retail inventory method inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories 

the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups markdowns and inventory losses or shrink as such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand customer preferences and buying trends age of the merchandise and weather conditions 

we calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses determined as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses which occur between physical inventory counts the estimate for shrink in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a storespecific basis based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions of variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation 

if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows we then measure the asset’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers’ compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we have no stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and coop advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on 

guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain coop advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold certain other coop advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

uncertain tax positions 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in multiple jurisdictions across our global operations thus the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretations and application of complex tax law our provision for income taxes could be affected by many factors including changes in business operations changes in tax law outcomes of income tax audits changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies the impact of discrete tax items and the mix of earnings among our us and foreign operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with complexity and thus there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax positions requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we record the benefits of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will be sustained

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our longterm debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at february 2 2020  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements floating rate debt principal was 29 billion  or approximately 10 of our longterm debt portfolio a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 when libor is discontinued we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes interest rate swap agreements and credit instruments which utilize libor as a benchmark in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established as a result we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard decisions have not been finalized regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately 89 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2019  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

commodity price risk we experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products this price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition andor our results of operations in order to mitigate price volatility we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly however our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage these risks

our business 

our strategy 

our two primary objectives are growing market share with our customers and delivering shareholder value we have historically been guided by three principles to drive growth delivering an exceptional customer experience leading in product authority and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation these principles reflect how we fundamentally run our business as the retail landscape continues to evolve we must become more agile in responding to the changing competitive environment and customer preferences our customers expect to be able to buy how when and where they want we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels featuring curated and innovative product choices personalized for the individual shopper’s need which are then delivered in a fast and costefficient manner is a key enabler for our future success this is what we call the one home depot experience in late 2017 we announced that we would be investing approximately 11 billion over a multiyear period in our stores associates digital experience and supply chain to drive value for our customers our associates our suppliers and our shareholders to accomplish this we are executing against five key strategies designed to drive growth in our business 

 taken together these strategies are helping us to create the one home depot experience that our customers demand below are some of the ways we have been investing in that experience during fiscal 2018  

connect associates to customer needs 

we serve two primary customer groups and have different approaches to meeting their needs 



grow their business we believe that investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our pro customers are yielding increased engagement and will continue to translate into incremental spend as part of our continued commitment to invest in pro customer relationships and the significant market opportunity these customers represent we have created an enhanced pro customer experience both online and instore 

at the end of 2018 we announced a new consolidated gotomarket strategy for all of our pro initiatives including our mro business formerly known as interline under “the home depot pro” banner with the home depot pro pros have access to a comprehensive offering that includes a combination of our vast store network a bestinclass dedicated sales force quality and affordable products from trusted brands an extensive delivery network and online business solutions we provide specialized programs such as an expanded mro assortment inventory management solutions custom product offerings instore pro desk and pro services and enhanced credit programs we also provide and are continuously working to improve our delivery options for pros including pick up instore direct to job site delivery or shipto home to allow us to deliver when where and how our customers demand online our pros receive a personalized experience based on their business their needs their industry and their purchasing behavior 

pro customers are not onesizefitsall and the home depot pro offers the level of valueadded services that our diverse pro customers demand our pro loyalty program pro xtra provides pros with benefits related to useful business services exclusive product offers and a purchase monitoring tool to enable receipt lookup and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment we will continue to invest in the pro customer experience to provide the services solutions support and online tools they need to grow their businesses 

intersecting our diy customers and our pros are our difm customers these customers are typically home owners who engage with pros to complete their project or installation instead of completing the project or installation themselves difm customers can purchase a variety of installation services in our stores online or in their homes through inhome consultations our installation programs include many categories such as flooring cabinets and cabinet makeovers countertops furnaces and central air systems and windows we believe that changing demographics are increasing the demand for our installation services particularly for our baby boomer customers who may have historically been diy customers but who are now looking for someone to complete a project for them we also believe our focus on serving the pros who perform services for our difm customers will help us drive higher product sales 

we help our customers finance their projects by offering plcc products through thirdparty credit providers our plcc program includes other benefits such as a 365day return policy and for our pros commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms in fiscal 2018  our customers opened approximately 48 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at the end of fiscal 2018  the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 16 million plcc sales accounted for approximately 23 of net sales in fiscal 2018  

we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates our customer experience begins with excellent customer service and our associates are key to delivering on that experience our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers to this end in fiscal 2018  we continued to invest in freight handling capabilities as part of an endtoend initiative to optimize how product flows from suppliers to our shelves among other benefits this initiative improves our onshelf availability while decreasing the amount of time a store associate spends locating product on the receiving dock or in overhead storage we deployed our new overhead management application on our first phones our webenabled handheld devices in fiscal 2018  which helps associates locate product stored in overhead storage quickly and accurately saving time improving the customer experience and assisting with inventory management in addition we launched a new order management system called “order up” to consolidate certain of our existing legacy systems into a simple and intuitive user interface that requires minimal training and significantly decreases associate time required to create sell manage and edit orders these efforts allow our associates to devote more time to the customer and make working at the home depot a better experience 

during fiscal 2018  we also enhanced our labor model to better align associate activity with customer needs shifting from a model based on the number of transactions to one that correlates to the specific volume of activity within each store down to the department level this change which is now live in all stores allows us to better allocate our workforce to provide a bestinclass customer experience 

at the end of fiscal 2018  we employed approximately 413000 associates of whom approximately 29000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract reward and retain qualified 

personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service in fiscal 2018  as part of our strategic investments we made a number of investments in our associates including changes to our benefits programs to eliminate a waiting period for new hires and an enhanced paid maternity and parental leave program we measure associate satisfaction regularly and we believe that our employee relations are very good 

interconnected experience stores to online and online to stores 

our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago as a result we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores online on the job site and in their homes 

we do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction rather we believe it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment and to postpurchase care and support from the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product knowhow we are investing in the infrastructure and processes needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today this means adjusting messages so that they are personalized to the customer such as showing product that completes their project based upon what was recently purchased or highlighting products and services that are most relevant based upon changing weather conditions customers desire more personalized messaging so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and instore experiences to create a seamless series of contacts across all channels doing this well provides tremendous value to the customer which in turn drives business results 

our stores are the hub of our business and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout for several years our associates have used our first phones to help expedite the online order checkout process locate products in the aisles and online and check inventory on hand in fiscal 2018  we empowered our customers with additional selfhelp tools as part of our strategic investments we have made progress with the implementation of our wayfinding sign and store refresh package with almost 1300 of our us stores completed by the end of fiscal 2018  ahead of our original plan this package includes new more intuitive signage better lighting and basic store enhancements we also continued the roll out of our redesigned front end area including optimized layouts in all checkout areas and expanded and enhanced selfcheckout options as well as the addition of selfservice lockers at the front entrance to offer convenient pick up of online orders

connect product to shelf site and customer 

we continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain these efforts are designed to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs which results in higher returns for our shareholders we recognize that our customers’ expectations are changing rapidly and that our supply chain needs to be responsive to their expectations for how when and where they choose to receive our products and services we will continue to improve productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement we refer to this process which encompasses a multiyear effort as one home depot supply chain during fiscal 2018  we continued to build the foundation to meet this goal 

we centrally forecast and replenish over 98 of our store products through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize a network of over 200 distribution centers to serve both our stores and customers needs this network includes multiple distribution center platforms in the us canada and mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products location transportation and delivery requirements these platforms primarily include rapid deployment centers stocking distribution centers bulk distribution centers and direct fulfillment centers as part of our investment in one home depot supply chain we will add a number of different fulfillment facilities designed to help us meet our goal of reaching 90 of the us population with same or next day delivery for an extended home improvement product offering including big and bulky goods these facilities include more direct fulfillment centers and market delivery operations or mdos which function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of delivery in fiscal 2018  we began piloting these facilities 

in addition to our distribution centers we leverage our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient customer pickup return and delivery fulfillment locations for customers who shop online and wish to pickup or return merchandise at or have merchandise delivered from our us stores we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs boss bopis bodfs and boris which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage for example as of the end of fiscal 2018  almost 50 of our us online orders were picked up in the store we also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve both the efficiency and customer experience in our store delivery program for example as of the end of fiscal 2018  we have rolled out van and car delivery to over 70 and 40 of the us population respectively which provides our customers with a fast and affordable service for smaller deliveries   

a key component of our strategy is enabled through our technology portfolio which consists of a network of systems that help us centrally manage customer orders and optimize where when and how we fulfill them in order to maximize speed efficiency and the customer’s experience during fiscal 2018  we continued to improve our customer order management platform or com and our delivery management system which substantially improves our ability to sell and execute deliveries from our stores 

innovate our business model and value chain 

in the changing retail environment we must increase our investments to enhance the interconnected customer experience and position our company for the future our customers view us as one home depot and expect us to function in an interconnected seamless manner to fully realize the one home depot experience we will continue to connect the various aspects of our business and leverage our scale we will also invest in our physical locations our digital properties our associates products and innovation our pro and diy customers our services business and our supply chain underlying all of these investments is our continued investment in information technology which provides the backbone of the one home depot experience 

we continue to focus on driving productivity throughout the business this process includes lowering our costs and reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales creating what we refer to as a virtuous cycle through technology development we drive productivity and speed by focusing on the elimination of waste across the value chain improved processes and simplified systems we support a cycle of productivity this virtuous cycle has allowed us to improve the customer experience increase our competitiveness in the market increase sales and deliver on shareholder value 

our strategy to create the one home depot experience is driven by our desire to create value for all stakeholders including our customers our associates our supplier partners the communities we serve and our shareholders we are accelerating our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation our first use of cash has been and will continue to be investing in our business with use of the remainder guided by our shareholder return principles 

 in fiscal 2018  we drove higher returns on invested capital which allowed us to return value to shareholders through 100 billion  in share repurchases and 47 billion  in cash dividends as discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise our customers routinely use a variety of electronic devices and platforms to shop online read product reviews and compare prices products and delivery options regardless of where or how they shop further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain 

sustainability efforts 

the home depot is committed to sustainable business practices – from the products that we offer to our customers to the environmental impact of our operations to our sourcing activities to our involvement within the communities in which we do business we believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers shareholders and communities

commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible operations  the home depot also focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our operations including energy usage supply chain and packaging and store construction and maintenance in 2015 we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020 our first goal is to reduce our us stores’ energy use by 20 over 2010 levels and our second goal is to produce and procure on an annual basis 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources such as wind solar and fuel cell technology as of the end of fiscal 2018  we have 45 stores with solar rooftop power and over 202 fuel cell systems that are either operational or in development which puts us on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020 in 2018  we set a science based target goal in connection with our annual cdp reporting discussed below with commitments to a 21 annual reduction in carbon emissions our goal is to achieve a 399 reduction by 2030 and a 504 reduction by 2035 we are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our us facilities and continuing to invest in renewable and alternative energy additionally we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2018  148 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers our 2018  responsibility report which uses the global reporting initiative or gri framework for sustainability reporting provides more information on sustainability efforts in other aspects of our operations

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our industry is highly competitive and evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increasing the level of competition we face in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability product assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise our customers routinely use a variety of electronic devices and platforms to shop online read product reviews and compare prices products and delivery options regardless of where or how they shop further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins 

we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional programs our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand in addition each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of – or within – a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding as noted above customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and platforms to rapidly compare products and prices determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick timely and lowprice or free delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have our boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times options and costs customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory also called shrink 

failure to improve and maintain our stores utilize our store space effectively and offer a safe shopping environment to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs and maintain appropriate inventory to provide quick and lowprice or free delivery alternatives to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the implementation of our store interconnected retail supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we are substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience including significant investments over the next several years to build the one home depot supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide highquality service to our customers simplify customer interactions provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience and create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement products failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations the one home depot initiative will require significant investment in our operations and systems as well as the development and execution of new processes systems and support if we are unable to effectively manage the volume and nature of these changes our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected the cost and potential problems defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers employing new webbased tools and services implementing new technology implementing and restructuring support systems and processes and addressing impacts on inventory levels could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term lead to product availability issues and impact profitability further accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts in addition our store and interconnected retail initiatives one home depot supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage and healthcare benefits in addition to support our strategic initiatives including one home depot supply chain and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability 

to retain and attract associates further changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this operational and financial data for information such as sales customer data merchandise ordering inventory replenishment and order fulfillment for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems with which we interact are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing and denial of service attacks and ransomware catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts may not be successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology systems we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and platforms we use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration as well as product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales regardless of whether they occur instore or online we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade policy changes or restrictions tariffs or importrelated taxes thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints thirdparty contract disputes supply or shipping interruptions or costs military conflicts acts of terrorism or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage management and transmission of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data 

protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties have in the past gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update our systems processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment as well as those of any companies we acquire there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs including costs to investigate and remediate as well as lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation in addition the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business and the implementation of these requirements has become more complex maintaining our compliance with those requirements may require significant effort and cost and failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines sanctions governmental investigations or lawsuits 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards paypal our plccs an installment loan program trade credit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

uncertainty regarding the housing market economic conditions political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services causing them to delay purchasing decisions or impacting their ability to pay for products and services other factors beyond our control – including unemployment and foreclosure rates inventory loss due to theft interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters acts of terrorism and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also temporarily or on a longterm basis disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores unseasonable unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability military conflict acts of terrorism the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our image with customers expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales and results of operations 

product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including healthrelated concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even with adequate insurance and indemnification our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services including both national brand names and our proprietary products could suffer damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty in addition we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency sources of supply and child and forced labor we have a responsible sourcing audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks including regulatory product liability supplier relations and reputational risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings in addition to other productrelated risks discussed herein we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of work performed by our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers however if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines lawsuits and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements as well as for property damage or personal injury in addition we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses which could adversely affect our business 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty for each of our acquisitions we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data protection and cybersecurity the sale and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics international trade supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property energy costs and consumption or environmental matters including with respect to our installation services business could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations 

in fiscal 2017 congress enacted the tax act which significantly changes how the us taxes corporations during fiscal 2018 additional guidance related to the tax act was issued by the us department of the treasury and the irs the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us 

department of the treasury the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations further uncertainties also exist in terms of how us states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these us federal income tax changes which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes and controls greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers for example there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the us and china as both countries have indicated their intentions to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories as well as concerns related to the renegotiation of certain other trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced directly or indirectly outside of the us major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of demand for and profitability of retail product sales in our us locations other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations tariffs and trade restrictions and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured for a number of different risk categories such as general liability including product liability workers compensation employee group medical automobile claims and network security and privacy liability with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

we are involved in a number of legal regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary 

course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

note fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 include 52 weeks 

we reported net sales of 1082 billion  in fiscal 2018  net earnings were 111 billion  or 973  per diluted share the 53 rd  week in fiscal 2018 added 17 billion of net sales and 241 million of net earnings and increased diluted earnings per share by 021 our effective tax rate was 236  for fiscal 2018 and lower than fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 primarily due to enactment of the tax act 

we opened two  new stores in mexico and one  new store in the us during fiscal 2018  for a total store count of 2287  at february 3 2019  at the end of fiscal 2018  a total of 306  of our stores or 134  were located in canada and mexico total sales per square foot were 44686  in fiscal 2018  and our inventory turnover ratio was 51  times at the end of fiscal 2018

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017 

sales  we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales 

net sales  fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2017 net sales for fiscal 2018   increased   73 billion  or 72  to 1082 billion  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2018  primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by average ticket growth and increased customer transactions as well as 17 billion  of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2018 online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 79  of net sales and grew 262  during fiscal 2018  the adoption of asu no 201409 benefited net sales by 216 million in fiscal 2018 while the effect of foreign currency had a negligible impact on net sales see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements for more information on asu no 201409 and the implementation of this new standard for revenue recognition 

comparable sales  comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes sales at all locations physical and online open greater than 52 weeks including remodels and relocations and excluding closed stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 365 th  day of operation acquisitions digital or otherwise are included in comparable sales after we own them for more than 52 weeks with the exception of interline which is excluded from comparable sales for periods prior to fiscal 2018 net sales for the 53 rd  week in a fiscal year are not included in the comparable sales calculation for that fiscal year for example our comparable sales results for fiscal 2018 compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2018 to the 52week period reported for fiscal 2017 comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap 

total comparable sales increased   52 in fiscal 2018  the increase  in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including the execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales in fiscal 2018  except for lighting  which was negative primarily due to led price deflation for fiscal 2018  comparable sales for our appliances tools electrical décor plumbing lumber and indoor garden  merchandising departments were above the company average our comparable average ticket increased 42 in fiscal 2018  while comparable customer transactions increased 10  during fiscal 2018  the increase in comparable average ticket was due in large part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain categories such as appliances and vinyl plank flooring 

gross profit   gross profit increased   28 billion  or 82  to 372 billion  in fiscal 2018  gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 343  in fiscal 2018 compared to 340  in fiscal 2017  the increase in gross profit margin for fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by a 598 million benefit from the adoption of asu no 201409 and a benefit from mix of products sold partially offset by higher transportation and fuel costs in our supply chain and shrink the additional week in fiscal 2018 contributed 615 million to gross profit 

operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sga depreciation and amortization and impairment loss 

selling general  administrative    sga increased   16 billion  or 92  to 195 billion in fiscal 2018  as a percent of net sales sga was 180  for fiscal 2018 compared to 177 for fiscal 2017  the increase in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2018 reflected an increase of 598 million from the adoption of asu no 201409 and 544 million of incremental investments made in the business partially offset by expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and continued expense control the additional week in fiscal 2018 contributed 301 million to sga 

depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization increased   59 million  or 33  in fiscal 2018  as a percent of net sales depreciation and amortization was 17 for fiscal 2018 compared to 18  in fiscal 2017  the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and the timing of asset additions partially offset by 136 million of incremental depreciation stemming from investments in the business the additional week in fiscal 2018 did not result in incremental expense because we recognize depreciation and amortization expense on a monthly basis 

impairment loss  we recognized a 247 million  impairment loss in fiscal 2018 related to certain trade names associated with interline   see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

interest and other net   interest and other net was 974 million for fiscal 2018 compared to 983 million for fiscal 2017  interest and other net as a percent of net sales decreased to 09 in fiscal 2018 from 10  in fiscal 2017  primarily reflecting sales leverage resulting from the positive sales environment decreased tax reserves 

due to certain positive audit settlements and higher interest income partially offset by higher interest expense on longterm debt balances in fiscal 2018  and a loss on the sale of a nonstrategic asset 

provision for income taxes   our combined effective income tax rate was 236 for fiscal 2018 compared to 370  for fiscal 2017  the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the enactment of the tax act and adjustments to the provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as certain positive audit settlements see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

diluted earnings per share   diluted earnings per share were 973 for fiscal 2018 compared to 729 for fiscal 2017  diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018   reflected a benefit of 148 per share resulting from the enactment of the tax act a benefit of 021 per share for the 53 rd  week and a decrease of 016 per share due to the impairment loss 

diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 009 per share as a result of the adoption of asu no 201609 which requires that we recognize tax benefits or deficiencies related to sharebased payment awards in the provision for income taxes diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 also reflected decreases of 011 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the tax act and 006 per share due to the onetime bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the tax act 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

sales   

net sales  net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 63 billion or 67 to 1009 billion the increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth hurricanerelated sales contributed approximately 662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017 

comparable sales  total comparable sales increased 68 in fiscal 2017 the increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including the execution of our strategy and broadbased growth across our stores and online online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 67 of net sales and grew 215 during fiscal 2017 all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales except for one which was flat in fiscal 2017 comparable sales for our lumber electrical tools appliances flooring building materials and indoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average during fiscal 2017 our comparable customer transactions increased 22 during fiscal 2017 further our comparable average ticket increased 45 in fiscal 2017 due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments such as appliances and flooring 

gross profit   gross profit increased 20 billion or 63 to 344 billion in fiscal 2017 gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 340 in fiscal 2017 compared to 342 in fiscal 2016 the modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 reflected the impact of lower margin hurricanerelated sales and higher shrink partially offset by benefits from our supply chain 

operating expenses 

selling general  administrative    sga increased 732 million or 43 to 179 billion in fiscal 2017 and included approximately 170 million of hurricanerelated expenses as a percent of net sales sga was 177 for fiscal 2017 compared to 181 for fiscal 2016 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment and continued expense control 

depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization increased 57 million or 32 in fiscal 2017 the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 18 in fiscal 2017 from 19 in fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive sales environment 

interest and other net   interest and other net was 983 million for fiscal 2017 compared to 936 million for fiscal 2016 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and reflected additional interest expense in fiscal 2017 resulting from higher longterm debt balances in fiscal 2017 offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

provision for income taxes   our combined effective income tax rate was 370 for fiscal 2017 compared to 363 for fiscal 2016 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 reflected a net 127 million charge resulting from 

the enactment of the tax act the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 also reflected a 106 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for sharebased payment awards as a result of our adoption of asu no 201609 

diluted earnings per share   diluted earnings per share were 729 for fiscal 2017 compared to 645 for fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 009 per share as a result of the adoption of asu no 201609 as well as decreases of 011 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the tax act and 006 per share due to the onetime bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the tax act 

nongaap financial measures 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance we supplement our reporting with certain nongaap financial measures however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures nongaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies 

return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base we define roic as nopat a nongaap financial measure for the most recent twelvemonth period divided by average debt and equity we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending longterm debt including current installments and equity for the most recent twelvemonth period 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap measure follows

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at end of year 

at february 3 2019  we had 18 billion  in cash and cash equivalents of which 14 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our current cash position access to the longterm debt capital markets funds available from our commercial paper programs and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

as we accelerate our investments in the business we expect capital expenditures of approximately 27 billion in fiscal 2019 

debt and derivatives 

we have commercial paper programs with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 30 billion  all of our shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  were under these commercial paper programs in connection with these 

programs we have backup credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 30 billion  which consist of a fiveyear 20 billion credit facility and a 364day 10 billion credit facility in december 2018 we completed the renewal of our 364day 10 billion credit facility extending the maturity from december 2018 to december 2019 in december 2017 we replaced our fiveyear 20 billion  credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december 2019  with a new substantially identical fiveyear 20 billion  credit facility that expires in december 2022  at february 3 2019  we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources at february 3 2019  there were 13 billion  of borrowings outstanding under these commercial paper programs compared to 16 billion  at january 28 2018  

we also issue senior notes from time to time and use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain longterm debt see note 4  and note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements

cash flows summary

net cash provided by operating activities increased   10 billion  in fiscal 2018  and increased   22 billion  in fiscal 2017  the increase in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected an increase in net earnings partially offset by net cash outflows associated with changes in working capital the increase in net earnings during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 resulting from the enactment of the tax act and higher comparable 

sales the increase in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected an increase in net earnings and net cash inflows associated with changes in working capital the increase in earnings in fiscal 2017 resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

merchandise inventories 

we value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the firstin firstout method with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method under the retail inventory method 

inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market 

as the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups markdowns and inventory losses or shrink there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation 

if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows we then measure the asset’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers’ compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we have no stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2016  

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed we estimate the liability for sales returns including the estimated gross profit impact based on our historical return levels and believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns in connection with the adoption of asu no 201409 we also recognize a return asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer measured at the former carrying amount of the goods less any expected recovery cost at each financial reporting date we assess our estimates of expected returns refund liabilities and return assets 

we defer revenue and the related gross profit for payments received from customers for which the customer has not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer this amount is recorded as deferred revenue we estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rates which we believe to be a reasonable reflection of future rates if these estimates significantly differ from actual amounts our net sales and gross profit could be impacted 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and coop advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain coop advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain coop advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk  we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our longterm debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at february 3 2019  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements floating rate debt principal was 21 billion  or approximately 8  of our longterm debt portfolio a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 if libor is discontinued we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes interest rate swap agreements and credit instruments which utilize libor as a benchmark in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established as a result we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk   we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately  88 billion  of our revenue for fiscal 2018  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

commodity price risk   we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

our business 

our strategy 

our two primary objectives are growing market share with our customers and delivering shareholder value we have historically been guided by three principles to drive growth delivering an exceptional customer experience leading in product authority and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation these principles reflect how we fundamentally run our business as the retail landscape continues to rapidly evolve we must become more agile in responding to the changing competitive landscape and customer preferences our customers expect to be able to buy how when and where they want we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels featuring curated and innovative product choices personalized for the individual shopper’s need which are then delivered in a fast and costefficient manner will be a key enabler for our future success this is our vision for one home depot we have been focused on providing this interconnected retail experience to drive value for our customers our associates our suppliers and our shareholders with that in mind we have refined our strategic principles into the following five key strategies designed to drive growth in our business 

 taken together these strategies will help us to create the one home depot experience that our customers demand below are some of the ways we have been investing in that experience during fiscal 2017 

connect associates to customer needs 

we serve two primary customer groups and have different approaches to meet their needs 



programs designated parking spaces close to store entrances and bulk pricing programs for both online and instore purchases in addition we maintain a loyalty program pro xtra that provides our pros with discounts on useful business services exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment 

we also serve pros in the mro market where our customers are primarily institutions such as educational and healthcare institutions hospitality businesses and national multifamily apartment complexes through our entry into this market with our acquisition of interline in fiscal 2015 we gained additional competencies relevant to our large pro customers including outside sales and account management expanded product assortment and last mile delivery capabilities during fiscal 2017 we continued our integration efforts rolling out pro mro in all us stores giving customers in our stores access to interlines assortment similarly we launched our pro purchase program which gives interline customers the ability to shop our stores using their house accounts 

our pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform our goal is to develop a comprehensive set of capabilities for our pros to provide solutions across every purchase opportunity such as supplying both recurring mro needs and renovation products and services to property managers or providing inventory management solutions for specialty tradesmen’s replenishment needs in fiscal 2017 we enhanced our service offering to our pros through our acquisition of compact power a national provider of equipment rental and maintenance services we believe that by bringing our best resources to bear for each individual customer we can provide a differentiated customer experience and enhanced value proposition for our pro customers 

intersecting our diy customers and our pros are our difm customers   these customers are typically home owners who purchase materials and hire pros to complete the project or installation our stores offer a variety of installation services available to difm customers who purchase products and installation of those products from us in our stores online or in their homes through inhome consultations our installation programs include many categories such as flooring cabinets countertops water heaters and sheds in addition we provide thirdparty professional installation in a number of categories sold through our inhome sales programs such as roofing siding windows cabinet refacing furnaces and central air systems we believe that changing demographics are increasing the demand for our installation services particularly for our baby boomer customers who may have historically been diy customers but who are now looking for someone to complete a project for them we also believe our focus on serving the pros who perform services for our difm customers will help us drive higher product sales 

we help our customers finance their projects by offering private label credit card or plcc products through thirdparty credit providers our private label credit program includes other benefits such as a 365day return policy and for our pros commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms in fiscal 2017 our customers opened approximately 44 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at the end of fiscal 2017 the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 15 million plcc sales accounted for approximately 23 of net sales in fiscal 2017 

we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates our customer experience begins with excellent customer service and our associates are key to delivering on that experience our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers in fiscal 2017 we continued to invest in freight handling capabilities as part of an endtoend initiative to optimize how product flows from suppliers to our shelves among other benefits this initiative improves our onshelf availability while decreasing the amount of time a store associate spends locating product on the receiving dock or in overhead storage in addition we are implementing a new order management system called “order up” to consolidate certain of our existing legacy systems into a simple and intuitive user interface these efforts will allow our associates to devote more time to the customer and make working at the home depot a better experience 

at the end of fiscal 2017 we employed approximately 413000 associates of whom approximately 28000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service in fiscal 2017 we announced a onetime bonus to our us hourly associates in light of the benefit we expect to receive from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 this bonus was in addition to our semiannual success sharing bonus 

program for our nonmanagement associates we measure associate satisfaction regularly and we believe that our employee relations are very good 

interconnected experience stores to online and online to stores 

our customers are shopping and interacting with us differently today than they did several years ago as a result we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across our stores online on the job site and in their homes 

our stores are the hub of our business and we are investing to improve the convenience and speed of the customer shopping experience in our stores for several years our associates have used first phones our webenabled handheld devices to help expedite the online order checkout process locate products in the aisles and online and check inventory on hand in fiscal 2017 we empowered our customers with additional selfhelp tools for example we invested in a better digital navigation experience through storespecific maps which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices 

we have also undertaken a number of store pilots in response to customer feedback around navigation and checkout these pilots include new more intuitive signage better lighting and a redesign of the front end of our store as part of these store pilots we added selfservice lockers at the front entrance to offer convenient pick up of online orders we plan to roll out these store pilots more broadly to our us stores over the next several years 

we continued to make investments in our website and mobile apps enhancements to these digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making their purchase while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices view our extended assortment and purchase products during fiscal 2017 we implemented a new ecommerce platform enhanced our search and mobile functionality increased checkout speed and expanded chat functionality with our online contact centers we have also begun to focus on voiceenabled commerce to further remove friction for our customers instore and online 

we do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction rather it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment to postpurchase care and support further we believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores we drive sales not just instore but also online in fiscal 2017 we saw increased traffic to our online properties and improved online sales conversion rates sales from our online channels increased over 21 during fiscal 2017 we will continue to leverage our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the endtoend customer experience 

connect products and services to customer needs 

we strive to be the number one retailer in product authority in home improvement by delivering product innovation assortment and value and by offering a range of home improvement services in fiscal 2017 we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our diy and pro customers while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online we also made two strategic acquisitions to further enhance our offerings to our customers 

a typical the home depot store stocks approximately 30000 to 40000 products during the year including both national brand name and proprietary items to enhance our merchandising capabilities we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2017 to better understand our customers provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location 

our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites including homedepotcom and blindscom in fiscal 2017 we expanded our offering of online décor categories though our acquisition of the company store an online retailer of textiles and décor products we also routinely use our merchandising tools to refine our online assortment to balance the extended choice with a more curated offering 

in fiscal 2017 we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values examples of these new products include ego ®  56v cordless selfpropelled mowers ppg ®  timeless™ paint samsung ®  activewash™ highefficiency washers and leviton ®  smart lighting controls 

during fiscal 2017 we continued to offer value to our customers through a wide range of our proprietary and exclusive brands highlights of these offerings include husky ®  hand tools tool storage and work benches water 

resistant gloves dual beam flashlights diamond tip screwdrivers 15in1 screwdrivernut drivers and 38 inch drive digital torque wrenches hampton bay ®  lighting ceiling fans and kitchen cabinets glacier bay ®  bath fixtures and toilets featuring a superclean™ toilet lifeproof ®  flooring including carpet carpet with petproof ®  technology laminate and vinyl flooring ecosmart ®  lighting featuring allglass led light bulbs vigoro ®  lawn care products and ridgid ®  and ryobi ®  power tools featuring ryobi ®  40v cordless push mowers we will continue to assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within the home depot’s portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands 

we also offer a number of services for our customers as noted above under “our customers” we provide a number of special programs for our pro customers to meet their particular needs and for our diy and difm customers we provide a number of installation services in fiscal 2017 we enhanced our tool rental offering through our acquisition of compact power currently we offer tool and equipment rentals at over 1000 locations across the us and canada providing value and convenience for both our pro and diy customers 

connect product to shelf site and customer 

we continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain these efforts are designed to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs which results in higher returns for our shareholders given the changing needs of our customers our goal is to create the fastest and most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement during fiscal 2017 we continued to lay the groundwork to meet this goal 

we centrally forecast and replenish over 97 of our products through sophisticated inventory management systems and a network of over 200 distribution centers this network includes multiple distribution center platforms in the us canada and mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products location transportation and delivery requirements these platforms primarily include rapid deployment centers stocking distribution centers bulk distribution centers and direct fulfillment centers 

in addition to our distribution centers we leverage our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient customer pickup return and delivery fulfillment locations for customers who shop online and wish to pickup or return merchandise at or have merchandise delivered from our us stores we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs bopis boss boris and bodfs which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage for example as of the end of fiscal 2017 over 45 of our us online orders were picked up in the store efficient delivery is also key we have developed specialized capabilities for delivering building materials which is particularly important to our pro customers during fiscal 2017 we implemented new and improved delivery capabilities from our stores including two and fourhour delivery windows and we piloted van and car options for faster delivery on small orders in certain markets   

a key component of this strategy is enabled through our technology portfolio which consists of a network of systems that help us centrally manage customer orders and optimize where when and how we fulfill them in order to maximize speed efficiency and the customer’s experience during fiscal 2017 we continued to improve com our customer order management platform and we completed the rollout of our delivery management system which substantially improves our ability to sell and execute deliveries from our stores 

we recognize that our customers’ expectations are changing rapidly and that our supply chain needs to be responsive to their expectations for how when and where they choose to receive our products and services we will continue to improve the productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement we refer to this process which encompasses a multiyear effort as one home depot supply chain 

competition our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to multichannel to exclusively online in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and 

appearance as well as presentation of merchandise our customers routinely use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online read product reviews and compare prices products and delivery options regardless of whether they shop instore or online further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments to build one home depot supply chain 

innovate our business model and value chain 

in the changing retail environment we must increase our investments to position our company for the future our customers view us as one home depot and expect us to function in an interconnected seamless manner to fully realize the one home depot experience we will continue to connect the various aspects of our business leverage our scale and invest in our physical locations our digital properties our associates product and innovation our pro and diy customers our services business and our supply chain underlying all of these investments is our continued investment in information technology which provides the backbone of the one home depot experience

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving as a result we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers suppliers and service providers ranging from traditional brickandmortar to 

multichannel to exclusively online in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement retailers electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies home décor retailers and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental 

we compete both instore and online primarily based on customer experience price quality availability assortment and delivery options with respect to our stores we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise our customers routinely use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online read product reviews and compare prices products and delivery options regardless of whether they shop instore or online further online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services with customers seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins 

we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional programs our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand in addition each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of – or within – a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding as noted above customers routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick timely and lowprice or free delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have our boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times options and costs customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates failure to maintain our stores utilize our store space effectively and offer a safe shopping environment to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs to provide quick and lowprice or free delivery alternatives to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups and to effectively 

implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage or healthcare benefits an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees conversely changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales customer data merchandise ordering inventory replenishment and order fulfillment for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks including the use of ransomware catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts may not be successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration as well as product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers as evidenced by our recent replatform of our homedepotcom website disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

the implementation of our store interconnected retail supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we recently announced our intent to substantially increase our investments to create the one home depot experience including significant investments over the next five years to build a one home depot supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide highquality service to our customers simplify customer interaction provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience and create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement products the cost 

and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers employing new webbased tools and services and addressing impacts on inventory levels could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term lead to product availability issues and impact profitability further accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations in addition our store and interconnected retail initiatives enhanced supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade policy changes or restrictions tariffs or importrelated taxes thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints thirdparty contract disputes supply or shipping interruptions or costs military conflicts acts of terrorism or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage and transmission of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update systems processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment as well as those of any companies we acquire there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the data breach any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs including costs to investigate and remediate as well as lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards paypal our private label credit cards an installment loan program trade credit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards 

and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

uncertainty regarding the housing market economic conditions political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services causing them to delay purchasing decisions or impacting their ability to pay for products and services other factors beyond our control – including unemployment and foreclosure rates inventory loss due to theft interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters acts of terrorism and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability military conflict acts of terrorism the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales and results of operations 

product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations 

regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even with adequate insurance and indemnification our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services including both national brand names and our proprietary products could suffer damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty in addition we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our ser standards which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency sources of supply and child and forced labor we have an ser audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of work performed by our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers however if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines lawsuits and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements as well as for property damage or personal injury in addition we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses which could adversely affect our business 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty in fiscal 2015 we acquired interline which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our pros in fiscal 2017 we acquired compact power and the company store to expand our product and service offerings with these and any other acquisitions we need to successfully integrate each target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data protection and cybersecurity the sale of some of our products transportation logistics international trade supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property energy costs or environmental matters including with respect to our installation services business could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations 

in fiscal 2017 congress enacted the tax act which significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations the ultimate impact of the tax act on us may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the us federal income tax code as we complete our analysis of the tax act we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made further uncertainties also exist in terms of how us states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these us federal income tax changes which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be negatively impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes and controls greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured for a number of different risk categories such as general liability including product liability workers compensation employee group medical automobile claims and network security and privacy liability with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

sales  we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales 

net sales  net sales for fiscal 2017 increased   63 billion  or 67  to 1009 billion  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth hurricanerelated sales contributed approximately 662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017 

comparable sales  comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes sales at all locations physical and online open greater than 52 weeks including remodels and relocations and excluding closed stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 365th day of operation acquisitions digital or otherwise are included after we own them for greater than 52 weeks with the exception of interline which is excluded from comparable sales comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap 

total comparable sales increased   68 in fiscal 2017 the increase  in comparable sales reflected a number of factors including the execution of our strategy and broadbased growth across our stores and online online sales which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations represented 67 of net sales and grew 215 during fiscal 2017 all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales except for one which was flat in fiscal 2017 comparable sales for our lumber electrical tools appliances flooring building materials and indoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average during fiscal 2017 our comparable customer transactions increased 22  during fiscal 2017 further our comparable average ticket increased 45 in fiscal 2017 due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments such as appliances and flooring 

gross profit   gross profit increased   20 billion  or 63  to 344 billion  in fiscal 2017 gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 340  in fiscal 2017 compared to 342  in fiscal 2016 the modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 reflected the impact of lower margin hurricanerelated sales and higher shrink partially offset by benefits from our supply chain 

operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sga and depreciation and amortization 

selling general  administrative    sga increased   732 million  or 43  to 179 billion in fiscal 2017 and included approximately 170 million of hurricanerelated expenses as a percent of net sales sga was 177  for fiscal 2017 compared to 181 for fiscal 2016 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control 

depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization increased   57 million  or 32  in fiscal 2017 the decrease  in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 18 in fiscal 2017 from 19  in fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment 

interest and other net   interest and other net was 983 million for fiscal 2017 compared to 936 million for fiscal 2016 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 and reflected additional interest expense in fiscal 2017 resulting from higher longterm debt balances in fiscal 2017 offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

provision for income taxes   our combined effective income tax rate was 370 for fiscal 2017 compared to 363 for fiscal 2016 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 reflected a net 127 million charge resulting from the enactment of the tax act the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 also reflected a 106 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for sharebased payment awards as a result of our adoption of asu no 201609 see note 1  and note 5  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

diluted earnings per share   diluted earnings per share were 729 for fiscal 2017 compared to 645 for fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of 009 per share as a result of the adoption of asu no 201609 as well as decreases of 011 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the tax act and 006 per share due to the onetime bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the tax act 

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

sales 

net sales    net sales for fiscal 2016 increased 61 billion or 69 to 946 billion the increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth as well as sales from interline which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 

the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from a stronger us dollar which negatively impacted total sales growth by 549 million in fiscal 2016 

comparable sales  total comparable sales increased 56 for fiscal 2016 which reflected a number of factors including the execution of our strategy improved strength across our business and an improved us home improvement market online sales represented 59 of net sales and grew 193 during fiscal 2016 all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales for fiscal 2016 comparable sales for our appliances tools lumber lighting décor building materials and indoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average for fiscal 2016 further our comparable customer transactions increased 28 for fiscal 2016 and comparable average ticket increased 27 for fiscal 2016 due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in merchandising departments such as appliances flooring and roofing offset in part by a stronger us dollar 

gross profit gross profit for fiscal 2016 increased 20 billion or 68 to 323 billion gross profit as a percent of net sales or gross profit margin was 342 for both fiscal 2016 and 2015 gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 reflected the impact of product mix changes offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity and benefits from reaching higher levels of coop allowances and rebates in certain category classes 

operating expenses 

selling general  administrative    sga for fiscal 2016 increased 331 million or 20 to 171 billion sga included data breachrelated pretax expenses of 37 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 128 million of pretax net expenses in fiscal 2015 as a percent of net sales sga was 181 for fiscal 2016 compared to 190 for fiscal 2015 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and strong expense control 

depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2016 increased 64 million or 38 to 18 billion depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 19 for both fiscal 2016 and 2015 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected minor expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment 

interest and other net   in fiscal 2016 we recognized 936 million of interest and other net compared to 753 million for fiscal 2015 interest and other net for fiscal 2015 included a 144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for fiscal 2016 compared to 09 for fiscal 2015 due primarily to the hd supply pretax gain in fiscal 2015 noted above and higher longterm debt balances in fiscal 2016 

provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 363 for fiscal 2016 and 364 for fiscal 2015 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were 645 for fiscal 2016 compared to 546 for fiscal 2015 expenses related to the data breach resulted in decreases of 002 and 006 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively the gain on the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply contributed a benefit of 007 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 

nongaap financial measures 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance we supplement our reporting with certain nongaap financial measures however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures nongaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies 

return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base we define roic as nopat a nongaap financial measure for the most recent twelvemonth period divided by average debt and equity we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending longterm debt including current installments and equity for the most recent twelvemonth period 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap measure follows

 additional information 

for information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities  cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation operations and occupancy costs 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 22 billion  in fiscal 2017 and increased 410 million  in fiscal 2016 and primarily reflected an increase in net earnings excluding changes in working capital and noncash items from operations the increase in earnings resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage in both fiscal years 

cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

investing activities cash used in investing activities primarily reflected 

 financing activities cash used in financing activities primarily reflected 

 cash and cash equivalents at end of year  at january 28 2018  we had 36 billion  in cash and cash equivalents of which 32 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our current cash position access to the longterm debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

debt and derivatives 

in december 2017 we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper programs from 20 billion  to 30 billion  all of our shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were under these commercial paper programs in connection with these programs we have backup credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 30 billion  in december 2017 we replaced our fiveyear 20 billion  credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december 2019 with a new substantially identical fiveyear 20 billion  credit facility that expires in december 2022  in addition we added a separate 364day 10 billion  credit facility that expires in december 2018  at january 28 2018  we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources at january 28 2018  and january 29 2017  there were 16 billion  and 710 million  respectively of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs we also issue senior notes from time to time 

we use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain longterm debt see note 4  and note 7  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements 

leases 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers see note 3  and note 4  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our capital and operating leases 

share repurchases 

in fiscal 2017 we repurchased 495 million shares of our common stock for 80 billion through asr agreements and open market transactions in february 2017 our board of directors authorized a 150 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization in december 2017 our board of directors authorized a new 150 billion share repurchase program that replaced the february 2017 authorization see note 6  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchases 

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations at january 28 2018  were as follows 



————— 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

merchandise inventories 

we value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the firstin firstout method with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method under the retail inventory method inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market 

as the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups markdowns and inventory losses or shrink there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the 

lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation 

if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows we then measure the asset’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers’ compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we have no stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed we estimate the liability for sales returns including the estimated gross profit impact based on our historical return levels and believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns 

we defer revenue and the related gross profit for payments received from customers for which the customer has not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer this amount is recorded as deferred revenue we estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rates which we believe to be a reasonable reflection of future rates if these estimates significantly differ from actual amounts our net sales and gross profit could be adversely impacted 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and coop advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain coop advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain coop advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our longterm debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at january 28 2018  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements floating rate debt principal was 175 billion or approximately 7 of our debt portfolio a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately  85 billion  of our revenue for fiscal 2017  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

commodity price risk we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

our business 

operating strategy   

our strategic framework is founded on our threelegged stool of customer experience product authority and productivity and efficiency driven by effective capital allocation all united by the goal of providing an interconnected retail experience to drive value for our customers our associates our suppliers and our shareholders the retail landscape is rapidly evolving and our goal is to become more agile in responding to the changing competitive landscape and customer preferences as customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how when and where they want we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels featuring innovative and curated product choices delivered in a fast and costefficient manner will be a key enabler for future success 

becoming a bestinclass interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and instore shopping continues to blur and customers demand increased convenience and value under customer experience we are focused on connecting our associates to customer needs and connecting our stores to our online experience under product authority we are focused on connecting our product and services to customer needs including offering local and customized assortments to meet the unique needs of our different communities under productivity and efficiency we are focused on connecting our merchandise from our suppliers to our customers by optimizing our supply chain overall we are collaborating more closely throughout our organization and with our business partners to build an interconnected experience for customers that offers an endtoend solution for their home improvement needs 

customer experience 

customer experience is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates our commitment to customer service has been and will continue to be a key part of the customer experience but we recognize that the customer experience includes more than just customer service and we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores online on the job site or in their homes 

our customers  we serve three primary customer groups and we have different approaches to meet their particular needs 

 with our acquisition of interline brands inc interline in august 2015 we established a platform in the maintenance repair and operations mro market where we serve primarily institutional customers such as educational and healthcare institutions hospitality businesses and national apartment complexes we also gained additional competencies relevant to our large professional customers including outside sales and account management expanded assortment of product expanded financing options and last mile delivery capabilities 

 2 

we recognize that our pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform our goal is to develop a comprehensive set of capabilities for our professional customers to provide solutions across every purchase opportunity such as supplying both recurring mro needs and renovation products and services to property managers or providing inventory management solutions for specialty tradesmen’s replenishment needs we believe that by bringing our best resources to bear for each individual customer we can provide a differentiated customer experience and enhanced value proposition for our professional customers 

we help our diy difm and pro customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products through thirdparty credit providers our private label credit program includes other benefits such as a 365day return policy and for our pros commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms in fiscal 2016  our customers opened approximately 42 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at fiscal year end the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 13 million private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23 of sales in fiscal 2016  

our associates our associates are key to our customer experience we empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service and we strive to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers in fiscal 2016  we continued to implement new initiatives to improve freight handling in the stores as well as project sync which is discussed in more detail below under logistics all of these programs are designed to make our freight handling process more efficient which allows our associates to devote more time to the customer experience and makes working at the home depot a better experience for them we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service 

at the end of fiscal 2016  we employed approximately 406000 associates of whom approximately 27000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we measure associate satisfaction regularly and we believe that our employee relations are very good 

interconnected retail   in fiscal 2016  we continued to enhance our customers’ interconnected shopping experiences through a variety of initiatives our associates continued to use first phones our webenabled handheld devices to help customers complete online sales in the aisle expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods locate products in the aisles and online and check inventory on hand we have also empowered our customers with improved product location and inventory availability tools on our website and mobile app during fiscal 2016  we launched a redesign of our website to provide our customers with better search capabilities and a faster checkout experience and we upgraded our mobile app enhancements to our online and mobile properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers who research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices view our extended assortment and purchase products 

we also recognize that customers desire greater flexibility and convenience when it comes to receiving their products and services we strive to deliver on this customer expectation by blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience a key component of this strategy is enabled through our new customer order management platform com which we rolled out to all us stores in fiscal 2016  com provides a common management system for customer orders providing greater visibility and a more seamless and frictionless experience for our customers and associates com also provides the foundation for the enhanced delivery option we rolled out to all us stores in fiscal 2016  buy online deliver from store bodfs bodfs allows customers to schedule a specific delivery window and it complements our existing interconnected retail programs buy online pickup in store bopis buy online ship to store boss and buy online return in store boris during the year we also enabled a dynamic eta estimated time of arrival feature for online orders which provides our customers with a faster and more accurate delivery date based on their location 

we do not view the customer experience as a specific transaction rather it encompasses an entire process from inspiration and knowhow to purchase and fulfillment to postpurchase care and support further we believe that by connecting our stores to online and online to our stores we drive sales not just instore but also online in fiscal 2016  we saw increased traffic to our online properties and improved online sales conversion rates sales from our online channels increased over 19 compared to fiscal 2015 we will continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the endtoend customer experience

product authority 

product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy which is focused on delivering product innovation assortment and value in fiscal 2016  we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our diy difm and pro customers while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online 

our products a typical the home depot store stocks approximately 30000  to 40000  products during the year including both national brand name and proprietary items to enhance our merchandising capabilities we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2016  to better understand our customers provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites including homedepotcom and blindscom we also routinely use our merchandising tools to refine our online assortment to balance the extended choice with a more curated offering 

in fiscal 2016  we introduced a number of innovative and distinctive products to our customers at attractive values examples of these new products include feit ®  led edgelit flat panel lighting pergo ®  outlast flooring thomasville ®  studio 1904 kitchen cabinets dewalt flexvolt ®  system for power tools diablo ®  carbide hole saws defiant ®  led security lights makita ®  subcompact drills and milwaukee m18 fuel ®  with one key™ power tools compatible with the high demand™ 90ah battery 

during fiscal 2016  we continued to offer value to our customers through our proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments highlights of these offerings include husky ®  hand tools tool storage and work benches everbilt ®  hardware and fasteners hampton bay ®  lighting ceiling fans and patio furniture vigoro ®  lawn care products ridgid ®  and ryobi ®  power tools glacier bay ®  bath fixtures hdx ®  storage and cleaning products and home decorators collection ®  furniture and home décor we will continue to assess departments and categories both online and instore for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within the home depot’s portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands 

we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain highquality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world in fiscal 2016  in addition to our us sourcing operations we maintained sourcing offices in mexico canada china india southeast asia and europe 

the percentage of net sales of each of our major product categories and related services for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data net sales inside the us were 866 billion  805 billion  and 747 billion  for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively net sales outside the us were 80 billion  80 billion  and 85 billion  for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively longlived assets which consist of net property and equipment inside the us totaled 195 billion  199 billion  and 202 billion  as of january 29 2017  january 31 2016  and february 1 2015  respectively longlived assets outside the us totaled 24 billion  23 billion  and 25 billion  as of january 29 2017  january 31 2016  and february 1 2015  respectively 

quality assurance   our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international federal state and local laws in addition we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products we also have a global supplier social and environmental responsibility program designed to ensure that suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility 

environmentallypreferred products and programs the home depot is committed to sustainable business practices – from the environmental impact of our operations to our sourcing activities to our involvement within the communities in which we do business we believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders for example we offer a growing selection of environmentallypreferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy water and money through our eco options ®  program introduced in 2007 we have created product categories that allow customers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency water conservation healthy home clean air and sustainable forestry as of the end of fiscal 2016  our eco options ®  program included over 10000 products through this program we sell energy star ®  certified appliances led light bulbs tankless water heaters and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills we estimate that in fiscal 2016  we helped customers save over 900 million in electricity costs through sales of energy star ®  certified products we also estimate our customers saved over 76 billion gallons of water resulting in over 640 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2016  through the sales of our watersense ® labeled bath faucets showerheads aerators toilets and irrigation controllers our 2016

responsibility report available on our website at httpscorporatehomedepotcomresponsibility describes many of our other environmentallypreferred products that promote energy efficiency water conservation clean air and a healthy home 

we continue to offer store recycling programs nationwide such as an instore compact fluorescent light cfl bulb recycling program launched in 2008 this service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all us stores we also maintain an instore rechargeable battery recycling program launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with call2recycle this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the us through our recycling programs in fiscal 2016  we helped recycle over 860000 pounds of cfl bulbs and over 1 million pounds of rechargeable batteries in fiscal 2016  we also recycled over 180000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program as well as over 225000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our us operations we believe our environmentallypreferred product selection and our recycling efforts drive sales which in turn benefits our shareholders in addition to our customers and the environment 

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our industry is highly competitive with competition based primarily on customer experience price store location and appearance and quality availability assortment and presentation of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers now routinely use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business including our expanding proprietary brands such as hdx ®  husky ®  hampton bay ®  home decorators collection ®  glacier bay ®  and vigoro ®  we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation 

we continue to drive productivity and efficiency by building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to ensure product availability for our customers while managing our costs which results in higher returns for our shareholders during fiscal 2016  we continued to focus on optimizing our endtoend supply chain network and improving our inventory transportation and distribution productivity 

logistics we continue to invest in our supply chain by optimizing our network through initiatives like supply chain synchronization or project sync as described in more detail below project sync is a recent initiative to improve our instock rates inventory productivity and logistics costs during fiscal 2016 we rolled out the first phase of project sync to all us stores and we continue to onboard new suppliers this is a multiyear multiphase endeavor which we plan to implement in each of our distribution flow paths 

our overall distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rapid deployment centers rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management through project sync we can significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf project sync requires deep collaboration among our suppliers transportation providers rdcs and stores as well as rigorous planning and information technology development to create an engineered flow schedule that shortens and stabilizes lead time resulting in more predictable and consistent freight flow as we continue to roll out project sync throughout our supply chain over the next several years we plan to create an endtoend solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our rdc and store associates to our customers 

over the past several years we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology this has helped us improve our product availability and our 

 5 

inventory productivity at the same time at the end of fiscal 2016  over 95 of our us store products were ordered through central inventory management 

we operate multiple distribution center platforms tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on the types of products local geography and transportation and delivery requirements the following table sets forth the number and type of distribution centers in our network as of the end of fiscal 2016  



to better serve our online customers we offer a variety of delivery methods to get product to each customer’s preferred location we completed the rollout of three new us dfcs in fiscal 2015 to support our online growth we also operate one dfc for our home decorators collection orders and one dfc for big and bulky orders our dfcs enable us to reduce delivery costs and lead time and improve the overall customer experience by shipping online orders directly to the customer in addition with our acquisition of interline in fiscal 2015 we added more than 100 distribution points with fast delivery of a broad assortment of mro products we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network 

in addition to the distribution and fulfillment centers described above we leverage our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient customer pickup return and delivery fulfillment locations for customers who shop online and wish to pickup or return merchandise at our us stores we have fully implemented our bopis boss and boris programs which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 approximately 45 of our online us orders were picked up in a store for customers who would like the option to have storebased orders delivered directly to their home or job site we pick pack and ship orders to customers from our stores our bodfs program which we rolled out in fiscal 2016 allows our customers to select their preferred delivery date and time windows for storebased deliveries our supply chain and logistics strategies will continue to be focused on providing our customers high product availability with convenient and low cost fulfillment options 

commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible operations   the home depot focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain and packaging store construction and maintenance and as noted above under environmentallypreferred products and programs product selection and recycling programs for our customers 

in 2015 we announced two major sustainability commitments for 2020 our first goal is to reduce our us stores’ energy use by 20 over 2010 levels and our second goal is to produce and procure on an annual basis 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources such as wind solar and fuel cell technology as of the end of fiscal 2016 we are on track to exceed both of our goals before the end of 2020 we are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our us facilities and continuing to invest in renewable energy 

 6 

additionally we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2016  145 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers we estimate our annual water savings from these units to be over 500000 gallons per store for total water savings of over 725 million gallons in fiscal 2016  our 2016 responsibility report which uses the global reporting initiative gri framework for sustainability reporting provides more information on sustainability efforts in other aspects of our operations our 2016 responsibility report is available on our website at httpscorporatehomedepotcomresponsibility 

our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions in 2016 we received three significant awards from the us environmental protection agency epa the energy star ® division named us retail partner of the year – sustained excellence for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and we received the 2016 watersense ®  sustained excellence award for our overall excellence in water efficiency we also received the epa’s smartway excellence award which recognizes the home depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency we also participate in the cdp formerly known as the carbon disclosure project reporting process cdp is an independent international notforprofit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure disclose manage and share environmental information in 2016 we received a score of a out of a range from a to e from the cdp reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation adaptation and transparency we also were named an industry leader by the cdp 

we are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate’s role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

returning value to shareholders   as noted above we drive productivity and efficiency through our capital allocation decisions with a focus on expense control this discipline drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through 70 billion in share repurchases and 34 billion  in dividends in fiscal 2016  as discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer experience price store location and appearance and quality availability assortment and presentation of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies and other retailers as well as with providers of home improvement services in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers now routinely use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time we use our marketing advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our 

 7 

margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional programs our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as we continue to see increasing strength in the housing and home improvement market resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels in addition each of our primary customer groups – diy difm and pro – have different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of – or within – a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick and lowcost delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have implemented programs like boss bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers’ needs and expectations customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs to provide quick and lowcost delivery alternatives to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage or healthcare benefits an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly as the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales merchandise ordering inventory replenishment and order fulfillment for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks including the use of ransomware 

 8 

catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems such efforts may not be successful as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments we also continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers as evidenced by our recent redesign of our homedepotcom website disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage and transmission of customers’ personal information preferences and payment card information as well as other confidential information such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches system compromises or misuses of data any future significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in significant costs lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of work performed by our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers however if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits for violations of regulatory requirements as well as for property damage or personal injury in addition we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses which could adversely affect our business 

we may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

in fiscal 2015 we completed the acquisition of interline which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our professional customers and increased our share of the mro market during fiscal 2016 we continued to develop and implement our strategy with interline our goal is to serve all of our different pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail services and mro markets and this strategy depends in part on our continuing integration of interline as with any acquisition we need to successfully integrate interline’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if interline is successfully integrated the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the interline business and the wholesale market 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations healthcare data protection and cybersecurity the sale of some of our products transportation logistics international trade supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences potential tariffs and other importrelated taxes greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we have incurred losses related to the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the data breach we may incur additional losses or experience future operational impacts on our business which could have an adverse impact on our operations financial results and reputation 

the data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems since the data breach occurred we have recorded 198 million of pretax expenses net of expected insurance recoveries in connection with the data breach as described in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we are still facing a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders and an investigation by a number of state attorneys general these matters may adversely affect how we operate our business divert the attention of management from the operation of the business have an adverse effect on our reputation and result in additional costs and fines

in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2016  net cash provided by operating activities was 98 billion  compared to 94 billion  for fiscal 2015  this increase was primarily due to a 948 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage partially offset by a 442 million decrease in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses related to the timing of purchases and payments and a 223 million increase in merchandise inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016  was 16 billion  compared to 30 billion  for fiscal 2015  this change was primarily due to 17 billion in payments for businesses acquired net in fiscal 2015 related to the acquisition of interline 

 23 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016  was 79 billion  compared to 58 billion  for fiscal 2015  this change was primarily due to 20 billion less in net incremental longterm debt issued in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

in fiscal 2016 we repurchased 53 million shares of our common stock for 70 billion through the open market since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 2002 and through fiscal 2016 we have repurchased 13 billion shares of our common stock for a total of 671 billion in february 2017 our board of directors authorized a new 150 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization

in fiscal 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of 10 billion accounted for as cash flow hedges to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the february 2016 issuance in connection with the february 2016 issuance we paid 89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements this amount net of income taxes is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the april 2026 notes

in november 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 10 2018  with a notional amount of 500 million  accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 225 senior notes due september 10 2018 for variable interest equal to libor plus 88 basis points at january 29 2017  the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 3 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

also in november 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 15 2020  with a notional amount of 500 million  accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 395  senior notes due september 15 2020  for variable interest equal to libor plus 183 basis points at january 29 2017  the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 10 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 24 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 20 billion  all of our shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2016  and 2015  were under these commercial paper programs in connection with these programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion  the credit facility expires in december 2019  and contains various restrictive covenants at january 29 2017  we were in compliance with all of the covenants and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources at january 29 2017  and january 31 2016  there were 710 million  and 350 million  respectively of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current installments of longterm debt in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

as of january 29 2017  we had 25 billion  in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our current cash position access to the longterm debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

offbalance sheet arrangements

contractual obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at january 29 2017  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 93 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 7 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of january 29 2017  we had net of discounts  220 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of january 29 2017  was  236 billion  

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately  80 billion  and  80 billion  of our revenue for fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 70  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2016  or 2015  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent 

 26 

shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers’ compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  we maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security this coverage is discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

 27 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three  years we completed a quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016 

in fiscal 2016  we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our us canada and mexico reporting units the fair values of these reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows and the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each respective reporting unit there were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to 12 years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant there were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014

our business 

operating strategy   

since 2009 we have been guided by a consistent strategic framework organized around our customers our products and our disciplined use of capital tied together through our interconnected retail initiative in fiscal 2015  we announced an evolution of this strategy to reflect the changing needs of our customers and our business the fundamental aspects remain the same but we are now focused more than ever on connecting various aspects of our business to drive value for our customers our associates our suppliers and our shareholders our current strategic framework is comprised of three key initiatives – customer experience product authority and productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – tied together by our interconnecting retail initiative as customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how when and where they want we believe that providing a seamless and frictionless shopping experience across multiple channels featuring innovative and expanded product choices delivered in a fast and costefficient manner will be a key enabler for future success becoming a bestinclass interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and instore shopping continues to blur and customers demand increased value and convenience 

interconnecting retail is woven through each of our other three initiatives as discussed in more detail below for example under our customer experience initiative we are focused on connecting our stores to our online experience and connecting service to customer needs under our product authority initiative we are focused on connecting our product assortment to local needs and connecting our customers with product information to inspire and empower them under our productivity and efficiency initiative we are focused on connecting our merchandise from our suppliers to our customers by optimizing our supply chain overall we are collaborating more closely both internally and externally through deeper crossfunctional work and a more integrated longerterm approach with our suppliers and other business partners to build complete endtoend solutions 

customer experience 

our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates our commitment to customer service is a key part of this initiative and in fiscal 2015  to underscore the importance of customer service we retrained our store associates on our customer first program we recognize that the customer experience includes more than just customer service and we have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores online on the job site or in their homes 

our customers  we serve three primary customer groups and we have different approaches to meet their particular needs 

  2 

online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment this program introduced in fiscal 2013 has continued to gain traction with almost 4 million customers enrolled by the end of fiscal 2015  

we also recognize that our pros have differing needs depending on the type of work they perform our goal is to develop a wide spectrum of solutions for all of our professional customers such as supplying both recurring mro needs and core building materials to largescale property managers and providing inventory management solutions for our traditional pro customers we believe developing a unified approach to service all the needs of our pros will differentiate us from competitors who are solely traditional retail installation or mro companies 

we help our diy difm and pro customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through thirdparty credit providers we also help certain of our pros through our own programs in fiscal 2015  our customers opened approximately 32 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at fiscal year end the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 12 million private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23 of sales in fiscal 2015  in addition in the us we relaunched our private label credit program at the end of fiscal 2015  with additional benefits including a 365day return policy for all of our customers and commercial fuel rewards and extended payment terms for our pros 

our associates our associates are key to our customer experience initiative as noted above we empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our customer first training program and we strive to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers in fiscal 2015  we began to roll out a number of new initiatives to improve freight handling in the stores as well as project sync which is discussed in more detail below under logistics all of these programs are designed to make our freight handling process more efficient which allows our associates to devote more time to the customer experience and makes working at the home depot a better experience for them we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service 

at the end of fiscal 2015  we employed approximately 385000 associates of whom approximately 24000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we measure associate satisfaction regularly and we believe that our employee relations are very good

quality assurance   our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international federal state and local laws in addition we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety quality and performance standards for our proprietary branded products we also have a global supplier social and environmental responsibility program designed to ensure that all suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility 

environmentallyfriendly products and programs the home depot is committed to sustainable business practices – from the environmental impact of our operations to our sourcing activities to our involvement within the communities in which we do business we believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders for example we offer a growing selection of environmentallypreferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy water and money through our eco options ®  program introduced in 2007 we have created product categories that allow customers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency water conservation healthy home clean air and sustainable forestry as of the end of fiscal 2015  our eco options ®  program included over 10000 products through this program we sell energy star ®  certified appliances led light bulbs tankless water heaters and other products that enable our customers to save on their utility bills we estimate that in fiscal 2015  we helped customers save over 700 million in electricity costs through sales of energy star ®  certified products and over 300 million in product costs through energy star ®  rebate programs we also estimate our customers saved over 70 billion gallons of water resulting in over 590 million in water bill savings in fiscal 2015  through the sales of our watersense ® labeled bath faucets showerheads aerators toilets and irrigation controllers 

we continue to offer store recycling programs nationwide such as an instore compact fluorescent light cfl bulb recycling program launched in 2008 this service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all us stores we also maintain an instore rechargeable battery recycling program launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with call2recycle this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the us through these recycling programs in fiscal 2015  we helped recycle over 680000 pounds of cfl bulbs and over 930000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers in fiscal 2015  we also recycled over 170000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program as well as over 200000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our us stores we believe our eco options ®  program and our recycling efforts drive sales which in turn benefits our shareholders in addition to our customers and the environment

interconnecting retail   a typical the home depot store stocks approximately 30000  to 40000  products during the year including both national brand name and proprietary items to enhance our merchandising capabilities we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2015  to better understand our customers provide more localized assortments to fit customer demand and optimize space to dedicate the right square footage to the right products in the right location we also continued to use the resources of blacklocus inc a data analytics and pricing firm we acquired in fiscal 2012 to help us make focused merchandising decisions based on large complex data sets 

our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our home depot home decorators collection and blindscom websites we continue to enhance our websites and mobile experience by improving navigation and search functionalities to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide our customers with flexibility and convenience for their purchases for example through our bopis boss boris and bodfs programs in addition we invest in content such as videos room scenes buying guides and howto information and we routinely assess our online assortment to balance choice with curation so that we provide value to our customers as a result of these efforts in fiscal 2015  we enhanced the customer experience and saw increased traffic to our websites improved online sales conversion rates and a larger percentage of orders being picked up in our stores for fiscal 2015  we had over 14 billion visits to our online properties sales from our online channels increased over 25 compared to fiscal 2014 and over 40 of our online orders were picked up in a store 

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our industry is highly competitive with competition based primarily on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business including our expanding proprietary brands such as hdx ®  husky ®  hampton bay ®  home decorators collection ®  glacier bay ®  and vigoro ®  we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation 

we have advanced this initiative by building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to better ensure product availability to our customers while managing our costs which results in higher returns for our shareholders during fiscal 2015  we continued to focus on optimizing our supply chain network and improving our inventory transportation and distribution productivity 

logistics our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers effectively using our investment in inventory and managing total supply chain costs one of our principal 2015  initiatives has been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network by beginning initial work on a multiyear program called supply chain synchronization or project sync 

our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rapid deployment centers rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management we have 18 mechanized rdcs in the us and two recently opened mechanized rdcs in canada through project sync which is being rolled out gradually to suppliers in several us rdcs we can significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf project sync requires deep collaboration among our suppliers transportation providers rdcs and stores as well as rigorous planning and information technology development to create an engineered flow schedule that shortens and stabilizes lead time resulting in 

 5 

more predictable and consistent freight flow as we continue to roll out project sync throughout our supply chain over the next several years we plan to create an endtoend solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our rdc and store associates to our customers 

over the past several years we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology this has helped us improve our product availability and our inventory productivity at the same time at the end of fiscal 2015  over 95 of our us store products were ordered through central inventory management 

in addition to our rdcs at the end of fiscal 2015  we operated 34 bulk distribution centers which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks in the us and canada 22 stocking distribution centers in the us canada and mexico and ten specialty distribution centers which include offshore consolidation and return logistics centers in the us and canada we also utilize four us transload facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports for our imported product these facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network 

interconnecting retail to support our online growth in fiscal 2015  we opened the third of our three new direct fulfillment centers dfcs we expect these facilities to enable us to reach 90 of our us customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping which provides our customers with a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders for nonparcel orders originating from our dfcs we have fully implemented boss via rdc delivery to provide our customers with a less expensive store pickup alternative with our acquisition of interline we have also added more than 90 distribution points with fast delivery of a broad assortment of mro products 

in addition to the distribution and fulfillment centers described above we leverage our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient customer pickup return and delivery fulfillment locations for customers who shop online and wish to pickup or return merchandise at our us stores we have fully implemented our bopis boss and boris programs which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage for customers who would like the option to have storebased orders delivered directly to their home or job site we pick pack and ship orders to customers from our stores we will continue our roll out of bodfs during fiscal 2016 allowing online customers to select their preferred delivery date and time windows for storebased deliveries our supply chain and logistics strategies will continue to be focused on providing our customers high product availability with convenient and low cost fulfillment options 

commitment to sustainability and environmentally responsible operations   the home depot focuses on sustainable operations and is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain store construction and maintenance and as noted above under environmentallyfriendly products and programs product selection and recycling programs for our customers 

in our 2015 sustainability report available on our corporate website under corporate responsibility  thd and the environment we reported that we had significantly surpassed our energy and carbon reduction goals set in 2010 and announced two new sustainability goals for 2020 our 2010 goals were to reduce our kilowatt hours kwh per square foot in our us stores by 20 over 2004 levels and to reduce our supply chain carbon emissions by 20 over 2010 levels by 2015 we estimate that we have reduced those levels by over 30 and over 35 respectively as of the end of fiscal 2015 from 2014 to 2015 alone we reduced our kwh per square foot by approximately 36 our new 2020 sustainability commitments are to reduce our us stores’ energy use by 20 over 2010 levels and to produce and procure on an annual basis 135 megawatts of energy for our stores through renewable or alternate energy sources such as wind solar and fuel cell technology we are committed to implementing strict operational standards that establish energy efficient operations in all of our us facilities and continuing to invest in renewable energy our 2015 sustainability report also uses the global reporting initiative gri framework for sustainability reporting 

additionally we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in our stores in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2015  145 of our stores used reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers we estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500000 gallons per store for total water savings of over 68 million gallons in fiscal 2015  

our commitment to corporate sustainability has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions in 2015 we received three significant awards from the us environmental protection agency epa the energy star ® division named us retail partner of the year – sustained excellence for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and we received the 2015 watersense ®  sustained excellence award for our overall excellence in water efficiency we also received the epa’s 

 6 

smartway excellence award which recognizes the home depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency we also participate in the cdp formerly known as the carbon disclosure project reporting process cdp is an independent international notforprofit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure disclose manage and share environmental information in 2015 we scored 99 out of 100 from the cdp for our disclosure placing us among the highest scoring companies in the index and near the top of our sector we also were named as an industry leader by the cdp and received a performance band ranking of a out of a range from a to e reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation adaptation and transparency 

we are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate’s role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

returning value to shareholders   as noted above we drive productivity and efficiency through our capital allocation decisions with a focus on expense control this discipline drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through 70 billion in share repurchases and 30 billion in dividends in fiscal 2015  as discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

data breach 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached which impacted customers who used payment cards at our us and canadian stores the data breach for a description of matters related to the data breach see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores paint stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores mro companies and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of customer service and customer relationships to deliver a superior customer experience our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 7 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as the housing and home improvement market continues to recover resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels in addition each of our primary customer groups – diy difm and pro – have different needs and expectations many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products and they often expect quick and lowcost delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have implemented programs like boss bopis and direct fulfillment and are rolling out bodfs but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers’ needs and expectations customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping environment that our customers desire failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs and to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage or healthcare benefits an inability to provide wages andor benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunities increase there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

we have incurred losses related to our data breach and we are still in the process of determining the full impact of related government investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations which could have an adverse impact on our operations financial results and reputation 

the data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems since the data breach occurred we have recorded 161 million of pretax expenses net of expected insurance recoveries in connection with the data breach as described in more detail in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we are facing putative class actions filed in the us and canada and a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders in the us and other claims have been and may be asserted on behalf of customers payment card issuing banks shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach we are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies these claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business divert the attention of management from the operation of the business have an adverse effect on our reputation and result in additional costs and fines in addition the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief which could 

 8 

materially increase our data security costs adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage and transmission of customers’ personal information consumer preferences and payment card information as well as confidential information about our associates our suppliers and our company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data any future significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost sales fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards paypal our private label credit cards and installment loan program and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems as reflected in our recent data breach if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

uncertainty regarding the housing market economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact our customers’ confidence or financial condition causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services or delay purchasing or payment for those products and services other factors beyond our control – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and 

 9 

other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to analyze process store manage and protect transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business for these systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems we may not be successful in doing so as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments for example to improve our special order process we are currently rolling out com our new customer order management system which our customers will be able to access online and we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive userfriendly interface for our customers disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability military conflict the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives such as project sync and com are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to 

 10 

provide highquality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy which includes the integration of interline to expand our business with professional customers and in the mro market which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

in fiscal 2015 we completed the acquisition of interline which we believe will enhance our ability to serve our professional customers and increase our share of the mro market our goal is to serve all of our different pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail services and mro markets and this strategy depends in part on the successful integration of interline as with any acquisition we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated synergies or benefits of the interline acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation furthermore even if interline is successfully integrated the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the interline business 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations cybersecurity and data privacy the sale of some of our products transportation logistics supply chain transparency taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations in addition recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers in addition our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts additionally involvement in these lawsuits investigations and inquiries and other proceedings may involve significant expense divert management’s attention and resources from other matters and impact the reputation of the company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings data 

net sales increased 64  to  885 billion  for the fiscal year ended january 31 2016  fiscal 2015  from  832 billion  for the fiscal year ended february 1 2015  fiscal 2014  our total comparable store sales increased 56  in fiscal 2015  driven by a 40 increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 16 increase in our comparable store average ticket comparable store sales for our us stores increased 71 in fiscal 2015  

for fiscal 2015  we reported net earnings of  70 billion  and diluted earnings per share of  546  compared to net earnings of  63 billion  and diluted earnings per share of  471  for fiscal 2014  

the results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 included 128 million and 33 million respectively of pretax net expenses related to the data breach that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 these charges resulted in decreases of 006 and 002 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 also included a 144 million and a 323 million  pretax gain respectively related to the sales of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply holdings inc hd supply these gains contributed 007 and 015 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from our stores locations or distribution centers to customers and for online fulfillment center costs under the new accounting policy these costs are included in cost of sales whereas they were previously included in operating expenses the consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2014 and 2013 have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy the impact of this reclassification was an increase of 565 million and 475 million to cost of sales for fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively and a corresponding decrease to operating expenses in the same periods this reclassification had no impact on net sales operating income net earnings or earnings per share 

data breach 

as previously reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at selfcheckout systems in our us and canadian stores since the breach we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our us and canadian stores we have also rolled out emv chip card technology in our us stores which adds extra layers of payment card protection for customers who use emv enabled chip cards our canadian stores were already enabled with emv chip card technology 

litigation claims and government investigations 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the payment card networks made claims against us for costs that they assert they or their issuing banks incurred in connection with the data breach including incremental counterfeit fraud losses and nonordinary course operating expenses such as card reissuance costs and we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses we expected to incur in connection with those claims in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 we entered into settlement agreements with american express discover mastercard and visa with respect to their claims 

in addition at least 57  putative class actions have been filed in courts in the us and canada allegedly arising from the data breach the us class actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia the district court that court ordered that the individual class actions be administratively closed in favor of the filing of consolidated class action complaints on behalf of customers and financial institutions allegedly harmed by the data breach in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses that we expect to incur in connection with the us customer class actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we agreed in principle to settlement terms that upon the approval of the district court will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the us customer class actions 

the accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the payment card networks’ claims and the us customer class actions are based on currently available information associated with those matters these estimates may change as new information becomes available or circumstances change 

other claims have been and may be asserted against us on behalf of customers payment card issuing banks shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising from the data breach in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 two  purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the district court against certain present and former members of our 

 18 

board of directors and executive officers we were also named as a nominal defendant in both suits which together assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets and violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 the two actions were consolidated into a single derivative complaint the complaint seeks unspecified damages equitable relief to reform our corporate governance structure restitution disgorgement of profits benefits and other compensation obtained by the defendants and reasonable costs and expenses in addition several state and federal agencies including state attorneys general are investigating events related to the data breach including how it occurred its consequences and our responses we are cooperating in the governmental investigations and we may be subject to fines or other obligations while a loss from these matters including the canadian class actions and the us financial institution class actions is reasonably possible we are not able to estimate the costs or range of costs related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages alleged damages have not been specified there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved we have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable therefore we have not recorded an accrual for litigation claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2015 we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

expenses incurred and amounts accrued 

in fiscal 2015  we recorded 198 million  of pretax gross expenses related to the data breach partially offset by 70 million  of expected insurance proceeds for pretax net expenses of 128 million  since the data breach occurred we have recorded 261 million  of pretax gross expenses related to the data breach partially offset by 100 million  of expected insurance proceeds for pretax net expenses of 161 million  these expenses include costs to investigate the data breach provide identity protection services including credit monitoring to impacted customers increase call center staffing and pay legal and other professional services all of which were expensed as incurred expenses also include the accruals for estimated probable losses that we have incurred or expect to incur in connection with the claims made by the payment card networks and the us customer class actions these expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 

future costs 

we expect to incur additional legal and other professional services expenses associated with the data breach in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received costs related to the data breach that may be incurred in future periods may include additional liabilities to payment card networks and impacted customers liabilities from current and future civil litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings future expenses for legal investigative and consulting fees and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2015  net cash provided by operating activities was  94 billion  compared to  82 billion  for fiscal 2014  this increase  was primarily due to a 664 million   increase  in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage and a 644 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses related to increased purchases and the timing of payments partially offset by a 422 million increase in merchandise inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2015  was  30 billion  compared to  13 billion  for fiscal 2014  this change was primarily due to 15 billion more in payments for businesses acquired net related to the acquisition of interline and 179 million less in proceeds from sales of investments in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 the aggregate purchase price of interline was 17 billion of which a portion was used for the repayment of substantially all of interline’s existing indebtedness see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of january 31 2016  amounts in millions 



  ————— 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at january 31 2016  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 90 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 10 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of january 31 2016  we had net of discounts  202 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of january 31 2016  was approximately  218 billion  

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately  80 billion  and  85 billion  of our revenue for fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

 26 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 71  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2015  or 2014  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers’ compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  we maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security this coverage is discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop 

 27 

allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years our most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2015  we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our us canada and mexico reporting units we performed qualitative assessments concluding that the fair value of our reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value there were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to 12 years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant there were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013

our business 

operating strategy   

over the past several years we have maintained a consistent strategic framework comprised of three key initiatives – customer service product authority and disciplined capital allocation productivity and efficiency – tied together through our interconnected retail initiative in fiscal 2014  we focused on continuing to enhance our capability to deliver a superior interconnected retail experience for our customers as customers increasingly expect to be able to buy how when and where they want we believe that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels featuring innovative and expanded product choices will be a key enabler for future success becoming a bestinclass interconnected retailer is growing in importance as the line between online and instore shopping continues to blur our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects the three other key initiatives of our longstanding strategic framework with the overall goal of strengthening the connectivity between our stores and our online channels and our connectivity with our customers 

our interconnected retail efforts are woven through each of our other three initiatives each of which is discussed in more detail below for example under our customer service initiative we strengthened connectivity in fiscal 2014  by rolling out the next generation of the first phone a handheld mobile customer service tool used by our store associates under our product authority initiative we continued to enhance our website and mobile sites which serve as an extended aisle of products product information and guidance on projects and services under our productivity and efficiency initiative we continued to optimize our supply chain capabilities to build connectivity among our delivery channels in fiscal 2014  we started a pilot for buy online deliver from store bodfs which complements our existing interconnected retail programs buy online pickup in store bopis buy online ship to store boss and buy online return in store boris 

customer service 

our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of simplifying the business creating an emotional connection with our customers putting customers first and taking care of our associates   our longstanding goal has been to remove complexity from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers and in fiscal 2014  we continued programs to reduce unnecessary store reports storebased emails and meetings that took away from the time store associates could spend on selling activities 

our customers  the home depot stores serve three primary customer groups and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs

loyalty program pro xtra that provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services exclusive product offers and a purchase tracking tool to enable receipt lookup online and job tracking of purchases across all forms of payment this program introduced in fiscal 2013 continued to gain traction with approximately 25 million customers enrolled by the end of fiscal 2014  

we help our diy difm and professional customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through thirdparty credit providers in fiscal 2014  our customers opened approximately 29 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at fiscal year end the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 11 million private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 23 of sales in fiscal 2014  

building connectivity  in fiscal 2014  we continued to enhance our customers interconnected shopping experiences through a variety of initiatives as noted above we completed the first major upgrade of our first phone instore mobile technology our new webenabled handheld devices which allow mobile checkout give our associates a simple customer service tool for locating products checking inventory on hand or simply explaining product features these capabilities are especially important for our interconnected customers many of our customers research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices or view our extended assortment our webenabled first phones help our associates assist with the online experience when they encounter customers in the aisles approximately 10 of our online orders were created from inside our stores in fiscal 2014  during fiscal 2014  we also introduced a new mobile app that provides an enhanced instore map and live chat feature and we have found that our customers are using this mobile app inside our stores 

we also recognize that customers desire greater visibility control and options when it comes to receiving their products and services in addition to our bopis boss and bodfs programs during fiscal 2014  we developed several delivery enhancements for our customers we began pilot programs to offer timespecific delivery of orders placed online or in the stores improve and simplify the instore experience for scheduling a delivery and enable customers to selfschedule a delivery on our website timespecific delivery capability will be particularly beneficial to our professional customers who need to ensure their orders are delivered to their job sites at the time that aligns with the project plan to avoid disruptions or delays 

we also made enhancements to our special order and installation process in fiscal 2014  first we introduced our new customer order management system which is being rolled out to all us stores this system is designed to provide greater visibility into and improved execution of special orders by our associates and a more seamless experience for our customers we also replaced our lead and purchase order management system with a single platform for our thirdparty installers in addition to the new interface installers have the option to integrate directly with our system through a secure data transmission this system improves communications between installers and the stores and delivers a better customer experience we also built better connectivity to reduce the time between a customers initial inquiry for service and the service providers contact with the customer which makes it more likely that the customer will proceed with the project 

our associates our associates are key to our customer service initiative we empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our customer first training program which includes enhanced training for our interconnected customers that stresses the importance of quick pickup of merchandise we also have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service at the end of fiscal 2014  we employed approximately 371000 associates of whom approximately 23000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we measure associate satisfaction regularly and we believe that our employee relations are very good

we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain highquality and innovative products directly from manufacturers around the world in fiscal 2014  in addition to our sourcing operations at our store support center in atlanta georgia we maintained seven sourcing offices located in shanghai china shenzhen china taipei taiwan gurgaon india rome italy monterrey mexico and toronto canada 

the percentage of net sales of each of our major product categories and related services for each of the last three fiscal years is presented in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements net sales outside the us were 85 billion  85 billion  and 84 billion  for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively longlived assets outside the us totaled 25 billion  29 billion  and 31 billion  as of february 1 2015  february 2 2014  and february 3 2013  respectively 

quality assurance  we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products whether they are directly imported locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products through these programs we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international federal state and local safety quality and performance standards we also have a supplier social and environmental responsibility program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility 

building connectivity  a typical the home depot store stocks approximately 30000  to 40000  products during the year including both national brand name and proprietary items to enhance our merchandising capabilities we continued to make improvements to our information technology tools in fiscal 2014  to give our merchants and suppliers greater visibility into category and item performance and to better assort products within stores with similar attributes based on local preferences regulations and demographics we also continued to use the resources of blacklocus inc a data analytics and pricing firm we acquired in fiscal 2012 to help us make focused merchandising decisions based on large complex data sets we also use these analytics at a storelevel to automate and optimize our markdown and clearance process 

as noted above our online properties complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our home depot home decorators collection and blindscom websites for our online user experience we continued to enhance our websites and mobile sites by improving navigation and search functionalities to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases for example through our bopis boss and bodfs programs and other delivery enhancements introduced in fiscal 2014 as a result of these efforts we increased traffic to our websites online sales conversion rates and the number of orders being picked up in our stores for fiscal 2014  we had over 12 billion visits to our online properties sales from our online channels increased over 36 compared to fiscal 2013 and almost 40 of our online orders were picked up in a store compared to approximately 30 in fiscal 2013 

energy saving products and programs the home depot has a longstanding commitment to sustainability as do many of our customers and we believe our efforts have been successful in creating value for our customers and shareholders for example we offer a growing selection of environmentallypreferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save money energy and water through our eco options ®  program introduced in 2007 we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency water conservation healthy home clean air and sustainable forestry as of the end of fiscal 2014  our eco options ®  program included over 9000 products through this program we sell products such as energy star ®  certified appliances compact fluorescent light cfl and led light bulbs tankless water heaters and other products enabling our customers to save on their utility bills we estimate that in fiscal 2014  we helped consumers save over 630 million in electricity costs through sales of energy star ®  certified products as well as almost 48 billion gallons of water and over 400 million in water bills through the sales of watersense ® labeled bath faucets showerheads aerators toilets and irrigation controllers additionally as a result of converting all of our consumer interior paints to low voc or zero voc in fiscal 2012 we have eliminated over 55 million pounds of volatile organic compound emissions since the beginning of fiscal 2012 through the end of fiscal 2014  

 4 

we also continue to use the eco options ®  page on our website to reach consumers interested in environmentally responsible and costsaving products and projects the site provides consumers with information on the benefits of environmentallypreferred eco options ®  products through green blogs articles and projects featured eco options ®  products and energy and water savings calculators to help consumers estimate potential savings by switching out their older less efficient products with energy and watersaving models 

we also support sustainability through our recycling efforts we continue to offer our nationwide instore cfl bulb recycling program launched in 2008 this service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all us stores we also maintain an instore rechargeable battery recycling program launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with call2recycle this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the us through these recycling programs in fiscal 2014  we helped recycle over 725000 pounds of cfl bulbs and over 940000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers in fiscal 2014  we also recycled over 107000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program as well as over 200000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our us stores we believe our eco options® programs and our recycling efforts drive sales which in turn benefits our shareholders in addition to our customers and the environment 

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our industry is highly competitive with competition based primarily on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business including our expanding proprietary brands such as hdx ®  husky ®  hampton bay ®  home decorators collection ®  glacier bay ®  and vigoro ®  we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

disciplined capital allocation productivity and efficiency 

we have advanced this initiative through building bestinclass competitive advantages in our information technology and supply chain to better ensure product availability to our customers while managing our costs during fiscal 2014  we continued to focus on optimizing our supply chain network and improving our inventory transportation and distribution productivity 

logistics our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers effectively using our investment in inventory and managing total supply chain costs our fiscal 2014  initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes by investing in information technology 

our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rapid deployment centers rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management we have 18 mechanized rdcs in the us and we opened our first rdc in canada in early 2014  with a second canadian rdc scheduled to open in the second half of fiscal 2015 we also continued our us transload program for imported products in four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports 

over the past several years we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and continuously improved our forecasting and replenishment technology this has helped us to improve our product availability and our 

 5 

inventory productivity at the same time at the end of fiscal 2014  over 95 of our us store products were ordered through central inventory management 

in addition to our rdcs and transload facilities at the end of fiscal 2014  we operated 34 bulk distribution centers which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks in the us and canada 21 stocking distribution centers in the us canada and mexico and ten specialty distribution centers which include offshore consolidation and return logistics centers in the us and canada we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network for example we have begun to flow a portion of our boss orders through our rdcs which reduces our transportation costs for those orders 

building connectivity we also believe that using our almost 2000 us stores as a network of convenient locations for our customers who shop online and use our bopis boss and boris programs provides us with a competitive advantage as noted above in fiscal 2014  we started a pilot for bodfs which will give us the capability to deliver orders placed online from our stores to the customers home or job site in addition we added capacity for the more traditional online directtocustomer delivery methods in fiscal 2014  we opened two new direct fulfillment centers in georgia and california which brings our total to four direct fulfillment center operations in the us and another facility is scheduled to open in the second half of fiscal 2015 these facilities will support our online growth with a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers needs we expect these facilities to provide us the capability to deliver 90 of our customers parcel orders in the us within two days 

commitment to environmentally responsible operations  the home depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain store construction and maintenance and as noted above under energy saving products and programs product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers 

in fiscal 2014  our energy management team continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our us facilities these include hvac unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency we estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs we have saved over 86 billion kilowatt hours kwh since 2004 we set a goal to reduce our kwh per square foot in our us stores by 20 by 2015 we met that goal in fiscal 2013 well in advance of our targeted date and estimate a reduction of almost 32 as of the end of fiscal 2014  

through our supply chain efficiencies described above under logistics we targeted a 20 reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015 we also continued to monitor our carbon footprint from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities through our supply chain and energy reduction initiatives we have exceeded our goal by reducing our absolute carbon emissions by over 19 million metric tons from 2008 to 2013 including the reduction of over 125000 metric tons in 2013 

at our stores we implemented a rainwater reclamation project in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2014  we had retrofitted 150 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers we estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500000 gallons per retrofitted store in fiscal 2014  

our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions for example in 2014 we received three significant awards from the us environmental protection agency epa we were named retail partner of the year by both the energy star ®  division and watersense ®  division of the epa for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and water efficiency and we received the epas smartway excellence award which recognizes the home depot as an industry leader in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency we also participate in the cdp formerly known as the carbon disclosure project reporting process cdp is an independent international notforprofit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure disclose manage and share environmental information in 2014 we scored 93 out of 100 from the cdp for our disclosure placing us among the highest scoring retailers and in the top quartile of our sector we also received a performance band ranking of a out of a range from a to e reflecting a high level of action on climate change mitigation adaptation and transparency 

we are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven 

 6 

into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

returning value to shareholders  in addition to making disciplined decisions about capital allocation we maintained our focus on expense control which drove higher returns on invested capital and allowed us to return value to shareholders through 70 billion in share repurchases and 25 billion in dividends in fiscal 2014 as discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers some of whom have a lower cost structure than ours as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining high levels of customer service it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as the housing and home improvement market continues to recover resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels in addition each of our primary customer groups – diy difm and professionals – have different needs and expectations if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also evolving customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process we have implemented programs like boss and bopis and are piloting bodfs but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers’ needs and expectations customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation 

 7 

further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping environment that our customers desire failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively to provide a compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs and to differentiate the customer service experience for our three primary customer groups could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations minimum wage or healthcare benefits in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunities increase there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

we discovered a data breach in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and are still in the process of determining the full extent of its impact and the impact of related government investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations which could be material 

our recent data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems as a result of the data breach we are facing at least 57 civil lawsuits filed in the us and canada and other claims may be asserted on behalf of customers payment card brands payment card issuing banks shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach we are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies our financial liability arising from these claims and investigations will depend on many factors one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards another factor is whether and if so to what extent any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders the payment card networks or the card issuing banks on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the data breach can be properly attributed to the data breach and whether and to what extent those losses and expenses would in any event be our legal responsibility 

these claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business divert the attention of management from the operation of the business and result in additional costs and fines in addition the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief which could materially increase our data security costs adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers 

investigations of the data breach are ongoing and we are still in the process of assessing the financial and other impacts of the data breach it is possible that we will identify additional information that was accessed or stolen or other unforeseen developments related to the data breach could occur which could have a further adverse impact on our operations financial results and reputation 

if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier or company information are not successful we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to further litigation enforcement actions and reputational damage 

our business like that of most retailers involves the receipt storage and transmission of customers personal information consumer preferences and payment card information as well as confidential information about our associates our suppliers and our company some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors we also work with thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates thirdparty service providers or vendors hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to 

 8 

obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data any future significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of customer associate supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost sales fines and lawsuits and damage to our reputation in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards paypal our private label credit cards and installment loan program and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted making compliance more difficult or costly the payment card industry has set october 1 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept emv chip card credit and debit transactions to be able to accept all forms of emv card transactions by the target date we are reliant on various third parties to establish the standard for such transactions develop and test the required software define the applicable certification standards and certify compliance with those standards the failure of these third parties to timely complete and deliver needed elements or our failure to effectively and timely implement those elements once received will impact our ability to be able to accept all types of emv card transactions by the target date which could in turn result in increased costs associated with the liability shift for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems as reflected in our recent data breach if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept or if paymentrelated data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired in addition our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs as a result our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

uncertainty regarding economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors beyond our control – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to analyze process manage and protect transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business for these systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures 

 9 

computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes or hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems we may not be successful in doing so as a result we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability military conflict the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates any disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks 

as we expand our proprietary product offerings we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design manufacture marketing and sale of those products including greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements and increased potential product liability and product recall exposure to effectively 

 10 

execute on our product differentiation strategy we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties in addition an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors products which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and reputational damage 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations cybersecurity and data privacy the sale of some of our products transportation logistics supply chain transparency taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations in addition recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our sales and profit margins 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins

speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings data 

for the fiscal year ended february 1 2015  fiscal 2014  we reported net earnings of  63 billion  and diluted earnings per share of  471  compared to net earnings of  54 billion  and diluted earnings per share of  376  for the fiscal year ended february 2 2014  fiscal 2013  the results for fiscal 2014 included 33 million  of pretax net expenses related to a breach of our payment data systems the data breach the results for fiscal 2014 also included a 323 million  pretax gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply holdings inc hd supply 

net sales increased 55  to  832 billion  for fiscal 2014  from  788 billion  for fiscal 2013  our total comparable store sales increased 53  in fiscal 2014  driven by a 35 increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 18 increase in our comparable store average ticket comparable store sales for our us stores increased 61 in fiscal 2014  

data breach 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at selfcheckout systems in our us and canadian stores our investigation to date has determined the intruder used a vendor’s user name and password to enter the perimeter of our network the intruder then acquired elevated rights that allowed it to navigate portions of our systems and to deploy unique custombuilt malware on our selfcheckout systems to access payment card information of up to 56 million customers who shopped at our us and canadian stores between april 2014 and september 2014 on september 18 2014 we confirmed that the malware used in the data breach had been eliminated from our systems there is no evidence that debit pin numbers were compromised or that the data breach impacted stores in mexico or customers who shopped online at homedepotcom or homedepotca in addition we announced on november 6 2014 that separate files containing approximately 53 million email addresses were also taken during the data breach these files did not contain passwords payment card information or other sensitive personal information the investigation of the data breach is ongoing and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties 

in september 2014 we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our us stores offering significant new protection for customers the new security protection takes raw payment card information and scrambles it to make it unreadable to unauthorized users we are also rolling out enhanced encryption to our canadian stores and emv chipandpin technology in our us stores which will add extra layers of payment card protection for customers who use emv enabled chipandpin cards our canadian stores are already enabled with emv chipandpin technology 

expenses incurred 

in fiscal 2014 we recorded 63 million  of pretax expenses related to the data breach partially offset by 30 million  of expected insurance proceeds for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage for pretax net expenses of 33 million  these expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2014 expenses include costs to investigate the data breach provide identity protection services including credit monitoring to impacted customers increase call center staffing and pay legal and other professional services all of which were expensed as incurred 

litigation claims and government investigations 

in addition to the above expenses we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us the ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and nonordinary course operating expenses such as card reissuance costs that the payment card networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred in order for us to have liability for such claims we believe it would have to be determined among other things that 1 at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards and 2 the alleged noncompliance caused at least some portion of the compromise of payment card data that occurred during the data breach although an independent thirdparty assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013 and the process of obtaining such certification for 2014 was ongoing at the time of the data breach in march 2015 the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks alleged that we were not in compliance with certain of those standards at the time of the data breach as a result we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us and that we will dispute those claims when those claims are asserted we will have to determine based on the facts and information then available to us whether to litigate or seek to settle those claims at this time we believe that settlement negotiations will ensue and that it is probable that we will incur a loss in connection with those claims we cannot 

 18 

reasonably estimate a range of losses because no claims have yet been asserted and because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

in addition at least 57  actions have been filed in courts in the us and canada and other claims may be asserted against us on behalf of customers payment card brands payment card issuing banks shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising from the data breach furthermore several state and federal agencies including state attorneys general are investigating events related to the data breach including how it occurred its consequences and our responses we are cooperating in the governmental investigations and we may be subject to fines or other obligations while a loss from these matters is reasonably possible we are not able to estimate the costs or range of costs related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages alleged damages have not been specified there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved we have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable therefore we have not recorded an accrual for litigation claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in fiscal 2014 we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations could be material to our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

future costs 

we expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the data breach in future periods we will recognize these expenses as services are received costs related to the data breach that may be incurred in future periods may also include liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs liabilities related to our private label credit card fraud and card reissuance costs liabilities from current and future civil litigation governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings future expenses for legal investigative and consulting fees and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance coverage 

we maintained 100 million  of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014 above a 75 million  deductible to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data breach as of february 1 2015  we had received an initial payment of 10 million  of insurance reimbursements in fiscal 2015 we entered into a new policy with 100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage above a 10 million deductible to limit our exposure to similar losses

interconnected retail  – our focus on interconnected retail which connects our other three key initiatives is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels in fiscal 2014  we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience resulting in increased traffic to our websites increased online sales conversion rates and an increase in the number of orders being picked up in our stores almost 40 of our online orders are picked up in our stores through our buy online pickup in store bopis and buy online ship to store boss programs additionally we improved navigation enhanced search capabilities and expanded chat functionality across our online platforms sales from our online channels increased 369 for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  and represented approximately 45  of our total net sales for fiscal 2014

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february 1 2015  amounts in millions 



  ————— 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at february 1 2015  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 90 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 10 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of february 1 2015  we had net of discounts  162 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of february 1 2015  was approximately  190 billion  

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately 85 billion of our revenue in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely 

 26 

impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 74  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2014  or 2013  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  we maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security this coverage is discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location 

 27 

before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business as well as for the china store closings in fiscal 2012 which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years our most recent quantitative assessment was completed in fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2014 we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our us canada and mexico reporting units we performed qualitative assessments concluding that the fair value of our reporting units was not more likely than not less than the carrying value in fiscal 2012 we recorded a charge of 97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former china reporting unit there were no impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to ten years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant there were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu no 201409 which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu no 201409 supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and early application is not permitted the guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company is evaluating the effect that asu no 201409 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our industry is highly competitive with competition based primarily on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business including our expanding proprietary brands such as hdx ®  husky ®  hampton bay ®  home decorators collection ®  glacier bay ®  and vigoro ®  we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

disciplined capital allocation productivity and efficiency 

logistics our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers effectively using our investment in inventory and managing total supply chain costs our fiscal 2013  initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes by investing in information technology 

our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rapid deployment centers rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management we have 18 fully mechanized rdcs in the us and we opened our first rdc in canada in early 2014 with a second canadian rdc under development we also continued our us transload program for imported products in four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by postponing final inventory deployment decisions until product arrives at destination ports 

over the past several years we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and implemented new forecasting and replenishment technology this has helped us to improve our instock rates and our inventory productivity at the same time at the end of fiscal 2013  over 95 of our us store products were ordered through central inventory management 

in addition to our 18 rdcs in the us at the end of fiscal 2013  we operated 34 bulk distribution centers which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks in the us and canada we also operated 36 conventional distribution centers which include stocking direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers in the us canada and mexico in 

 5 

february 2014 to support directtocustomer delivery we opened a new direct fulfillment center in the us and we plan to add two additional facilities by the end of 2015 we expect these facilities to provide us the ability to deliver 90 of our customers parcel orders in the us within two days we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network 

commitment to environmentally responsible operations  the home depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain store construction and maintenance and as noted above under energy saving products and programs product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers 

in fiscal 2013  our energy management team continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our us facilities these include hvac unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency we estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs we have saved almost 70 billion kilowatt hours kwh since 2004 that year we set a goal to reduce our kwh per square foot in our us stores by 20 by 2015 and we met that goal in fiscal 2013 well in advance of our targeted date 

through our supply chain efficiencies described above under logistics we are targeting a 20 reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015 which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons we also continued to monitor our carbon footprint from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives we estimate that we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 216000 metric tons in 2012 compared to 2011 

with respect to construction of our stores we partnered with the us green building council and as of the end of fiscal 2013 have built eight leed for new construction certified or similarly certified stores in 2012 we opened a new store in lodi california and used a grant from the us department of energy to help design monitor and verify the energy savings at that store the building is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 901 ashrae standards established by the american society of heating refrigerating and airconditioning engineers an international society that sets forth hvac and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability we also implemented a rainwater reclamation project in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2013 we had retrofitted 122 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers we estimate our annual water savings from these units to be approximately 500000 gallons per retrofitted store in fiscal 2013 

our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions for example in 2013 we were named retail partner of the year by both the energy star ®  division and watersense ®  division of the us environmental protection agency for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and water efficiency we also scored 99 out of 100 on the carbon disclosure project climate disclosure index placing us among the highest scoring companies in the index and at the top of our sector 

we are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

interconnected retail 

our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives and it is growing in importance as the line between online and instore shopping continues to blur over 30 of our online orders are picked up in a store and many of our customers research products online and then go into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate before making the purchase while in the store customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews compare prices or view our extended assortment and over 10 of our online orders are created instore with a store associate assisting the customer providing a seamless multichannel retail experience is key to helping our customers buy when how 

 6 

and where they want throughout fiscal 2013 we continued to invest in our website to allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases for example through our bopis boris and boss programs through our website which can be accessed through computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices customers can share reviews purchase products track their installation projects and connect with our associates to gain product and project knowledge to increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates merchants and suppliers and ensure that the right product is in the right place to meet our customers needs we also continued to invest in the development of our distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing inventory levels it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand recovery in the housing and home improvement market puts further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels in addition we must continually anticipate and adapt to the increasing use of technology and mobile devices by our customers in the purchasing process customers are able to use technology to rapidly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media it may impact our brand and reputation further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance to deliver the shopping environment our customers desire failure to maintain our stores and an effective online presence and to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction 

 7 

these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

uncertainty regarding economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors beyond our control – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier or company information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

our business involves the storage and transmission of customers personal information consumer preferences and credit card information as well as confidential information about our associates our suppliers and our company our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security whether external or internal or misuse of associate or customer data could significantly damage our reputation cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information and result in significant costs lost sales fines and lawsuits while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to analyze process and manage transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business in order for these systems and processes to operate effectively we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates supply disruptions weather conditions natural disasters shipping interruptions or costs and other factors beyond our control 

 8 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation which may impact our sales and gross margin results 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network including damage or destruction to our distribution centers or weatherrelated events could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and damaged reputation 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations the sale of some of our products transportation logistics supply chain transparency taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints as 

 9 

well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

net sales 

fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2012 net sales for fiscal 2013   increased   54  to 788 billion  from 748 billion  for fiscal 2012  the increase  in net sales for fiscal 2013  reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 partially offset by 12 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012 total comparable store sales increased 68  for fiscal 2013  compared to an increase of 46  for fiscal 2012  

the positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013  reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives continued strength in our core categories and an improved us housing market all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013  comparable store sales for our kitchen electrical lumber plumbing lighting bath and indoor garden product categories were above or at the company average for fiscal 2013  comparable store sales for our tools paint flooring décor hardware outdoor garden millwork and building materials product categories were positive for fiscal 2013  further our comparable store customer transactions increased approximately 34 for fiscal 2013 and comparable store average ticket increased approximately 33 for fiscal 2013  due in part to strong sales in our appliance business and continued recovery in sales to our professional customers 

gross profit 

gross profit increased   60  to 274 billion  for fiscal 2013  from 258 billion  for fiscal 2012  gross profit for fiscal 2012 included a 10 million charge related to the china store closings gross profit as a percent of net sales was 348  for fiscal 2013  compared to 346  for fiscal 2012  an increase  of 18 basis points the increase  in gross profit margin in fiscal 2013  was driven primarily by businesses we acquired in fiscal 2012 which are gross margin accretive higher productivity in our supply chain and improved shrink performance partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased   05  to 166 billion  for fiscal 2013  from 165 billion  for fiscal 2012  sga for fiscal 2012 included a 135 million charge related to the china store closings as a percent of net sales sga was 211  for fiscal 2013  compared to 221  for fiscal 2012  the decrease  in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2013  reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls 

depreciation and amortization was 16 billion  for both fiscal 2013  and 2012  depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 21  for both fiscal 2013  and 2012  

operating income 

operating income increased   180  to 92 billion  for fiscal 2013  from 78 billion  for fiscal 2012  operating income as a percent of net sales was 116  for fiscal 2013  compared to 104  for fiscal 2012  

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2013  we recognized 699 million  of interest and other net compared to 545 million  for fiscal 2012  interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 09  for fiscal 2013  compared to 07  for fiscal 2012  the increase  in interest and other net as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2013 reflects increased interest expense associated with the issuance of 40 billion of incremental longterm debt in fiscal 2013 interest and other net for fiscal 2012 included a 67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply inc 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate was 364  for fiscal 2013  compared to 372  for fiscal 2012  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2013 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the 145 million charge related to the china store closings for fiscal 2012 excluding the charge related to the china store closings our combined effective income tax rate was 365 for fiscal 2012 

 20 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 376  for fiscal 2013  compared to 300  for fiscal 2012  excluding the charge related to the china store closings diluted earnings per share were 310 for fiscal 2012  the 53 rd  week increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 007 for fiscal 2012 

nongaap measures 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance we supplement our reporting to exclude from some gaap measures certain items that we do not consider to be representative of our actual operating performance these financial calculations are nongaap financial measures as defined in sec rules we believe these nongaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

the results for fiscal 2012 included a 145 million charge net of tax related to the china store closings as described more fully in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements there were no adjustments for fiscal 2013 or 2011 for events of unusual nature or frequency the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for fiscal 2012 amounts in millions except per share data   



fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011 

net sales 

fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 net sales for fiscal 2012 increased 62 to 748 billion from 704 billion for fiscal 2011 the increase in net sales for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and 12 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012 total comparable store sales increased 46 for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 34 for fiscal 2011 

the positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved us housing market all of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 and comparable store average ticket increased 29 for fiscal 2012 comparable store sales for our lumber flooring paint tools bath electrical lighting indoor garden and décor product categories were above or at the company average for fiscal 2012 comparable store sales for our hardware plumbing outdoor garden kitchen and millwork product categories were positive for fiscal 2012 comparable store sales for our building materials product category were negative for fiscal 2012 reflecting the impact of weather and difficult yearoveryear comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in fiscal 2011

operating expenses 

sga increased 30 to 165 billion for fiscal 2012 from 160 billion for fiscal 2011 sga for fiscal 2012 included a 135 million charge related to the china store closings as a percent of net sales sga was 221 for fiscal 2012 compared to 228 for fiscal 2011 excluding the charge related to the china store closings sga as a percent of net sales was 219 for fiscal 2012 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage 

 21 

resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment strong expense controls and lower credit card expense and casualty reserves offset by the charge related to the china store closings 

depreciation and amortization was 16 billion for both fiscal 2012 and 2011 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 21 for fiscal 2012 compared to 22 for fiscal 2011 the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 300 for fiscal 2012 compared to 247 for fiscal 2011 excluding the charge related to the china store closings diluted earnings per share were 310 for fiscal 2012 the 53 rd  week increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 007 for fiscal 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2013  net cash provided by operating activities was  76 billion  compared to  70 billion  for fiscal 2012  this increase  is primarily due to an 850 million   increase  in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2013  was  15 billion  compared to  14 billion  for fiscal 2012  this change was primarily due to a 77 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2013  was  67 billion  compared to  50 billion  for fiscal 2012  the yearoveryear increase of approximately 17 billion reflects a 46 billion increase in share repurchases a 500 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders and 543 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock offset for the most part by 40 billion net of repayments of proceeds from longterm borrowings in fiscal 2013 

in february 2013 our board of directors authorized a new 170 billion share repurchase program under which we have repurchased 111 million  shares of our common stock for a total of 85 billion  as of the end of fiscal 2013  we entered into asr agreements with thirdparty financial institutions to repurchase 62 billion  of our common stock in fiscal 2013  under the agreements we paid 62 billion  to the financial institutions and received a total of 81 million  shares also in fiscal 2013  we repurchased 30 million  additional shares of our common stock for 23 billion  through the open market 

in september 2013 we issued 115 billion  of 225  senior notes due september 10 2018  the 2018 notes” at a discount of 1 million  11 billion  of 375  senior notes due february 15 2024  the 2024 notes” at a discount of 6 million  and 10 billion  of 4875  senior notes due february 15 2044  the 2044 notes” at a discount of 15 million  together the september 2013 issuance interest on the 2018 notes is due semiannually on march 10 and september 10  of each year beginning march 10 2014 interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semiannually on february 15 and august 15  of each year beginning february 15 2014 the net proceeds of the september 2013 issuance were used for general corporate 

 22 

purposes including repayment of our 125 billion   525  senior notes that matured december 16 2013  and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

in april 2013 we issued 10 billion  of 270  senior notes due april 1 2023  at a discount of 2 million  and 10 billion  of 420  senior notes due april 1 2043  at a discount of 4 million  together the april 2013 issuance interest on these senior notes is due semiannually on april 1 and october 1  of each year beginning october 1 2013 the net proceeds of the april 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares of our common stock 

in november 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 10 2018  with a notional amount of 500 million  accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on the 2018 notes for variable interest equal to libor plus 88 basis points at february 2 2014 the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of 1 million  which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement 

also in november 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 15 2020  with a notional amount of 500 million  accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 395  senior notes due september 15 2020  for variable interest equal to libor plus 183 basis points at february 2 2014 the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 2 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 

at february 2 2014 we had an outstanding interest rate swap that expires on march 1 2016  with a notional amount of 500 million  accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 540  senior notes due march 1 2016  for variable interest equal to libor plus 300 basis points at february 2 2014 the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 28 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 20 billion  in connection with the programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion  the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants at february 2 2014  we were in compliance with all of the covenants and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources as of february 2 2014  there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current installments of longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

in connection with the sale of hd supply on august 30 2007 we guaranteed a 10 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of hd supply the original expiration date of the guarantee was august 30 2012 in march 2010 we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to april 1 2014 the fair value of the guarantee at august 30 2007 was 16 million and was recorded as a liability in other longterm liabilities the extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to 67 million resulting in a 51 million charge to interest and other net for fiscal 2010 in april 2012 the term loan guarantee was terminated as a result we reversed the 67 million liability related to the guarantee resulting in a 67 million pretax benefit to interest and other net for fiscal 2012 

as of february 2 2014  we had  19 billion  in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

in march 2014 we entered into an asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 950 million  of our common stock under the agreement we paid 950 million  to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million  shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the asr agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february 2 2014  amounts in millions 



  ————— 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at february 2 2014  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 89 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 11 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of february 2 2014  we had net of discounts  142 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of february 2 2014  was approximately  156 billion  

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated 

 24 

balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 74  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2013  or 2012  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including product liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

 25 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business as well as for the china store closings in fiscal 2012 which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years in fiscal 2013  we elected to estimate the fair values of our identified reporting units using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition inflation and discount rates a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units would not result in an impairment a 10 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also not result in an impairment 

the reporting units assessed for impairment during fiscal 2013 were us canada and mexico during fiscal 2013  we determined that our goodwill balances for each of these reporting units were not impaired as we determined the fair value for each of these reporting units was substantially above its carrying value in fiscal 2012 we recorded a charge of 97 million  to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former china reporting unit there were no impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to ten years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant there were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011

 customer service   

our customers  the home depot stores serve three primary customer groups and we have different customer service approaches to meet their particular needs 

 in fiscal 2012  we undertook a number of projects and new developments to enhance our customers shopping experiences in addition to retraining our associates on the customers first program we rolled out the first phone junior to all of our 

 2 

stores this version combines the communication features of a phone with the product and inventory lookup features of our first phone but without its complex business analytics and product ordering features we can now spread the basic functionality and customer service benefits of the first phone throughout the store at a lower cost we also implemented a new store to store feature which allows our associates to look up inventory in other stores reserve the inventory and complete the sales transaction for the customer we continued to take tasking out of the stores so that our associates can focus on assisting customers to improve our labor efficiency we have developed tools for automated inaisle inventory management to replace our former manual paperdriven processes as of the end of fiscal 2012  approximately 57 of our store labor hours were dedicated to customerfacing activity with a goal of reaching 60 by the end of fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2012 we continued to automate our special order and installation process to improve transparency and communication and to simplify the customer experience and we launched myinstall on our website which allows our customers to schedule appointments and track their projects online our recent strategic acquisitions are also aimed at improving our customers home improvement experiences red beacon acquired at the end of fiscal 2011 is a website that helps our difm customers find professionals to help them complete home improvement projects this acquisition enables us to deliver on consumer expectations by making it easier to get these projects done it allows us to help our professional customers find jobs and it builds relationships with our customers we also acquired two companies that provided services to our customers – a flooring measurement company and a kitchen and bath refacing company these acquisitions enable us to strengthen and unify our customers home services experience under the home depot brand 

we help our professional diy and difm customers finance their projects by offering private label credit products in our stores through thirdparty credit providers in fiscal 2012  our customers opened approximately 25 million new the home depot private label credit accounts and at fiscal year end the total number of the home depot active account holders was approximately 10 million private label credit card sales accounted for approximately 22 of sales in fiscal 2012  in addition to improve customer convenience at the register we completed our rollout of paypal ®  as an instore payment option and in certain stores implemented a program for customers to receive an electronic copy of their receipt 

our associates our associates are key to our customer service initiative we empower our associates to deliver excellent customer service through our customers first training program and we have a number of companysponsored programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer and community service at the end of fiscal 2012  we employed approximately 340000 associates of whom approximately 21000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve we measure associate satisfaction regularly and maintain multiple means of ensuring effective communications with our associates we believe that our employee relations are very good

 3 

from our store support center we maintain a global sourcing program to obtain highquality products directly from manufacturers around the world our merchant team identifies and purchases innovative products directly for our stores additionally we have three sourcing offices located in the chinese cities of shanghai shenzhen and dalian as well as sourcing offices in gurgaon india rome italy monterrey mexico and toronto canada 

quality assurance  we have both quality assurance and engineering resources that are dedicated to overseeing the quality of all of our products whether they are directly imported locally or globally sourced or proprietary branded products through these programs we have established criteria for supplier and product performance that are designed to ensure that our products comply with applicable international federal state and local safety quality and performance standards we also have a supplier social and environmental responsibility program designed to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility 

energy saving products and programs   as an industry leader the home depot is committed to doing the right thing for our customers and the environment by providing consumers a selection of environmentally preferred products that help them save money energy and water we are helping to ensure a more sustainable future through our eco options ®  program introduced in 2007 we have created product categories that allow consumers to easily identify products that meet specifications for energy efficiency water conservation healthy home clean air and sustainable forestry as of the end of fiscal 2012 our eco options ®  program has certified over 5000 products through this program we sell products such as energy star ®  refrigerators dishwashers compact fluorescent light cfl bulbs ecosmart ®  led light bulbs programmable thermostats tankless on demand water heaters and other products enabling our customers to save on their utility bills led light bulbs which use approximately 85 less energy and last up to 20 years longer than traditional incandescent bulbs continued to be one of our fastest growing categories for the year we estimate that in fiscal 2012 sales of energy star ®  qualified products helped consumers save over 700 million in annual utility costs we also helped our customers save water through sales of watersense ® labeled bath faucets showerheads aerators and toilets through the sales of these products we estimate that we have helped consumers save over 30 billion gallons of water and over 200 million in water bills 

in fiscal 2012 we made extensive updates to the eco options ®  page on our website to enable us to address growing customer demand for environmentally responsible and costsaving products and projects the newly enhanced site increases consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of various products provides educational tips and identifies green projects the site also helps consumers identify products included in the eco options ®  program and it now includes a calculator to enable consumers to determine energy and water savings achievable by making small changes in their homes 

in partnership with the us green building council we launched a website in fiscal 2012 to help our customers easily identify products with potential leadership in energy and environmental design leed point values at the end of fiscal 2012  we had approximately 3500 leed for homes products sold in our stores and online the website found at wwwleedhomedepotcom is designed to simplify the complexities of building green and arm our customers with the tools needed to navigate the leed for homes programs by providing tips informative videos and educational content 

we continue to offer our nationwide instore cfl bulb recycling program launched in 2008 this service is offered to customers free of charge and is available in all us stores we also maintain an instore rechargeable battery recycling program launched in 2001 and currently done in partnership with call2recycle this program is also available to customers free of charge in all stores throughout the us through these recycling programs in fiscal 2012  we helped recycle over 600000 pounds of cfl bulbs and over 852000 pounds of rechargeable batteries collected from our customers in fiscal 2012  we also recycled over 98000 lead acid batteries collected from our customers under our lead acid battery exchange program as well as approximately 173000 tons of cardboard through a nationwide cardboard recycling program across our us stores 

 4 

net sales of major product groups  the following table shows the percentage of net sales of each major product group and related services for each of the last three fiscal years 



net sales outside the us were 84 billion  80 billion  and 75 billion  for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively longlived assets outside the us totaled 31 billion  31 billion  and 32 billion  as of february 3 2013  january 29 2012  and january 30 2011  respectively 

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter fiscal 2012 included 53 weeks rather than 52 weeks as a result our fourth fiscal quarter in 2012 included an extra week which increased sales for that quarter 

competition our industry is highly competitive with competition based primarily on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

disciplined capital allocation productivity and efficiency 

logistics our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers effectively using our investment in inventory and managing total supply chain costs our fiscal 2012  initiatives have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes 

our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management to enhance our rdc network we continued adding mechanization and at the end of fiscal 2012  all 18 of our us rdcs were mechanized we also expanded our us transload program for imported products to four facilities operated by third parties near ocean ports transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by enabling imported product to flow through our rdc network 

over the past several years we have centralized our inventory planning and replenishment function and implemented new forecasting and replenishment technology this has helped us to improve our instock rates and our inventory productivity at the same time at the end of fiscal 2012  over 91 of our us store products were ordered through central replenishment 

in addition to our 18 rdcs in the us at the end of fiscal 2012  we operated 33 bulk distribution centers which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks in the us and canada we also operated 36 conventional distribution centers which include stocking direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers in the us canada and mexico we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network 

 5 

commitment to environmentally responsible operations  the home depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain store construction and maintenance and as noted above under energy saving products and programs product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers 

in fiscal 2012  we continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our us facilities these include hvac unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency we estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs we have saved over 55 billion kilowatt hours kwh since 2004 and we are on track to meet our goal of a 20 reduction in kwh per square foot in our us stores by 2015 

through our supply chain efficiencies described above under logistics we are targeting a 20 reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015 which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons we also continued to monitor our carbon footprint from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 777000 metric tons in 2011 compared to 2010 

with respect to construction of our stores we partnered with the us green building council and have built seven leed for new construction certified or similarly certified stores in 2012 we opened a new store in lodi california and used a grant from the us department of energy to help design monitor and verify the energy savings at that store the building is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 901 ashrae standards established by the american society of heating refrigerating and airconditioning engineers an international society that sets forth hvac and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability we also implemented a rainwater reclamation pilot in 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2012 we have retrofitted 81 of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers in september 2011 we opened a store in st croix in the us virgin islands with both ground mount and roof mount solar panel systems and we estimate the combined total annual energy production of these systems to be over 580 megawatt hours 

our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions for example in 2012 we were named retail partner of the year by the energy star ®  division of the us environmental protection agency the epa for our overall excellence in energy efficiency and we received the epas watersense ® 2012 associate education excellence award we were also recognized as a high performer by the carbon disclosure project 

we are strongly committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with varying degrees of training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

interconnected retail 

our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives in fiscal 2012 we focused on leveraging technology to improve our customers retail experience and provide better access to and information about our products as described above these efforts included information technology solutions that take tasks out of the store and free our associates to devote more time to customerfacing activities they also included significant website enhancements that allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide them with flexibility and convenience for their purchases for example through our bopis boris boss and store to store programs through our website which can be accessed through computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices customers can purchase products and track their installation projects through myinstall and can connect with our associates and with one another to gain product and project knowledge in areas that are important to them for example in fiscal 2012 we updated the eco options ®  page on our website to provide more information for our environmentallyminded customers and we had convenience in mind when we introduced a mobile application that allows our customers to select and purchase products quickly furthermore to increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates merchants and suppliers and ensure that 

 6 

the right product is in the right place to meet our customers needs we continued to develop our distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers tablets smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing inventory levels further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance to deliver the shopping environment our customers desire failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

 7 

we rely on third party suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates supply disruptions shipping interruptions or costs and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation 

if we do not maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information and result in significant costs lost sales fines and lawsuits while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to analyze process and manage transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

 8 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network including damage or destruction to our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines lawsuits and damaged reputation 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations the sale of some of our products transportation logistics taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law compliance challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

 9 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

depreciation and amortization was 16 billion  for both fiscal 2012  and 2011  depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 21  for fiscal 2012  compared to 22  for fiscal 2011  the decrease  in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment

 20 

the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 300  for fiscal 2012  compared to 247  for fiscal 2011  excluding the charges related to the china store closings diluted earnings per share were 310 for fiscal 2012  the 53 rd  week increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 007 for fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 also reflect 011 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended february 3 2013

in march 2011 we issued 10 billion of 440 senior notes due april 1 2021 at a discount of 2 million and 10 billion of 595 senior notes due april 1 2041 at a discount of 4 million together the march 2011 issuance interest on these senior notes is due semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning october 1 2011 the net proceeds of the march 2011 issuance were used to repurchase 10 billion of our common stock and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 520 senior notes that matured march 1 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of 10 billion

in march 2011 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on march 1 2016 with a notional amount of 500 million accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 540 senior notes due march 1 2016 for variable interest equal to libor plus 300 basis points at february 3 2013  the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 36 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 

also at february 3 2013  we had outstanding interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges that expire on december 16 2013 with a notional amount of 125 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our 125 billion 525 senior notes due december 16 2013 for variable interest equal to libor plus 259 basis points at february 3 2013  the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of 28 million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements

in connection with the sale of hd supply on august 30 2007 we guaranteed a 10 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of hd supply the original expiration date of the guarantee was august 30 2012 in march 2010 we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to april 1 2014 the fair value of the guarantee at august 30 2007 was 16 million and was recorded as a liability in other longterm liabilities the extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to 67 million resulting in a 51 million charge to interest and other net for fiscal 2010 in april 2012 the term loan guarantee was terminated as a result we reversed the 67 million liability related to the guarantee resulting in a 67 million pretax benefit to interest and other net for fiscal 2012 

as of february 3 2013  we had  25 billion  in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

in march 2013  we entered into an asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 15 billion  of our common stock under the agreement we will pay 15 billion  to the financial institution using cash on hand and receive an initial delivery of approximately 18 million  shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the asr agreement

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february 3 2013  amounts in millions 



  ————— 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at february 3 2013  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 82 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 18 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

as of february 3 2013  we had net of discounts  103 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of february 3 2013  was approximately  122 billion  

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated 

 24 

balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 76  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2012  or 2011  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

selfinsurance 

we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including products liability workers’ compensation employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are selfinsured our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable for each claim involving general liability workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to 25 million 1 million and 1 million respectively we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured employee group medical claims our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the liabilities are reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

 25 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business as well as for the china store closings in fiscal 2012 which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments during fiscal 2012  for all reporting units other than our china reporting unit we used qualitative factors to determine that our goodwill balances for each reporting unit were not impaired for our china reporting unit we recorded a charge of 97 million to impair all of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit in fiscal 2012  impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill were not material for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to ten years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant impairment charges related to our other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 asu no 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income under asu no 201105 an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter and retrospective application was required this guidance impacted the presentation of our consolidated financial statements

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal influences generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our business is highly competitive based primarily on customer service price store location and assortment of merchandise although we are currently the world’s largest home improvement retailer in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers 

intellectual property our business has one of the most recognized brands in north america as a result we believe that the home depot ®  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products ecommerce stores and business we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks service marks copyrights and internet domain names both domestically and internationally for use in our business we also maintain patent portfolios relating to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our products or business operations 

productivity and efficiency 

logistics our supply chain operations are focused on creating a competitive advantage through ensuring product availability for our customers effectively using our investment in inventory and managing total supply chain costs following the completion of our rdc rollout our initiatives in fiscal 2011  have been to further optimize and efficiently operate our network build new logistics capabilities and improve our inventory management systems and processes 

our distribution strategy is to provide the optimal flow path for a given product rdcs play a key role in optimizing our network as they allow for aggregation of product needs for multiple stores to a single purchase order and then rapid allocation and deployment of inventory to individual stores upon arrival at the rdc this results in a simplified ordering process and improved transportation and inventory management to enhance our rdc network we continued adding mechanization and at the end of fiscal 2011  15 of our 19 rdcs were mechanized over the past two years we have expanded our transload pilot program to three facilities near ocean ports with a fourth facility expected to become operational in fiscal 2012  transload facilities allow us to improve our import logistics costs and inventory management by enabling imported product to flow through our rdc network in addition we implemented a new distribution forecasting and replenishment system to further improve our inventory management 

we added approximately 15 million net square feet of distribution center space in fiscal 2011  primarily for new repair and liquidation centers as part of our centralized returns system these centers consolidate product from our stores to return to our vendors liquidate or recycle they also provide a small engine repair service for our stores and customers primarily focused on outdoor and hardware power equipment at the end of fiscal 2011  in addition to our 19 rdcs in the us we operated 33 bulk distribution centers which handle products distributed optimally on flat bed trucks in the us and canada we also operated 35 conventional distribution centers which include stocking direct fulfillment and specialty distribution centers in the us canada and mexico in fiscal 2011  we made further progress toward our goal of 75 central distribution penetration in the us our central distribution penetration was approximately 70 as of the end of fiscal   2011  with the remainder of goods shipped directly to our stores from our suppliers we remain committed to leveraging our supply chain capabilities to fully utilize and optimize our improved logistics network 

commitment to environmentally responsible operations  the home depot is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including energy usage supply chain store construction and maintenance and as noted above under energy saving products and programs product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers 

in fiscal 2011  we continued to implement strict operational standards that establish energy efficient practices in all of our facilities these include hvac unit temperature regulation and adherence to strict lighting schedules which are the largest sources of energy consumption in our stores as well as use of energy management systems in each store to monitor energy efficiency we estimate that by implementing and utilizing these energy saving programs we have saved over 45 billion kilowatt hours kwh since 2004 enough to power approximately 400000 us homes for one year and we are on track to meet our goal of a 20 reduction in kwh per square foot in our us stores by 2015 

through our supply chain efficiencies described above under logistics we are targeting a 20 reduction in our domestic supply chain greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 to 2015 which would equate to annual fuel savings of approximately 25 million gallons in fiscal 2011  we also calculated our total carbon dioxide emissions for 2010 and we continue to monitor our carbon footprint from the operation of our stores as well as from our transportation and supply chain activities through our energy conservation and supply chain initiatives we reduced our absolute carbon emissions by approximately 540000 metric tons in 2010 compared to 2009 

with respect to construction of our stores we partnered with the us green building council and have built seven leed for new construction certified and other similarly certified stores in 2011 we also obtained a grant from the us department of energy to help design monitor and verify the energy savings of a new building in lodi california that is designed to consume substantially less energy than the 2007 901 ashrae standards set out by the american society of heating refrigerating and airconditioning engineers an international society that sets forth hvac and refrigeration standards to promote sustainability we also implemented a rainwater reclamation pilot in 2010 and we have retrofitted a number of our stores with reclamation tanks to collect rainwater and condensation from hvac units and garden center roofs which is in turn used to water plants in our outside garden centers in september 2011 we opened a store in st croix in the us virgin islands with both ground mount and roof mount solar panel systems and we estimate the combined total annual energy production of these systems to be up to 570 megawatt hours 

our efforts have resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions for instance in 2011 we were named retail partner of the year by the watersense division of the us environmental protection agency for our overall excellence in water efficiency and we were recognized as a high performer by the carbon disclosure project 

we are also committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business our environmental health  safety ehs function is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our customers and associates with trained associates who evaluate develop implement and enforce policies processes and programs on a companywide basis our ehs policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of the home depot culture some common program elements include daily store inspection checklists by department routine followup audits from our storebased safety team members and regional district and store operations field teams equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety departmental merchandising safety standards training and education programs for all associates with more extensive training provided based on an associates role and responsibilities and awareness communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and understanding of ehs issues 

interconnected retail 

our interconnected retail initiative supports and connects our three other key initiatives in fiscal 2011 we focused on leveraging technology to improve our customers retail experience and provide better access to and information about our products as described above these efforts included information technology solutions that take tasks out of the store and free our associates to devote more time to customerfacing activities they also included significant website enhancements and improvements to our special ordering process that allow customers to more easily find and purchase an expanded array of products and provide a choice in how to receive the order for example through our bopis program through our website which can be accessed through computers smart phones and other mobile devices customers can not only purchase products but can also connect with our associates and with one another to gain product and project knowledge furthermore to increase the productivity and efficiency of our associates merchants and vendors and ensure that the right product is in the right place to meet our customers needs we developed and implemented the improved merchandising tools that provide better visibility into category and item performance and the new distribution forecasting and replenishment system for enhanced inventory management 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national 

hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing inventory levels failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits and health and other insurance costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

we rely on third party suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates supply disruptions shipping interruptions or costs and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation 

if we do not maintain the security of customer associate or company information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

any significant compromise or breach of customer associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in significant costs lost sales fines and lawsuits the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches 

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to analyze process and manage transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of 

our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

disruptions in our customerfacing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences 

through our information technology developments we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform assist and interact with our customers disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network including damage or destruction to our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage labor or workplace regulations the sale of some of our products transportation logistics taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks although we currently maintain an investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2011  there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity 

and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations 

our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in and source from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other legal and regulatory constraints as well as political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include among others potential adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights risks associated with fcpa and local antibribery law compliance challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could be subject to fines and lawsuits 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

net sales increased 35  to  704 billion  for fiscal 2011  from  680 billion  for fiscal 2010  our comparable store sales increased 34  in fiscal 2011  driven primarily by a 26 increase in our comparable store average ticket comparable store sales for our us stores increased 30 in fiscal 2011  

in fiscal 2011  we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives 

customer service  – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of putting customers first taking care of our associates and simplifying the business in fiscal 2011 we rolled out a new scheduling system for our associates and a new centralized return to vendor process as a result we now have approximately 53 of our store labor hours dedicated to customerfacing activity we have a customerfacing store payroll target of 60 and we believe we will achieve that goal by 2013 also in fiscal 2011 we began the process of rolling out instore repair services for power equipment and power tools and we believe this will be a significant improvement in convenience for our customers 

product authority  – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy including innovation assortment and value we are enhancing our special order system and when completed this system will make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our customers and associates as part of this multiphased project to improve our special order performance we digitized our vendor catalogs in fiscal 2011  we also continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments in fiscal 2011  

productivity and efficiency  – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through building bestinclass competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2011  we saw continued benefits from our supply chain investments which improved our instock rate and asset efficiency our inventory turnover ratio was 43  times at the end of fiscal 2011  compared to 41  times at the end of fiscal 2010  additionally as of the end of fiscal 2011 we handled approximately 70 of our us cost of sales through centralized distribution compared to approximately 25 four years ago 

in terms of building shareholder value we repurchased a total of 97 million shares for 35 billion during fiscal 2011 in addition in november 2011 we announced a 16 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 29 cents per share 

interconnected retail  – our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise and we are making the investment to build these capabilities including the roll out of buy online pickup in store bopis which we completed in fiscal 2011 in february 2012 we rolled out a significant upgrade of our website which enhances the layout visual appearance and responsiveness of the site 

we opened 11 new stores including two relocations and closed five stores in fiscal 2011  bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2011  to 2252 as of the end of fiscal 2011  a total of 278 of these stores or 123 were located in canada mexico and china compared to 272 stores or 121 at the end of fiscal 2010

at the end of fiscal 2011  our longterm debttoequity ratio increased to 601  from 461  at the end of fiscal 2010  driven primarily by higher debt levels our return on invested capital computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending longterm debt and equity was 149 for fiscal 2011  compared to 128 for fiscal 2010  

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2011   increased   35  to 704 billion  from 680 billion  for fiscal 2010  the increase  in net sales for fiscal 2011  reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales total comparable store sales increased 34  for fiscal 2011  compared to an increase of 29  for fiscal 2010  

the positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2011  reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives economic growth and favorable weather conditions we experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2011  comparable store sales for our building materials paint hardware tools plumbing electrical and kitchen product categories were above the company average for fiscal 2011  comparable store sales for our flooring bath lighting outdoor garden and indoor garden product categories were positive for fiscal 2011  comparable store sales for our lumber and millwork product categories were negative for fiscal 2011  the increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 26 increase in our comparable store average ticket and an 08 increase in our comparable store customer transactions 

we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets we estimate our share of the us home improvement market is approximately 25 using the us census bureau’s north american industry classification system or naics 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers 

gross profit 

gross profit increased   41  to 243 billion  for fiscal 2011  from 233 billion  for fiscal 2010  gross profit as a percent of net sales was 345  for fiscal 2011  compared to 343  for fiscal 2010  an increase  of 20  basis points the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011  was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the us which was partially offset by higher shrink compared to last year 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased   11  to 160 billion  for fiscal 2011  from 158 billion  for fiscal 2010  as a percent of net sales sga was 228  for fiscal 2011  compared to 233  for fiscal 2010  the decrease  in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2011  reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by a 32 million impairment charge for a noncore carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was sold in fiscal 2011 and 26 million of expenses related to natural disasters additionally we experienced an expense benefit of 44 million in fiscal 2010 related to our private label credit card that did not repeat in fiscal 2011 

depreciation and amortization was 16 billion  for both fiscal 2011  and 2010  depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 22  for fiscal 2011  compared to 24  for fiscal 2010  the decrease  in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets 

operating income 

operating income increased   141  to 67 billion  for fiscal 2011  from 58 billion  for fiscal 2010  operating income as a percent of net sales was 95  for fiscal 2011  compared to 86  for fiscal 2010  

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2011  we recognized 593 million  of interest and other net compared to 566 million  for fiscal 2010  interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 08  for both fiscal 2011  and 2010  interest and other net for fiscal 2010 reflects a 51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply inc the hd supply guarantee extension additionally we experienced a 44 million benefit in fiscal 2010 that arose from favorable internal revenue service irs guidance and a resulting reversal of an interest accrual 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate decreased  to 360  for fiscal 2011  from 367  for fiscal 2010  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 247  for fiscal 2011  compared to 201  for fiscal 2010  excluding the hd supply guarantee extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2010 were 203 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011  reflect 013 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended january 29 2012 

nongaap measures 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance we supplement our reporting with nongaap financial measures to reflect certain adjustments for fiscal 2010 and 2009 the results for fiscal 2010 included a 51 million pretax charge related to the hd supply guarantee extension as described more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the results for the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 fiscal 2009 reflected the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008 these strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming us stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline business rationalization charges related to the exit of our expo thd design center yardbirds and hd bath businesses the exited businesses and charges related to the restructuring of support functions collectively the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements these actions resulted in pretax rationalization charges of 146 million for fiscal 2009 the results for fiscal 2009 also included a pretax charge of 163 million to writedown our investment in hd supply as described more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe these nongaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures there were no adjustments for fiscal 2011 and the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for fiscal 2010  and 2009 amounts in millions except per share data

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 28 to 680 billion from 662 billion for fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales total comparable store sales increased 29 for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 66 for fiscal 2009 

the increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors we experienced positive comparable store sales in 12 of our 14 departments for fiscal 2010 comparable store sales for our lumber tools electrical indoor garden outdoor garden and kitchen product categories were above the company average for fiscal 2010 the increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 24 increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 05 increase in our comparable store average ticket

sga decreased 03 to 158 billion for fiscal 2010 from 159 billion for fiscal 2009 as a percent of net sales sga was 233 for fiscal 2010 compared to 240 for fiscal 2009 excluding the rationalization charges sga as a percent of net sales was 239 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses 

depreciation and amortization decreased 53 to 16 billion for fiscal 2010 from 17 billion for fiscal 2009 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 24 for fiscal 2010 compared to 26 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to fiscal 2009 arising from fully depreciated assets 

operating income 

operating income increased 216 to 58 billion for fiscal 2010 from 48 billion for fiscal 2009 operating income as a percent of net sales was 86 for fiscal 2010 compared to 73 for fiscal 2009 excluding the rationalization charges from the results of fiscal 2009 operating income increased 180 for fiscal 2010

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 367 for fiscal 2010 from 342 for fiscal 2009 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2011  net cash provided by operating activities was  67 billion  compared to  46 billion  for fiscal 2010  this increase was primarily a result of an increase in net earnings changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2011  was  11 billion  compared to  10 billion  for fiscal 2010  this change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and payments for business acquired related to the purchase of an online home services platform partially offset by proceeds from sale of business related to the sale of a noncore carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business in fiscal 2011  we spent  12 billion  on capital expenditures allocated as follows 35 for core technology 17 for maintenance 17 for merchandising and operations 11 for new stores and 20 for other initiatives 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011  was  40 billion  compared to  45 billion  for fiscal 2010  in march 2011 we issued 10 billion of 440 senior notes due april 1 2021 at a discount of 2 million and 10 billion of 595 senior notes due april 1 2041 at a discount of 4 million together the march 2011 issuance interest on these senior notes is due semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year beginning october 1 2011 the net proceeds of the march 2011 issuance were used to repurchase 10 billion of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our 520 senior notes that matured march 1 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of 10 billion 

in connection with the march 2011 issuance we entered into an asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 10 billion of our common stock under the agreement we paid 10 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares in fiscal 2011 also in fiscal 2011 we repurchased an additional 70 million shares of our common stock for 25 billion through the open market since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002 we 

have repurchased 931 million shares of our common stock for a total of 336 billion as of january 29 2012 64 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization 

in may 2010 we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 500 million which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the march 2011 issuance upon the march 2011 issuance we settled this forward starting interest rate swap agreement for an immaterial amount 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 20 billion in connection with the programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion as of january 29 2012  there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility the credit facility expires in july 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants as of january 29 2012  we were in compliance with all of the covenants and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current installments of longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

as of january 29 2012  we guaranteed a 10 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of hd supply we are responsible for up to 10 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by hd supply as reported in the quarterly report on form 10q of hd supply for the period ended october 30 2011  the outstanding balance of this term loan as of october 30 2011  was  930 million  the guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of hd supply the original expiration date of the guarantee was august 30 2012 on march 19 2010 we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to april 1 2014 the fair value of the guarantee at august 30 2007 was 16 million and was recorded as a liability in other longterm liabilities the extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to 67 million resulting in a 51 million charge to interest and other net for fiscal 2010 

as of january 29 2012  we had  20 billion  in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

in march 2011 we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on march 1 2016 with a notional amount of 500 million accounted for as a fair value hedge that swaps fixed rate interest on our 540 senior notes due march 1 2016 for variable interest equal to libor plus 300 basis points at january 29 2012  the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 39 million which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 

also at january 29 2012  we had outstanding interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges that expire on december 16 2013 with a notional amount of 125 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our 125 billion 525 senior notes due december 16 2013 for variable interest equal to libor plus 259 basis points at january 29 2012  the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of 52 million which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements 

in march 2012 we entered into an asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 10 billion of our common stock under the agreement we paid 10 billion to the financial institution using cash on hand and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million  shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the asr agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of january 29 2012  amounts in millions 



  ————— 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at january 29 2012  after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 82 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 18 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

as of january 29 2012  we had net of discounts  103 billion  of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of january 29 2012  was approximately  121 billion  

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 81  valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2011  or 2010  

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011  2010  or 2009  

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation medical product liability and automobile claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2011  2010  or 2009  

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and certain advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations 

as part of our rationalization charges we recorded no material lease obligation costs in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and recorded 84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the rationalization charges a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2011  2010  or 2009  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value the fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition inflation and discount rates a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations a 10 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations 

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to ten years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2011  2010  or 2009  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 asu no 201105 eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income under asu no 201105 an entity can elect to present items of net earnings and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance is effective for publicly traded companies for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter and retrospective application is required as we report other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income the adoption of asu no 201105 will impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 

in june 2009 the fasb issued amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r fasb asc subtopic 81010 which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance fasb asc subtopic 81010 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept fasb asc subtopic 81010 also requires additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement this guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2009 for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets as well as general economic conditions including changes in gross domestic product adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products and services we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers as well as with installers of home improvement products intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and 

  

consumer preferences expectations and needs failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences expectations as to service levels spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits and health and other insurance costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we rely on third party suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates supply disruptions shipping interruptions or cost and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation 

if we do not maintain the security of customer associate or company information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

any significant compromise or breach of customer associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs lost sales fines and lawsuits the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches 

  

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to analyze process and manage transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network including damage or destruction to our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state or local laws and regulations that govern different aspects of our business recently there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements other wage or workplace regulations the sale of some of our products transportation logistics taxes energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 enacted in march 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2010 there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

  

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations 

our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” other legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in international operations also include among others adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local antibribery law compliance additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could be subject to fines and lawsuits 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our thirdparty installers if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

net sales increased 28 to 680 billion for fiscal 2010 from 662 billion for fiscal 2009 our comparable store sales increased 29 in fiscal 2010 driven by a 24 increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 05 increase in our comparable store average ticket to 5193 comparable store sales for our us stores increased 25 in fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2010 we focused on the following four key initiatives 

customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of taking care of our associates putting customers first and simplifying the business the roll out of our customers first training to all store associates and support staff in fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business and we repeated and refreshed the customers first training during fiscal 2010 the customers first program is part of our ongoing commitment to improve customer service levels in our stores and we continued to see the benefit of this training in improved customer service ratings for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 also in fiscal 2010 we completed the deployment of our first phone a new hand held device that provides multiple functions such as inventory management product location and mobile checkout the core purpose of this new device is to reduce tasking time for our store associates to allow them more time to focus on customer service we ended fiscal 2010 with more than half of our store payroll allocated to customer facing activities rather than tasking activities we have a customer facing store payroll target of 60 and we believe we will achieve that by 2013 

product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy including innovation assortment and value in fiscal 2010 we made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the us that helped us manage markdown and clearance activity and better control inventory our inventory turnover ratio was 413 times at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to 406 times at the end of fiscal 2009 additionally we continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments 

  

productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency starts with disciplined capital allocation focused on building bestinclass competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at the end of fiscal 2010 we completed the roll out of our rapid deployment centers “rdcs” and now have 19 rdcs that serve 100 of our us stores also during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 809 million shares for 26 billion and on february 22 2011 we announced a six percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 25 cents per share 

interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise and we are making the investment to build these capabilities including the roll out of “buy online pickup in store” next year we are committed to having a bestinclass website and during fiscal 2010 our site was named as a most improved website for customer satisfaction by foresee a leading customer satisfaction analytics firm 

we opened eight new stores in fiscal 2010 including one relocation and closed three stores bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2010 to 2248 as of the end of fiscal 2010 a total of 272 of these stores or 121 were located in canada mexico and china compared to 268 stores or 119 at the end of fiscal 2009 

we generated approximately 46 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 we used this cash flow along with cash on hand to fund 26 billion of share repurchases pay 16 billion of dividends and fund 11 billion in capital expenditures 

at the end of fiscal 2010 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 461 compared to 447 at the end of fiscal 2009 our return on invested capital for continuing operations computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending longterm debt and equity was 128 for fiscal 2010 compared to 107 for fiscal 2009 this increase reflects the impact of the rationalization charges which were included in our operating profit for fiscal 2009 excluding the rationalization charges our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 127 for fiscal 2010 compared to 111 for fiscal 2009 

  

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations 

 

 note certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 28 to 680 billion from 662 billion for fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales total comparable store sales increased 29 for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 66 for fiscal 2009 

the increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors we experienced positive comparable store sales in 11 of our 13 departments for fiscal 2010 comparable store sales for our lumber tools electrical indoor garden outdoor garden and kitchenbath product categories were above the company average for fiscal 2010 the increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 24 increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 05 increase in our comparable store average ticket to 5193 

we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets we estimate our share of the us home improvement market is approximately 26 using the us census bureau’s north american industry classification system or naics 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 40 to 233 billion for fiscal 2010 from 224 billion for fiscal 2009 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 343 for fiscal 2010 compared to 339 for fiscal 2009 an increase of 40 basis points our us stores experienced gross profit margin expansion in fiscal 2010 as we realized benefits from better product assortment management through our portfolio approach and leveraging of our newly developed merchandising tools lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores for fiscal 2010 compared to last year also contributed to this expansion additionally we realized gross profit margin expansion from our nonus businesses primarily canada due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” decreased 03 to 158 billion for fiscal 2010 from 159 billion for fiscal 2009 as a percent of net sales sga was 233 for fiscal 2010 compared to 240 for fiscal 2009 excluding the rationalization charges sga as a percent of net sales was 239 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses 

depreciation and amortization decreased 53 to 16 billion for fiscal 2010 from 17 billion for fiscal 2009 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 24 for fiscal 2010 compared to 26 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to last year arising from fully depreciated assets 

operating income 

operating income increased 216 to 58 billion for fiscal 2010 from 48 billion for fiscal 2009 operating income as a percent of net sales was 86 for fiscal 2010 compared to 73 for fiscal 2009 excluding the rationalization charges from the results of fiscal 2009 operating income increased 180 for fiscal 2010 

  

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2010 we recognized 566 million of interest and other net compared to 821 million for fiscal 2009 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 08 for fiscal 2010 compared to 12 for fiscal 2009 interest and other net reflects a 51 million charge in fiscal 2010 related to the hd supply guarantee extension and a 163 million charge in fiscal 2009 to writedown our investment in hd supply excluding these charges interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 08 for fiscal 2010 compared to 10 for fiscal 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a 44 million benefit arising from favorable irs guidance resulting in the reversal of an interest accrual during fiscal 2010 a lower cost of outstanding indebtedness than last year and an interest benefit arising from certain state income tax settlements 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 367 for fiscal 2010 from 342 for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 201 for fiscal 2010 and 155 for fiscal 2009 excluding the hd supply guarantee extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results and the rationalization charges and the writedown of our investment in hd supply from our fiscal 2009 results diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were 203 compared to 166 for fiscal 2009 an increase of 223 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 reflect 004 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we supplement our reporting with nongaap financial measures to reflect adjustments for the 51 million pretax charge related to the hd supply guarantee extension as described more fully in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the net sales from exited businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing and the charges to writedown our investment in hd supply of 163 million in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 as described more fully in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we believe these nongaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

  

the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 amounts in millions except per share data 

 

   

nongaap measures continued 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal year ended february 1 2009 “fiscal 2008” 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 72 to 662 billion from 713 billion for fiscal 2008 the decrease in net sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 total comparable store sales decreased 66 for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 87 for fiscal 2008 

there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline the us residential construction housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment we saw relative strength in our building materials flooring paint plumbing and gardenseasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the company average for fiscal 2009 comparable store sales for our lumber hardware electrical kitchenbath and millwork product categories were below the company average for fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 we also saw significant strengthening of the us dollar against all currencies fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total company sales by approximately 565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 66 to 224 billion for fiscal 2009 from 240 billion for fiscal 2008 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 339 for fiscal 2009 compared to 337 for fiscal 2008 an increase of 22 basis points through our focused bay portfolio approach our us merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin additionally gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to fiscal 2008 

operating expenses 

sga decreased 109 to 159 billion for fiscal 2009 from 178 billion for fiscal 2008 as a percent of net sales sga was 240 for fiscal 2009 compared to 250 for fiscal 2008 excluding the rationalization 

  

charges sga as a percent of net sales was 239 for fiscal 2009 compared to 237 for fiscal 2008 our sga results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control for fiscal 2009 the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 251 compared to 281 for fiscal 2008 

depreciation and amortization decreased 44 to 17 billion for fiscal 2009 from 18 billion for fiscal 2008 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26 for fiscal 2009 and 25 for fiscal 2008 the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was primarily due to lower sales 

operating income 

operating income increased 102 to 48 billion for fiscal 2009 from 44 billion for fiscal 2008 operating income as a percent of net sales was 73 for fiscal 2009 compared to 61 for fiscal 2008 excluding the rationalization charges operating income as a percent of net sales was 75 for fiscal 2009 compared to 74 for fiscal 2008 

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2009 we recognized 821 million of interest and other net compared to 769 million in fiscal 2008 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 12 for fiscal 2009 compared to 11 for fiscal 2008 interest and other net reflects a 163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to writedown our investment in hd supply excluding these charges interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for fiscal 2009 compared to 09 for fiscal 2008 the increase in interest and other net as a percent of net sales was primarily due to lower sales 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 342 for fiscal 2009 from 356 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 155 for fiscal 2009 and 137 for fiscal 2008 excluding the rationalization charges and the writedowns of our investment in hd supply diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 were 166 compared to 178 for fiscal 2008 a decrease of 67 

discontinued operations 

on august 30 2007 the company closed the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of 41 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share compared to a loss of 52 million net of tax or 003 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of hd supply 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 46 billion compared to approximately 51 billion for fiscal 2009 this decrease was primarily a result of changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items partially offset by increased earnings 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 was 10 billion compared to 755 million for fiscal 2009 this change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of property and equipment 

  

in fiscal 2010 we spent 11 billion on capital expenditures allocated as follows 34 for core technology 18 for merchandising and operations 17 for maintenance 9 for new stores and 22 for other initiatives in fiscal 2010 we added eight new stores including one relocation 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 was 45 billion compared to 35 billion for fiscal 2009 this increase was primarily due to 24 billion more in repurchases of common stock than in fiscal 2009 partially offset by a 998 million increase in proceeds from longterm borrowings and a 745 million decrease in repayments of longterm debt in fiscal 2010 

we repurchased 809 million shares of our common stock for 26 billion in fiscal 2010 and 77 million shares for 213 million in fiscal 2009 since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002 we have repurchased 8344 million shares of our common stock for a total of 301 billion as of january 30 2011 99 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 20 billion in connection with the programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion as of january 30 2011 there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility the credit facility expires in july 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants as of january 30 2011 we were in compliance with all of the covenants and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current installments of longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 2010 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 461 compared to 447 at the end of fiscal 2009 

as of january 30 2011 we guaranteed a 10 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of hd supply we are responsible for up to 10 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by hd supply as reported in the quarterly report on form 10q of hd supply for the period ended october 31 2010 the outstanding balance of this term loan as of october 31 2010 was 940 million the guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of hd supply the original expiration date of the guarantee was august 30 2012 on march 19 2010 we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to april 1 2014 the fair value of the guarantee at august 30 2007 was 16 million and was recorded as a liability in other longterm liabilities the extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to 67 million resulting in a 51 million charge to interest and other net for fiscal 2010 

as of january 30 2011 we had 545 million in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments share repurchases and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 we repaid 10 billion of 520 senior notes that were due march 1 2011 we issued commercial paper to repay the 520 senior notes and plan to refinance this debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 

at january 30 2011 we had outstanding interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges that expire on december 16 2013 with a notional amount of 125 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our 125 billion 525 senior notes for variable interest equal to libor plus 259 basis points at january 30 2011 the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of 47 million which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements 

in may 2010 we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 500 million accounted for as cash flow hedge to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing longterm debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2011 at january 30 2011 the approximate fair market value of this 

  

agreement was a liability of 2 million which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement 

in september 2010 we issued 500 million of 395 senior notes due september 15 2020 at a discount of 1 million and 500 million of 540 senior notes due september 15 2040 at a discount of 1 million together the “september 2010 issuance” the net proceeds of the september 2010 issuance were used to refinance our 4625 senior notes that matured august 15 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of 10 billion 

in fiscal 2009 and 2010 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of 10 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the september 2010 issuance which were accounted for as cash flow hedges upon the september 2010 issuance we paid 193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements this amount net of income taxes is included in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the lives of the senior notes issued in september 2010 

in march 2011 we entered into an interest rate swap accounted for as a fair value hedge that expires on march 1 2016 with a notional amount of 500 million that swaps fixed rate interest on our 500 million 540 senior notes due march 1 2016 for variable interest equal to libor plus 300 basis points 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of january 30 2011 amounts in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating rate debt portfolio at january 30 2011 after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 87 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 13 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

as of january 30 2011 we had net of discounts 93 billion of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of the publicly traded senior notes as of january 30 2011 was approximately 98 billion 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

revenues 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 80 valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like us with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2010 or 2009 

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory “swell” is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

  

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation medical product liability and automobile claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations 

as part of our rationalization charges we recorded no asset impairments in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and recorded 580 million of asset impairments in fiscal 2008 also as part of our rationalization charges we recorded no lease obligation costs in fiscal 2010 and recorded 84 million and 252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the 

  

rationalization charges a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations we also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value the fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition inflation and discount rates a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations a 10 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations 

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range up to 20 years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” “fasb asc 81010” which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance fasb asc 81010 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept fasb asc 81010 also requires additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement this guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2009 for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued guidance to clarify that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the twoclass method this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing residential construction and home improvement markets adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets could adversely impact consumer confidence causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services other factors – including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit weather natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control – could further adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance 

strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer services price store location and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with specialty design stores showrooms discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences expectations and needs failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences expectations as to service levels spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs 

our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates to be successful we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers while at the same time controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations such as the proposed employee free choice act and health and other insurance costs in addition we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future in addition our centralization of certain human resources functions might not be readily adapted by our associates and therefore might not provide the anticipated benefits 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins 

we rely on third party suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers particularly in light of recent economic conditions suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation 

if we do not maintain the security of customer associate or company information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

any significant compromise or breach of customer associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs lost sales fines and lawsuits the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches 

  

a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to analyze process and manage transactions and data we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business we or our service providers could experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive time consuming and resourceintensive to remedy 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations 

changes in the federal state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business in addition changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business passage of the employee free choice act or other similar laws in congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations healthcare reform if enacted could also adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2009 there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted due to current economic conditions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and continued volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in our international operations 

our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including any expansion in international markets may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” other legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in international operations also include among others adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local antibribery law compliance additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

  

if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business we could be subject to fines and lawsuits 

we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through thirdparty installers as such we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors which include management of licensing permitting and quality of our thirdparty installers we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction if we fail to manage these processes effectively we could suffer lost sales fines and lawsuits 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters

at the end of fiscal 2009 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 447 compared to 544 at the end of fiscal 2008 our return on invested capital for continuing operations computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending longterm debt and equity was 107 at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to 95 for fiscal 2008 excluding rationalization charges our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 111 for fiscal 2009 compared to 114 for fiscal 2008 

  

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 72 to 662 billion from 713 billion for fiscal 2008 the decrease in net sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 total comparable store sales decreased 66 for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 87 for fiscal 2008 

there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline the us residential construction housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment we saw relative strength in our building materials flooring paint plumbing and gardenseasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the company average for fiscal 2009 comparable store sales for our lumber hardware electrical kitchenbath and millwork product categories were below the company average for fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 we also saw significant strengthening of the us dollar against all currencies fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total company sales by approximately 565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to last year 

we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets we estimate our share of the us home improvement market is approximately 21 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 66 to 224 billion for fiscal 2009 from 240 billion for fiscal 2008 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 339 for fiscal 2009 compared to 337 for fiscal 2008 an increase of 22 basis points through our focused bay portfolio approach our us merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin additionally gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to last year 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” decreased 109 to 159 billion for fiscal 2009 from 178 billion for fiscal 2008 as a percent of net sales sga was 240 for fiscal 2009 compared to 250 for fiscal 2008 excluding the rationalization charges sga as a percent of net sales was 239 for fiscal 2009 compared to 237 for fiscal 2008 our sga results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control for fiscal 2009 the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 251 compared to 281 for fiscal 2008 

depreciation and amortization decreased 44 to 17 billion for fiscal 2009 from 18 billion for fiscal 2008 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26 for fiscal 2009 and 25 for fiscal 2008 the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was primarily due to lower sales 

operating income 

operating income increased 102 to 48 billion for fiscal 2009 from 44 billion for fiscal 2008 operating income as a percent of net sales was 73 for fiscal 2009 compared to 61 for fiscal 2008 excluding the 

  

rationalization charges operating income as a percent of net sales was 75 for fiscal 2009 compared to 74 for fiscal 2008 

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2009 we recognized 821 million of interest and other net compared to 769 million in fiscal 2008 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 12 for fiscal 2009 compared to 11 for fiscal 2008 interest and other net reflects a 163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to writedown our investment in hd supply excluding these charges interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 10 for fiscal 2009 compared to 09 for fiscal 2008 the increase in interest and other net as a percent of net sales was primarily due to lower sales 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 342 for fiscal 2009 from 356 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and realignment of our foreign corporate structure these benefits positively impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 006 for fiscal 2009 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 155 for fiscal 2009 and 137 for fiscal 2008 excluding the rationalization charges and the writedowns of our investment in hd supply diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 were 166 compared to 178 for fiscal 2008 a decrease of 67 

discontinued operations 

on august 30 2007 the company closed the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of 41 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share compared to a loss of 52 million net of tax or 003 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of hd supply 

nongaap measures 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance for fiscal 2009 and 2008 we supplement our reporting with nongaap financial measures to reflect adjustments for the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the net sales from exited businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing and the charges to writedown our investment in hd supply as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we believe these nongaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency however this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

  

the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for fiscal 2009 and 2008 amounts in millions except per share data 

 

  

   

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal year ended february 3 2008 “fiscal 2007” 

net sales 

fiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2007 net sales for fiscal 2008 decreased 78 to 713 billion from 773 billion for fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales and 11 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007 partially offset by net sales of 18 billion from new stores in fiscal 2008 comparable store sales decreased 87 for fiscal 2008 compared to a decrease of 67 for fiscal 2007 

there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline the us residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an acrosstheboard tightening of consumer credit availability we saw relative strength in building materials plumbing gardenseasonal and hardware as comparable store sales in these areas were above or at the company average for fiscal 2008 comparable store sales for lumber flooring paint electrical kitchenbath and millwork were below the company average for fiscal 2008 softness in our big ticket categories negatively impacted average ticket which decreased 33 to 5561 for fiscal 2008 our new stores cannibalized approximately 5 of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2008 which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 77 to 240 billion for fiscal 2008 from 260 billion for fiscal 2007 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 337 for fiscal 2008 compared to 336 for fiscal 2007 an increase of four basis points this gross margin expansion included 30 million in markdowns taken in connection with our rationalization charges excluding these markdowns our gross profit as a percent of net sales increased eight basis points for fiscal 2008 reflecting our focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment 

operating expenses 

sga increased 47 to 178 billion for fiscal 2008 from 171 billion for fiscal 2007 as a percent of net sales sga was 250 for fiscal 2008 compared to 221 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2008 was 237 an increase of approximately 170 basis points over the prior year the increase in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment as well as an increase of approximately 70 basis points due to a higher cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program for fiscal 2008 the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 281 compared to 294 for fiscal 2007 

depreciation and amortization increased 49 to 18 billion for fiscal 2008 from 17 billion for fiscal 2007 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 25 for fiscal 2008 and 22 for fiscal 2007 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to sales deleverage and the depreciation of our investments in shorter lived assets such as store resets and technology 

operating income 

operating income decreased 398 to 44 billion for fiscal 2008 from 72 billion for fiscal 2007 operating income as a percent of net sales was 61 for fiscal 2008 compared to 94 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges operating income as a percent of net sales was 74 for fiscal 2008 

interest and other net 

in fiscal 2008 we recognized 769 million of interest and other net compared to 622 million in fiscal 2007 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 11 for fiscal 2008 compared to 08 for fiscal 2007 

  

interest and other net reflects a 163 million charge to writedown our investment in hd supply excluding this charge interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 09 for fiscal 2008 

provision for income taxes 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 356 for fiscal 2008 from 364 for fiscal 2007 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects lower state and foreign effective tax rates 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 137 for fiscal 2008 and 227 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges and the writedown of our investment in hd supply diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 were 178 a decrease of 216 from fiscal 2007 the 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 004 for fiscal 2007 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock we repurchased 24 million shares for 70 million in fiscal 2008 and 293 million shares for 108 billion in fiscal 2007 

discontinued operations 

on august 30 2007 the company closed the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 consist of a loss of 52 million net of tax or 003 per diluted share related to the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 consist of the results of operations for hd supply through august 30 2007 and a 4 million loss on the sale of hd supply net sales from discontinued operations were 74 billion for fiscal 2007 and earnings from discontinued operations net of tax were 185 million for fiscal 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 51 billion compared to 55 billion for fiscal 2008 this change was a result of lower earnings excluding noncash impairment charges and reduced cash flows from working capital items 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2009 was 755 million compared to 17 billion for fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of 881 million less in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2009 we spent 966 million on capital expenditures allocated as follows 26 for merchandising and operations 19 for maintenance 19 for core technology 15 for new stores and 21 for other initiatives in fiscal 2009 we added 13 new stores 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 was 35 billion compared with 37 billion for fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily due to repayments in fiscal 2008 of 17 billion of shortterm commercial paper and 282 million of structured financing debt compared to 18 billion in repayments of longterm debt in fiscal 2009 

we repurchased 77 million shares of our common stock for 213 million in fiscal 2009 and 24 million shares for 70 million in fiscal 2008 since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002 we have repurchased 7536 million shares of our common stock for a total of 275 billion as of january 31 2010 125 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 325 billion in connection with the programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 325 billion as 

  

of january 31 2010 there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility the credit facility expires in december 2010 and contains various restrictive covenants as of january 31 2010 we were in compliance with all of the covenants and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources in august 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the potential future issuance of debt securities replacing a shelf registration statement that had expired 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current installments of longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 2009 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 447 compared to 544 at the end of fiscal 2008 

as of january 31 2010 we guaranteed a 10 billion senior secured amortizing term loan “guaranteed loan” in connection with the sale of hd supply the fair value of the guarantee which was determined to be approximately 16 million is recorded as a liability and included in other longterm liabilities we are responsible for up to 10 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by hd supply the guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of hd supply the original expiration date of the guarantee was august 30 2012 on march 19 2010 we amended the expiration date and extended it to april 1 2014 

as of january 31 2010 we had 14 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 

at january 31 2010 we had outstanding interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges that expire on december 16 2013 with a notional amount of 125 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our 125 billion 525 senior notes for variable interest equal to libor plus 259 basis points at january 31 2010 the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of 12 million which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements 

in november 2009 we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 500 million accounted for as a cash flow hedge to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing longterm debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2010 at january 31 2010 the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of 3 million which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 

during fiscal 2008 and 2007 we entered into interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges with notional amounts of 30 billion that swapped fixed rate interest on our 30 billion 540 senior notes for variable rate interest equal to libor plus 60 to 149 basis points in fiscal 2008 we received 56 million to settle these swaps which is being amortized to reduce net interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of january 31 2010 amounts in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates interest rate swap agreements are used at times to manage our fixedfloating debt portfolio at january 31 2010 after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements approximately 87 of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixedrate debt and 13 was floatingrate debt a 10 percentage point change in the interest costs of floatingrate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

as of january 31 2010 we had net of discounts 93 billion of senior notes outstanding the aggregate market value of the publicly traded senior notes as of january 31 2010 was approximately 95 billion 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 82 valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like the home depot with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2009 or 2008 

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory “swell” is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability product liability automobile workers’ compensation and medical claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate 

  

of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses management’s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level 

the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value the estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including gross margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a leased location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition and inflation a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations 

as part of our rationalization charges we recorded no asset impairment and 84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 compared to 580 million of asset impairments and 252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2008 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the rationalization charges a 10 decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10 increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on results of operations we also recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicators warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value the fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows 

we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates economic conditions market competition inflation and discount rates a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations a 10 percentage point 

  

increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations 

we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which range from 1 to 20 years unless such lives are deemed indefinite intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment or more often if indicators warrant we recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued “the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “fasb asc 10510” which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification “codification” as the sole source for authoritative us gaap and supersedes all accounting standards in us gaap aside from those issued by the sec fasb asc 10510 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september 15 2009 the adoption of the codification did not have an impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations in accordance with the codification references to previously issued accounting standards have been replaced by fasb asc references 

in june 2009 the fasb issued “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” “fasb asc 81010” which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance fasb asc 81010 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept fasb asc 81010 also requires additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2009 for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued guidance to clarify that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the twoclass method this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the possible adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not perceive them to be material such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

 

the state of the housing construction and home improvement markets rising costs a reduction in the availability of financing weather and other conditions in north america could further adversely affect our costs of doing business demand for our products and services and our financial performance 

 

in 2008 the housing residential construction and home improvement markets have deteriorated dramatically and more severely than was previously anticipated we expect the deterioration to continue through 2009 and our fiscal 2009 net sales and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to decline from fiscal 2008 other factors — including increasing unemployment and foreclosures interest rate fluctuations fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs the availability of financing the state of the credit markets including mortgages home equity loans and consumer credit consumer confidence weather natural disasters and other factors beyond our control — could further adversely affect demand for our products and services and our financial performance these and other similar factors could increase our costs and cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services 

 

we rely on third party suppliers if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

 

we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control 

 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

 

as part of our focus on product differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation 

our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets 

 

we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets including our commercial paper programs supported by a longterm bank lineofcredit commitment although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2008 there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets if needed will not be adversely impacted if the current recessionary trends persist or worsen continued volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us 

 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers with a better experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to design attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products sales and profit margins 

 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins 

 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations 

 

changes in the federal state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business in addition changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business also passage of the employee free choice act or other similar laws in congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations 

 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates 

 

to be successful we must attract train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while controlling labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs in addition many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates we compete with other retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

 

increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive we compete principally based on price store location customer service and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers in addition we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design professionals local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

 

the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous and a significant privacy breach could adversely affect our business 

 

the protection of our customer employee and company data is important to us the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business in addition our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information a significant breach of customer employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales fines and lawsuits 

 

any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance 

 

we expect to increase our presence in certain existing markets and enter new markets our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to identify attractive locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms attract and train qualified employees and manage preopening expenses including construction costs 

 

environmental regulations local zoning issues and other laws related to land use affect our ability to open new stores failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in expanding our international operations 

 

our strategy includes expansion of our operations in international markets by selective acquisitions strategic alliances and the opening of new stores our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our us operations in addition international expansion may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local antibribery law compliance additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings data 

 

for fiscal year ended february 1 2009 “fiscal 2008” we reported net earnings of 23 billion and diluted earnings per share of 134 compared to net earnings of 44 billion and diluted earnings per share of 237 for fiscal year ended february 3 2008 “fiscal 2007” 

 

we took action on several strategic items in fiscal 2008 resulting in total pretax charges of 951 million “rationalization charges” these rationalization charges included the closing of 15 underperforming stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store opening pipeline the planned exit of our expo thd design center yardbirds and hd bath businesses and strategic support staff reductions additionally fiscal 2008 included a 163 million pretax writedown of our investment in hd supply and a 52 million loss from discontinued operations net of tax for the settlement of working capital from the sale of hd supply 

 

fiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks for fiscal 2007 the 53 rd week added approximately 11 billion in net sales and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 004 for fiscal 2007 

 

we reported earnings from continuing operations of 23 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 137 for fiscal 2008 compared to earnings from continuing operations of 42 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 227 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges and the writedown of our investment in hd supply earnings from continuing operations were 30 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 178 for fiscal 2008 

 

net sales decreased 78 to 713 billion for fiscal 2008 from 773 billion for fiscal 2007 excluding the 53 rd week of fiscal 2007 net sales decreased 65 for fiscal 2008 the slowdown in the global economy and weakness in the us residential construction and home improvement markets negatively impacted our net sales for fiscal 2008 our comparable store sales declined 87 in fiscal 2008 driven by a 55 decline in comparable store customer transactions as well as a 33 decline in our average ticket 

 

in fiscal 2008 despite the continuing difficult economic environment we continued to focus on our core retail business investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service we have exited noncore businesses restructured support staff and have stopped applying significant capital to building new square footage we remain committed to the longterm health of our business through our strategy of investing in our retail business through the following five priorities 

 

associate engagement – we have taken a number of actions to improve associate engagement by changing the way our associates are compensated recognized and rewarded including enhancing our success sharing program an incentive program for our hourly associates driven by individual store performance success sharing payouts will be received by 83 of our stores for the second half of fiscal 2008 compared to 44 of stores for the same period last year 

 

product excitement – we continue to work on our merchandising transformation by redefining how we run our business implementing a focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment and creating new tools to support better merchandising decision making as a result we saw consumer unit share gains against the market in several key merchandising classes for example carpet hand tools power tools blinds bath fixtures windows and doors all gained share in fiscal 2008 our new lower price campaign is a major component of our portfolio strategy an example is interior paint where we have lowered prices on items such as behr flat premium plus unit sales are increasing and at the same time our attachment sales of related items are going up 

 

shopping environment – we continued our store reinvestment by completing an aggressive list of maintenance projects including the completion of our lighting upgrade as well as more complex repair and maintenance activities for hundreds of other stores in addition to programmatic maintenance our integrated field and support center teams have rolled out store standards to all stores we developed and piloted common guidelines on store appearance and shopability including standards for front apron merchandising wingstack usage signage presentation fixturing and offshelf product this 

initiative helps reduce the amount of time our store managers spend on these issues removes unnecessary clutter from the aisles and implements a basic and consistent approach to store appearance 

 

product availability – we continued our supply chain transformation to improve product availability we have five rdcs operating that now serve approximately 500 of our stores we plan to open additional rdcs in fiscal 2009 and expect that they will serve approximately 1000 of our stores by the end of fiscal 2009 we remain committed to our overall rollout strategy for rdcs supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration 

 

own the pro – we have made significant improvements in the services we provide our pro customers particularly through our pro bid room the pro bid room which is available in all of our stores allows us to leverage the buying power of the home depot for the benefit of our pro customers our direct ship program allows us to have large orders delivered from our vendors to the customer’s job site directly reducing handling leadtime and cost while building loyalty with the pro customer 

 

we opened 62 new stores in fiscal 2008 including 6 relocations closed 15 stores as part of our store rationalization actions and closed one store in mexico due to a fire bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2008 to 2274 as of the end of fiscal 2008 262 or approximately 12 of our stores were located in canada mexico and china compared to 243 as of fiscal 2007 

 

we generated 55 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 we used this cash flow to repay 20 billion of shortterm debt and other debt obligations fund 18 billion in capital expenditures and pay 15 billion of dividends 

 

at the end of fiscal 2008 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 544 compared to 643 at the end of fiscal 2007 our return on invested capital for continuing operations computed on the average of beginning and ending longterm debt and equity for the trailing twelve months was 95 at the end of fiscal 2008 compared to 139 for fiscal 2007 this decrease reflects the decline in our operating profit which includes the impact of the rationalization charges excluding rationalization charges our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 114 

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations we believe the information presented in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides an understanding of our business our operations and our financial condition 

 

 

 

 

  

results of operations 

 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

net sales 

 

fiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2007 net sales for fiscal 2008 decreased 78 to 713 billion from 773 billion for fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales and 11 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007 partially offset by net sales of 18 billion from new stores in fiscal 2008 comparable store sales decreased 87 for fiscal 2008 compared to a decrease of 67 for fiscal 2007 

 

there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline the us residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an acrosstheboard tightening of consumer credit availability we saw relative strength in building materials plumbing gardenseasonal and hardware as comparable store sales in these areas were above or at the company average for fiscal 2008 comparable store sales for lumber flooring paint electrical kitchenbath and millwork were below the company average for fiscal 2008 softness in our big ticket categories negatively impacted average ticket which decreased 33 to 5561 for fiscal 2008 

 

in order to meet our customer service objectives we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores “cannibalize” to enhance service levels gain incremental sales and increase market penetration our new stores cannibalized approximately 5 of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2008 which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1 

 

we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets due to the highlyfragmented us home improvement industry in which we estimate our market share is approximately 20 measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit decreased 77 to 240 billion for fiscal 2008 from 260 billion for fiscal 2007 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 337 for fiscal 2008 compared to 336 for fiscal 2007 an increase of four basis points this gross margin expansion included 30 million in markdowns taken in connection with our rationalization charges excluding these markdowns our gross profit as a percent of net sales increased eight basis points for fiscal 2008 reflecting our focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 47 to 178 billion for fiscal 2008 from 171 billion for fiscal 2007 as a percent of net sales sga was 250 for fiscal 2008 compared to 221 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2008 was 237 an increase of approximately 170 basis points over the prior year the increase in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment as well as an increase of approximately 70 basis points due to a higher cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program for fiscal 2008 the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 281 compared to 294 for fiscal 2007 

 

depreciation and amortization increased 49 to 18 billion for fiscal 2008 from 17 billion for fiscal 2007 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 25 for fiscal 2008 and 22 for fiscal 2007 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to sales deleverage and the depreciation of our investments in shorter lived assets such as store resets and technology 

 

operating income 

 

operating income decreased 398 to 44 billion for fiscal 2008 from 72 billion for fiscal 2007 operating income as a percent of net sales was 61 for fiscal 2008 compared to 94 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges operating income as a percent of net sales was 74 for fiscal 2008 

interest and other net 

 

in fiscal 2008 we recognized 769 million of interest and other net compared to 622 million in fiscal 2007 interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 11 for fiscal 2008 compared to 08 for fiscal 2007 interest and other net reflects a 163 million charge to writedown our investment in hd supply excluding this charge interest and other net as a percent of net sales was 09 for fiscal 2008 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 356 for fiscal 2008 from 364 for fiscal 2007 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects lower state and foreign effective tax rates 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 137 for fiscal 2008 and 227 for fiscal 2007 excluding the rationalization charges and the writedown of our investment in hd supply diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 were 178 a decrease of 216 from fiscal 2007 the 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 004 for fiscal 2007 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock we repurchased 24 million shares for 70 million in fiscal 2008 and 293 million shares for 108 billion in fiscal 2007 since the inception of the repurchase program in 2002 we have repurchased 746 million shares of our common stock for a total of 273 billion 

 

discontinued operations 

 

on august 30 2007 the company closed the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 consist of a loss of 52 million net of tax or 003 per diluted share recorded to settle net working capital matters arising from the sale of hd supply discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 consist of the results of operations for hd supply through august 30 2007 and a 4 million loss on the sale of hd supply net sales from discontinued operations were 74 billion for fiscal 2007 and earnings from discontinued operations net of tax were 185 million for fiscal 2007 

 

nongaap measurements 

 

to provide clarity internally and externally about our operating performance for fiscal 2008 we supplemented our reporting with nongaap measurements to reflect the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the charge to writedown our investment in hd supply as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measurements we believe these nongaap measurements provide management and investors with meaningful information to understand and analyze our performance the following reconciles the nongaap measurements reflecting the rationalization charges and investment writedown to the reported gaap information for fiscal 2008 

 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2007 “fiscal 2006” 

 

net sales 

 

fiscal 2007 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2006 net sales for fiscal 2007 decreased 21 or 17 billion to 773 billion from 790 billion for fiscal 2006 the decrease in net sales for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales partially offset by net sales of 37 billion for fiscal 2007 from new stores and 11 billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007 comparable store sales decreased 67 for fiscal 2007 compared to a decrease of 28 for fiscal 2006 

 

there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline the residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft especially in some of our traditionally strong markets such as florida california and the northeast the combination of softness in our big ticket categories and commodity price deflation negatively impacted average ticket which decreased 24 to 5748 for fiscal 2007 our international business performed well in fiscal 2007 our mexican stores posted a double digit comparable store sales increase for fiscal 2007 and canada’s comparable store sales were also positive our new stores cannibalized approximately 10 of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2007 which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit decreased 21 to 260 billion for fiscal 2007 from 265 billion for fiscal 2006 gross profit as a percent of net sales was 336 for fiscal 2007 flat compared to fiscal 2006 lower deferred interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing programs provided a benefit of 39 basis points to gross profit as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2007 the deferred interest benefit was mostly offset by a higher penetration of lower margin products such as appliances and markdowns taken to clear through some seasonal items such as outdoor power equipment and grills and to allow us to transition into new products such as assembled cabinets and kitchen accessories 

 

operating expenses 

 

sga increased 59 to 171 billion for fiscal 2007 from 161 billion for fiscal 2006 as a percent of net sales sga was 221 for fiscal 2007 compared to 204 for fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 our profit sharing with the thirdparty administrator of the private label credit card portfolio was 275 million less than what we received in fiscal 2006 we also recognized 88 million of writeoffs associated with certain future store locations that we determined we will not open and 34 million of expense associated with closing our 11 home depot landscape supply stores and our tampa call center in fiscal 2007 sga also reflects investments we are making in support of our five key priorities as a percentage of net sales total payroll increased by 76 basis points for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 this reflects investments in store labor and our master trade specialists program the impact of our success sharing bonus plans as well as the negative sales environment the increase in sga for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was partially offset by 129 million of executive severance recorded in fiscal 2006 

 

depreciation and amortization increased 81 to 17 billion for fiscal 2007 from 16 billion for fiscal 2006 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 22 for fiscal 2007 and 20 for fiscal 2006 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology 

 

operating income 

 

operating income decreased 183 to 72 billion for fiscal 2007 from 89 billion for fiscal 2006 operating income as a percent of net sales was 94 for fiscal 2007 compared to 112 for fiscal 2006 

 

interest and other net 

 

in fiscal 2007 we recognized 622 million of net interest expense compared to 364 million in fiscal 2006 net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 08 for fiscal 2007 compared to 05 for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the december 2006 issuance of 750 million of floating rate senior notes 125 billion of 525 senior notes and 30 billion of 5875 senior notes 

provision for income taxes 

 

our combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 364 for fiscal 2007 from 381 for fiscal 2006 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of a onetime retroactive tax assessment received from the canadian province of quebec in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and tax benefits recognized upon settlement of several state audits and completion of the fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax audits in fiscal 2007 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 227 for fiscal 2007 and 255 for fiscal 2006 the 53 rd week increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 004 for fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock 

 

discontinued operations 

 

discontinued operations consist of the results of operations for hd supply through august 30 2007 and a loss on the sale of hd supply net sales from discontinued operations were 74 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to 118 billion for fiscal 2006 earnings from discontinued operations net of tax were 185 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 495 million for fiscal 2006 earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 include a 4 million loss net of tax recognized on the sale of the business 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 55 billion compared to 57 billion for fiscal 2007 this change was primarily a result of decreased net earnings partially offset by improved inventory management 

 

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2008 was 17 billion compared to 48 billion provided by investing activities for fiscal 2007 the change in net cash used inprovided by investing activities was primarily the result of 83 billion of net proceeds from the sale of hd supply in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 partially offset by 17 billion less in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

in fiscal 2008 we spent 18 billion on capital expenditures allocated as follows 45 for new stores 15 for merchandising and operations 12 for maintenance 11 for core technology and 17 for other initiatives in fiscal 2008 we added 62 new stores including six relocations 

 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 was 37 billion compared with 106 billion for fiscal 2007 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 289 million shares of our common stock for 107 billion in connection with our tender offer related to the sale of hd supply in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and by repayments in fiscal 2008 of 17 billion of shortterm commercial paper and 282 million of structured financing debt 

 

we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for 70 million in fiscal 2008 and a total of 293 million shares for 108 billion in fiscal 2007 including a 107 billion tender offer funded primarily using proceeds from the sale of hd supply since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002 we have repurchased 746 million shares of our common stock for a total of 273 billion as of february 1 2009 127 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization given current market conditions we have suspended the repurchase program until our business and credit markets stabilize 

 

we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 325 billion in connection with the programs we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 325 billion as of february 1 2009 there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility the credit facility which expires in december 2010 contains various restrictive covenants all of which we are in compliance none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 2008 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 544 compared to 643 at the end of fiscal 2007 

 

as of february 1 2009 we had 525 million in cash and shortterm investments we believe that our current cash position access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements we intend to use cash flow generated by operations to repay 18 billion in debt coming due in fiscal 2009 

 

during fiscal 2008 and 2007 we entered into interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges with notional amounts of 30 billion that swapped fixed rate interest on our 30 billion 540 senior notes for variable rate interest equal to libor plus 60 to 149 basis points in fiscal 2008 we received 56 million to settle these swaps which will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 

 

at february 1 2009 we had outstanding an interest rate swap accounted for as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of 750 million that swaps variable rate interest on our 750 million floating rate senior notes for fixed rate interest at 436 that expires on december 16 2009 at february 1 2009 the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of 21 million which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle this interest rate swap agreement 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february 1 2009 amounts in millions 

 

 

 

 

 22 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 

 

as of february 1 2009 we had net of discounts 110 billion of senior notes outstanding the market values of the publicly traded senior notes as of february 1 2009 were approximately 100 billion 

 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales tax at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 

 

merchandise inventories 

 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 82 valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method retailers like the home depot with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2008 or 2007 

 

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory “swell” is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

selfinsurance 

 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability product liability automobile workers’ compensation and medical claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

vendor allowances 

 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

 

volume rebates and advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sga 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets when management makes the decision to relocate or close a store or other location or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable a store’s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows a provision is made to write down the related assets to fair value if the carrying value is greater than the fair value we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of longlived assets while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual results differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted impairment losses are recorded as a component of sga in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings when a location closes we also recognize in sga the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income

logistics our logistics programs are designed to ensure excellent product availability for customers effective use of our investment in inventory and low total supply chain costs at the end of fiscal 2006 we operated 18 import distribution centers located in the us and canada at the end of fiscal 2006 we also operated 30 lumber distribution centers in the us and canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and 10 transit facilities to receive merchandise from manufacturers for immediate delivery to our stores at the end of fiscal 2006 approximately 40 of the merchandise shipped to our stores flowed through our network of distribution centers and transit facilities as our networks evolve we expect to increase our flowthrough the remaining merchandise will be shipped directly from our suppliers to our stores in addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores we also provide delivery services directly to our customers 

seasonality our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our business is highly competitive based in part on price store location customer service and depth of merchandise in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in addition to these entities our expo design center stores compete with specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design professionals due to the variety of competition we face we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors 

hd supply segment 

operating strategy our operating strategy is to provide a total solution for every phase of a building project from infrastructure to construction to lifetime maintenance and repair and remodel we believe that our broad product and service offering our highly knowledgeable sales force and our reputation for superior customer service enable us to be a singlesource supplier to our customers for the entire project lifecycle 

customers we distribute products and offer services primarily to builders contractors government entities industrial businesses and maintenance professionals our customers typically select their vendors primarily on the basis of product availability relationships with and expertise of sales personnel price and the quality and scope of services offered additionally professional customers generally purchase large volumes are repeat buyers because of their involvement in longerterm projects and require specialized services we complement our product offering with customerdriven valueadded services such as integrated supply design assistance kitting assembly and fabrication services 

products and services our products and services are focused around the following four major categories that are related to different phases of a building project 

• infrastructure this category covers the products and services to construct and support the public works systems for residential and commercial projects • construction this category covers the interior and exterior structural building components for residential and commercial projects • maintenance this category covers products and services for the routine maintenance repair and operations needs of multifamily housing hospitality healthcare government and industrial facilities • repair and remodel this category covers home improvement products and building materials serving the consumer professional handyman and light remodeler markets inventories we maintain extensive inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers our inventories are based on the needs delivery schedules and lead times of our customers we focus on distributing products that leverage our strengths in inventory management purchasing specialized sales force distribution and logistics credit management and information technology 

credit services over 90 of our sales volume is facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers our businesses offer credit to customers either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer or secured credit for materials sold for a specific job where the security lies in lien rights associated with the material going into the job the type of credit offered depends both on the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved end users resellers and other noncontractor customers generally purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit these lines of credit are granted only after a sufficient review of the creditworthiness of the customer in addition on a regular basis large unsecured credit lines are reviewed to ensure they are still financially sound 

logistics our distribution network consists of over 1000 combined branches and central distribution centers in the united states the efficient operation of our distribution network is critical in providing quality service to our customer base our central distribution centers and branches use warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control and picking packing and shipping functions in addition we leverage several of our larger branches as distribution points for certain product lines 

the majority of customer orders are shipped from inventory at our branches in order to maintain complete control of the delivery process we use over 4000 vehicles from our total vehicle fleet to deliver products to our customers we also accommodate special orders from our customers and facilitate the shipment of certain large volume orders directly from the manufacturer to the customer orders for larger construction projects normally require longterm delivery schedules throughout the period of construction which in some cases may continue for several years 

seasonality our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of our range of products in the united states and we believe that no other company competes against us across all of our product lines however there is significant competition in each of our individual product lines our competition includes other wholesalers manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer base and some of our customers that resell our products to a limited extent retailers of plumbing electrical fixtures and supplies building materials maintenance repair and operations supplies and contractors tools also compete with us competition varies depending on product line customer classification and geographic area the principal competitive factors in our business include but are not limited to availability of materials and supplies technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage advisory or other service capabilities ability to build and maintain customer relationships sameday delivery capabilities in certain product lines pricing of products and provision of credit 

support services 

information technologies during fiscal 2006 we continued to make significant information technology investments to support better customer service and provide an improved shopping environment in our stores we completed the deployment of selfcheckout registers to all our us stores and the majority of our stores in canada and enhanced our coupon processing at all checkouts we also began implementing instore call boxes and installed voice over internet phone systems in order to provide customers faster assistance from our associates to support the continued growth of our appliance business we upgraded our proprietary depot direct appliance fulfillment system 

in addition to significant investments in store technology we upgraded our order management system which improves the speed and accuracy of online order processing and provides customers the ability to check special order status on the internet we also defined a set of common enterprise system platforms for our hd supply wholesale businesses and began migrating the hd supply businesses to these platforms beginning with the payroll and financial functions 

we also began work on the strategic effort to implement a new retail systems platform to further improve the performance of our merchandising functions and store operations we also commenced the effort to add new automation into our supply chain functions focusing on new systems for warehouse distribution transportation management and enhancements to support greater order penetration through our centralized replenishment systems 

associates at the end of fiscal 2006 we employed approximately 364000 associates of whom approximately 26000 were salaried with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis approximately 68 of our associates are employed on a fulltime basis we believe that our employee relations are very good to attract and retain qualified personnel we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve

rising costs a reduction in the availability of financing weather and other conditions in north america could adversely affect our costs of doing business demand for our products and services and our average ticket price 

interest rates fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs availability of financing employment state of the residential construction and housing markets consumer confidence and general economic outlook weather natural disasters terrorism and other conditions that adversely 

affect consumer demand for our products and services could adversely affect our financial performance these and other similar factors could 

• increase our costs • cause our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects • cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services • cause our customers to delay or determine not to undertake new spending in the commercial residential industrial and public infrastructure markets and • lead to a decline in customer transactions and in average ticket price we rely on third party suppliers and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our products and supplies from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products and supplies also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate us from our competitors 

as part of our strategy of differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute our strategy of differentiation 

any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance 

we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to 

• identify attractive locations • negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms • attract and train qualified employees and • manage preopening expenses including construction costs our ability to open new stores also will be affected by environmental regulations local zoning issues and other laws related to land use failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance 

the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and our technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our stores and branches and in our administrative functions our technology initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers a better experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to design attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products sales and profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in expanding our international operations 

our strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions strategic alliances and the opening of new stores and branches our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our us operations in addition our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates 

to be successful we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs in addition many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and 

motivating them we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment inventories selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

we operate in markets in industries that are highly competitive our retail business competes principally based on price store location customer service and depth of merchandise our hd supply business competes principally based on ability to provide and deliver supplies product knowledge and expertise advisory services and availability of credit in each market we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers in addition we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design professionals local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including government inquiries and investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities with certainty the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations 

changes in the federal state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business in addition changes to federal state and local tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings data 

for fiscal year ended january 28 2007 fiscal 2006 we reported net earnings of 58 billion and diluted earnings per share of 279 compared to net earnings of 58 billion and diluted earnings per share of 272 for fiscal year ended january 29 2006 fiscal 2005 net sales increased 114 to 908 billion for fiscal 2006 from 815 billion for fiscal 2005 our gross profit margin was 328 and our operating margin was 107 for fiscal 2006 

in the face of a slowdown in the housing market our retail comparable store sales declined 28 in fiscal 2006 driven by a decline in comparable store customer transactions this was partially offset by an increase in our average ticket of 16 in fiscal 2006 to 5890 including increases in 8 of 10 selling departments 

we grew our numerous installation and home maintenance programs serving our doitforme customers through our stores our retail services revenue increased 83 to 38 billion for fiscal 2006 we experienced sustained growth in categories such as countertops exterior patios solar windows and hvac 

we continued to introduce innovative and distinctive merchandise that reflects emerging consumer trends supported by continued investments in store modernization and technology we invested 35 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2006 primarily for new store construction store modernization and technology we began an accelerated store reinvestment program whereby we increased our investment in existing stores by 350 million more than our plan in the second half of fiscal 2006 to enhance the customer experience this investment included capital and expense dollars to reset 100 merchandise bays in 540 stores incorporate a richer staffing model and support our orange juiced program a customer service incentive program for our store associates 

we added 125 new stores in fiscal 2006 including 12 stores through our acquisition of the home way a chinese home improvement retailer and 10 relocations bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2006 to 2147 as of the end of fiscal 2006 228 or approximately 11 of our stores were located in canada mexico or china compared to 191 or approximately 9 at the end of fiscal 2005 

we have expanded our business by capturing a growing share of the professional residential commercial and heavy construction markets through the growth of hd supply hd supply experienced 162 net sales growth in fiscal 2006 and accounted for approximately 13 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 we completed 12 acquisitions in fiscal 2006 that were integrated into hd supply including hughes supply inc a leading distributor of construction and repair products organic net sales growth for the hd supply segment was 56 in fiscal 2006 

in february 2007 we announced our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives for hd supply in order to maximize the value of hd supply we would need to further integrate it with our retail business we are currently evaluating whether this integration or other strategic alternatives such as a sale or initial public offering of the business would create the most shareholder value 

we generated 77 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2006 we used this cash flow along with the net proceeds of additional borrowings of 76 billion to fund 81 billion of share repurchases and dividends 43 billion in acquisitions and 35 billion in capital expenditures at the end of fiscal 2006 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 47 our return on invested capital computed on beginning longterm debt and equity for the trailing four quarters was 205 at the end of fiscal 2006 compared to 224 for fiscal 2005 

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations 

 1 fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 refer to the fiscal years ended january 28 2007 january 29 2006 and january 30 2005 respectively fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 include 52 weeks 2 includes retail segment only 3 includes net sales at locations open greater than 12 months including relocated and remodeled stores retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 365 th day of operation retail comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales or net earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 21 

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

we operate in two reportable business segments retail and hd supply the retail segment is principally engaged in the operation of retail stores located in the united states canada mexico and our recently acquired stores in china the hd supply segment distributes products and sells installation services to businesstobusiness customers including home builders professional contractors municipalities and maintenance professionals we identify segments based on how management makes operating decisions assesses performance and allocates resources the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was the first period in which we began to report our results of operations in two segments this change was a result of the purchase of hughes supply which significantly increased the size of hd supply and resulted in changes in our internal reporting and management structure 

the retail segment includes the home depot stores expo design center stores expo and other retail formats the retail segment also includes our retail services business and our catalog and online sales businesses 

the hd supply segment consists of four major platforms 1 infrastructure including waterworks and utilities 2 construction including construction supply lumber and building materials electrical plumbinghvac and interiors 3 maintenance including facilities maintenance and industrial pvf and 4 repair and remodel 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

net sales 

total net sales for fiscal 2006 increased 114 or 93 billion to 908 billion from 815 billion for fiscal 2005 of the 93 billion increase 73 billion net of intercompany sales came from our hd supply segment and 20 billion came from our retail segment 

net sales for our retail segment were 790 billion for fiscal 2006 a 26 increase over fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006 retail segment net sales growth was primarily driven by sales from new stores retail comparable store sales decreased 28 for fiscal 2006 compared to an increase of 31 for fiscal 2005 the decline in retail comparable store sales was driven by a 46 decline in comparable store customer transactions offset in part by a 16 increase in average ticket our average ticket increased to 5890 for fiscal 2006 and increased in 8 of 10 selling departments the decrease in retail comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 was due to the significant slowdown in the us retail home improvement market as well as difficult yearoveryear comparisons due to sales arising from hurricane activity in fiscal 2005 both canada and mexico however experienced positive retail comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 additionally our retail comparable store sales results reflect in part the impact of cannibalization in order to meet our customer service objectives we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels gain incremental sales and increase market penetration our new stores cannibalized approximately 135 of our existing stores during fiscal 2006 which had a negative impact to retail comparable store sales of approximately 19 

despite the difficult us retail home improvement market we continued to expand our retail services revenue which increased 83 to 38 billion for fiscal 2006 from 35 billion for fiscal 2005 the growth in retail services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops exterior patios solar windows and hvac our retail services programs focus primarily on providing products and services to our doitforme customers our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging babyboomers as they rely more heavily on installation services 

net sales for our hd supply segment for fiscal 2006 were 121 billion an increase of 162 over fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily a result of recent acquisitions organic net sales growth for the hd supply segment was 56 in fiscal 2006 which includes the impact of commodity price inflation and market share gains 

we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets due to the highlyfragmented us home improvement and professional supply industry in which we estimate our market share is approximately 10 measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult 

gross profit 

total gross profit increased 90 to 298 billion for fiscal 2006 from 273 billion for fiscal 2005 gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 73 basis points to 328 for fiscal 2006 compared to 335 for fiscal 2005 the decline in total gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily due to a higher penetration of the lower margin hd supply segment in fiscal 2006 65 basis points of the total gross profit decline was a result of a higher penetration of hd supply businesses as well as a drop in hd supplys gross profit rate due to a change in the mix of businesses owned 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 120 to 201 billion for fiscal 2006 from 180 billion for fiscal 2005 operating expenses as a percent of net sales were 221 for fiscal 2006 compared to 220 for fiscal 2005 

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased 113 to 183 billion for fiscal 2006 from 165 billion for fiscal 2005 as a percent of net sales sga was 202 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 the increase in sga during fiscal 2006 was due to added associate labor hours on the floor of our stores increased spending on store maintenance programs and the expansion of merchandise display resets this increase was partially offset by reduced selfinsurance costs as we continue to realize benefits from safety programs and other initiatives fiscal 2006 sga also reflects benefits from our private label credit card which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit like bank cards through our private label credit card we offer no interestno payment programs the cost of deferred interest associated with these programs is included in cost of sales we believe these programs deliver longterm benefits including higher average ticket and customer loyalty for fiscal 2006 the penetration of our private label credit sales was 280 compared to 256 for fiscal 2005 

also impacting our sga in fiscal 2006 is expense associated with executive severance of 129 million and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r whereby we recorded approximately 40 million of stock compensation expense related to the continued vesting of options granted prior to fiscal 2003 partially offsetting the increase in sga was 91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations associated with the closing of 20 expo stores in fiscal 2005 

depreciation and amortization increased 197 to 18 billion for fiscal 2006 from 15 billion for fiscal 2005 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 19 for fiscal 2006 and 18 for fiscal 2005 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of our recent acquisitions and the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology 

interest net 

in fiscal 2006 we recognized 365 million of net interest expense compared to 81 million in fiscal 2005 net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 04 for fiscal 2006 compared to 01 for fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the march 2006 issuance of 10 billion of 520 senior notes and 30 billion of 540 senior notes and the december 2006 issuance of 750 million of floating rate senior notes 125 billion of 525 senior notes and 30 billion of 5875 senior notes 

provision for income taxes 

our combined federal state and foreign effective income tax rate increased to 381 for fiscal 2006 from 371 for fiscal 2005 the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the impact of a retroactive tax assessment from the canadian province of quebec during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 the quebec national assembly passed legislation that retroactively changed certain tax laws that subjected us to additional tax and interest as a result we received an assessment from quebec for 57 million in retroactive tax and 12 million in related interest for the 2002 through 2005 taxable years 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 279 for fiscal 2006 and 272 for fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our 175 billion repurchase authorization since the inception of the program in 2002 we have repurchased 451 million shares of our common stock for a total of 164 billion including 5 billion through accelerated share repurchases in fiscal 2006 as of january 28 2007 we had 11 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal year ended january 30 2005 fiscal 2004 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2005 increased 115 to 815 billion from 731 billion for fiscal 2004 fiscal 2005 net sales growth was driven by an increase in retail comparable store sales of 31 sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and sales from our newly acquired businesses within hd supply 

the increase in retail comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 reflects a number of factors our average ticket which increased 56 to 5798 increased in all selling departments and our retail comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2005 was positive in 9 of 10 selling departments building materials had the strongest retail comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum roofing concrete and insulation due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern us history we experienced strong retail comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations we also experienced strong retail comparable store sales in our pro categories including plumbing electrical and hardware in fiscal 2005 the impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal 2005 retail comparable store sales growth as of the end of fiscal 2005 certain new stores cannibalized approximately 20 of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2005 retail comparable store sales by approximately 18 

the growth in net sales for fiscal 2005 also reflects growth in services revenue which increased 166 to 35 billion for fiscal 2005 from 30 billion for fiscal 2004 the growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops roofing kitchens windows and hvac 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 118 to 273 billion for fiscal 2005 from 244 billion for fiscal 2004 gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 335 for fiscal 2005 the highest annual rate in our companys history our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close 20 expo stores the increasing penetration of our hd supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs for fiscal 2005 the penetration of our private label credit sales was 256 compared to 241 for fiscal 2004

operating expenses increased 88 to 180 billion for fiscal 2005 from 165 billion for fiscal 2004 operating expenses as a percent of net sales were 220 for fiscal 2005 compared to 226 for fiscal 2004 

sga increased 81 to 165 billion for fiscal 2005 from 153 billion for fiscal 2004 as a percent of net sales sga was 202 for fiscal 2005 compared to 209 for fiscal 2004 the reduction of sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of continued focus on cost takeout initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the company we also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit like bank cards in fiscal 2005 we recorded 52 million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of sga fiscal 2005 was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage and therefore the amount recognized in fiscal 2005 includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program finally for fiscal 2005 we recorded 91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close 20 expo stores 

depreciation and amortization increased 179 to 15 billion for fiscal 2005 from 12 billion for fiscal 2004 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 18 for fiscal 2005 and 17 for fiscal 2004 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology 

interest net 

in fiscal 2005 we recognized 81 million of net interest expense compared to 14 million in fiscal 2004 net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 01 for fiscal 2005 and less than 01 for fiscal 2004 interest expense increased to 143 million for fiscal 2005 from 70 million for fiscal 2004 primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the august 2005 10 billion issuance of 4625 senior notes and the september 2004 10 billion issuance of 375 senior notes interest and investment income increased 107 to 62 million for fiscal 2005 from 56 million for fiscal 2004 due primarily to a higher interest rate environment 

provision for income taxes 

our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to 371 for fiscal 2005 from 368 for fiscal 2004 the majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 272 and 226 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was 77 billion as compared to 66 billion for fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily a result of more productive working capital in fiscal 2006 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 76 billion for fiscal 2006 from 46 billion for fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily the result of an increase in payments for businesses acquired of 17 billion as well as a decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 17 billion partially offset by a 339 million decrease in capital expenditures we paid 43 billion to complete 15 acquisitions in fiscal 2006 including hughes supply our fiscal 2006 acquisitions resulted in increases in receivables merchandise inventories goodwill other assets and accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 28 2007 see note 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

additionally in fiscal 2006 we spent 35 billion on capital expenditures allocated as follows 64 for new stores 11 for store modernization 6 for technology and 19 for other initiatives in fiscal 2006 we added 125 new stores including 12 stores in china through our acquisition of the home way and 10 relocations 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2006 was 203 million compared with 17 billion for fiscal 2005 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of 76 billion from the issuance of additional longterm debt partially offset by a net increase of 42 billion in repurchases of common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

in february 2006 may 2006 and august 2006 our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion 20 billion and 35 billion respectively in our share repurchase program bringing the total authorization by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2002 to 175 billion as of january 28 2007 pursuant to this authorization we have repurchased approximately 451 million shares of our common stock for a total of 164 billion as of january 28 2007 during fiscal 2006 we repurchased approximately 174 million shares of our common stock for 67 billion and during fiscal 2005 we repurchased approximately 76 million shares of our common stock for 30 billion as of january 28 2007 approximately 11 billion remained under our share repurchase program during fiscal 2006 we also increased dividends paid by 628 to 14 billion from 857 million in fiscal 2005 

we have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 25 billion in connection with the program we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion as of january 28 2007 there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility the credit facility which expires in december 2010 contains various restrictions none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers hd supply locations and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 2006 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 465 compared to 99 at the end of fiscal 2005 this increase reflects the net increase in longterm debt as a result of the issuance of senior notes in march and december of fiscal 2006 

as of january 28 2007 we had 614 million in cash and shortterm investments we believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from the 25 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements 

in march 2006 we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 20 billion accounted for as a cash flow hedge to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the issuance of the 540 senior notes due march 1 2016 upon issuance of the hedged debt we settled our forward starting interest rate swap agreement and recorded a 12 million decrease net of income taxes to accumulated other comprehensive income which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 

in may 2006 we entered into a 2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we repurchased approximately 53 million shares of our common stock under the agreement the financial institution purchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock in the open market the shares repurchased by us were subject to a future purchase price adjustment based upon the weighted average price of our common stock over an agreed period subject to a specified collar in august 2006 we settled the accelerated share repurchase we elected settlement in cash and received 61 million from the financial institution which was recorded as an offset to our cost of treasury stock 

in october 2006 we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 10 billion accounted for as a cash flow hedge to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the issuance of the 5875 senior notes due december 16 2036 upon issuance of the hedged debt in december 2006 we settled our forward starting interest rate swap agreement and recorded an 11 million decrease net of income taxes to accumulated other comprehensive income which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 

in december 2006 we entered into a 3 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we repurchased approximately 75 million shares of our common stock under the agreement the financial institution purchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock in the open market the shares repurchased by us were subject to a future purchase price adjustment based upon the weighted average price of our common stock over an agreed period in march 2007 we settled the accelerated share repurchase we elected settlement in cash and received 36 million from the financial institution which was recorded as an offset to our cost of treasury stock in fiscal 2007 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 28 2007 amounts in millions 





1 contractual obligations include longterm debt comprised primarily of 11 billion of senior notes further discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business 2 excludes present value of capital lease obligations of 419 million includes 80 billion of interest payments and 69 million of unamortized discount 3 includes 904 million of imputed interest 4 commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets we issue letters of credit for insurance programs purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services 5 purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases utility purchases capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above additionally we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an offbalance sheet lease related to certain stores for 282 million during 2008 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 

as of january 28 2007 we had net of discounts 109 billion of senior notes outstanding the market values of the publicly traded senior notes as of january 28 2007 were approximately 109 billion 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products during fiscal 2006 lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately 43 basis 

points we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 80 valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method retailers like the home depot with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the consolidated financial statements of the company as of the end of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store distribution center and hd supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability product liability automobile workers compensation and medical claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based 

upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

vendor allowances 

vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising coop allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 

volume rebates and advertising coop allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold certain advertising coop allowances that are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 sab 108 addresses the process of quantifying prior year financial statement misstatements and their impact on current year financial statements the provisions of sab 108 allow companies to report the cumulative effect of correcting immaterial prior year misstatements based on the companys historical method for evaluating misstatements by adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings in the current year financial statements rather than amending previously filed reports sab 108 also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected how the event arose and the fact that the errors are considered immaterial to the prior year financial statements sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 and therefore was effective for the home depot in fiscal 2006 see note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax reporting by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 requires that companies recognize tax benefits in their financial statements for a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and will therefore be effective for the home depot in fiscal 2007 the cumulative impact of adopting fin 48 in fiscal 2007 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition of the company

we buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world and are not dependent on any single supplier most of our merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers which eliminates middleman costs we believe that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all of the products we sell in the home depot stores 

to complement and enhance our product selection we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names during fiscal 2005 we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including but not limited to behr premium plus® paint charmglow® gas grills hampton bay® lighting mills pride® cabinets vigoro® lawn care products husky® hand tools ridgid® and ryobi® power tools pegasus® faucets traffic master® carpet glacier bay® bath fixtures and veranda® decking products we may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to the home depot

to increase customer service levels gain incremental sales and enhance longterm market penetration we often open new stores near the edge of market areas served by existing stores while these openings may initially have a negative impact on comparable store sales growth we believe this cannibalization strategy increases customer satisfaction and our overall market share by reducing delays in shopping increasing utilization by existing customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations during fiscal 2005 we believe that approximately 20 of our stores were cannibalized by certain of our new stores

we develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and associates these programs including mandatory product knowledge training classes are designed to increase associates knowledge of merchandising departments and products and to educate develop and test the skills of our associates because we primarily promote or relocate current associates to serve as managers and assistant managers for new stores training and assessment of our associates is essential to our growth our district managers and store managers typically meet with our human resources managers to discuss the development of assistant managers and department heads 

we have implemented programs in our stores and divisional offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified associates in a nondiscriminatory way one of the most significant programs we have is our annual human resources review process which assesses and reviews leaders and teams succession planning and executive pipeline high potential associates staffing retention diversity training and compliance the program is closely linked to our performance management process which evaluates the performance leadership and potential of all associates we also maintain a list of qualified associates who are interested in new assignments and of qualified outside applicants that can be reviewed when positions become available

• factory the factory development group ensures all direct import factories are assessed and qualified to manufacture quality products that meet the expectations we have established as well as to assess their compliance with our policies • products the product engineering group authorizes laboratories to test products prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors conduct inspections at the factory to ensure consistent compliance with our requirements applicable national and international standards and features determined by our merchants and • packages the packageengineering group authorizes laboratories to test packaging prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors inspect packaging at the factory to ensure consistent compliance with all relevant requirements logistics we use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase our efficiencies import distribution centers process our globallysourced merchandise at the end of fiscal 2005 we had 16 import distribution centers located in the us and canada at the end of fiscal 2005 we also had 30 lumber distribution centers in the us and canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and

seasonality our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition our business is highly competitive based in part on price store location customer service and depth of merchandise in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in addition to these entities our expo design center stores compete with specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design professionals moreover our home depot supply businesses compete with local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases due to the variety of competition we face we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors we estimate that our share of the us home improvement and professional supply market is approximately 11 and we believe that we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forwardlooking statements made by us related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future those statements may relate to such matters as net sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization commodity price inflation and deflation implementation of store initiatives protection of intellectual property rights net earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense store openings and closures payments on commercial paper borrowings the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital operations after the 

closing of the merger with hughes supply the timing and certainty of closing of the merger with hughes supply the accounting and financial impact of the merger with hughes supply strategic direction and the demand for our products and services all forwardlooking statements by us are qualified by the risks described below these risks are not the only risks we face our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business 

rising costs a reduction in the availability of consumer credit weather and other conditions in north america could adversely affect our costs of doing business demand for our products and services and our average ticket price 

interest rates fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs consumer credit availability weather natural disasters terrorism and other conditions that adversely affect consumer demand for our products and services could adversely affect our financial performance these and other similar factors could 

• increase our costs • cause our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects • cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services and • lead to a decline in average ticket price we rely on third party suppliers and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected 

we buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability the financial instability of suppliers suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control 

if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate us from our competitors 

as part of our strategy of differentiation we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products we may not be able to effectively execute our strategy of differentiation 

any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance 

we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to 

• identify attractive locations • negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms • attract and train qualified employees and • manage preopening expenses including construction costs 10 

our ability to open new stores also will be affected by environmental regulations local zoning issues and other laws related to land use failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance 

the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and our technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our stores and in our administrative functions our technology initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers a better instore experience the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products sales and profit margins 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins 

if we cannot successfully identify and complete acquisition opportunities and integrate the acquired businesses we may be unable to successfully execute our expansion strategy 

the success of our expansion strategy depends in part on our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities complete acquisitions on financially attractive terms and integrate them with our other businesses integration of our acquisitions presents significant challenges and risks to our business including 

• distraction of management from regular business concerns • assimilation and retention of employees and customers of the acquired business • integration of technologies services and products and • achievement of appropriate internal control over financial reporting there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with acquiring and integrating other businesses 

if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets we may not be successful in expanding our international operations 

our expansion strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions strategic alliances and the opening of new stores our ability to successfully execute our expansion strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our us operations in addition our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified associates 

to be successful we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs in addition many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment inventories selfinsurance and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share 

our business is highly competitive based principally on price store location customer service and depth of merchandise in each of the markets we serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent building supply stores and other retailers in addition we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design professionals local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases moreover our home depot supply businesses compete with local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs  

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities with certainty the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations 

changes in the federal state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business in addition changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business

we believe the selected sales data the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations we operate in one operating segment and believe the information presented in our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides an understanding of our operating segment our operations and our financial condition 

 1 fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 refer to the fiscal years ended january 29 2006 january 30 2005 and february 1 2004 respectively fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 include 52 weeks 2 excludes all nonstore locations since their inclusion may cause distortion of the data presented due to operational differences from our retail stores the total number of the excluded locations and their total square footage are immaterial to our total number of locations and total square footage 3 includes net sales at locations open greater than 12 months including relocated and remodeled stores and net sales of all the subsidiaries of the home depot inc stores and subsidiaries become comparable on the monday following their 365 th day of operation and include certain locations acquired in the current year by existing subsidiaries comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales or net earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 22 

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2005 increased 115 to 815 billion from 731 billion for fiscal 2004 fiscal 2005 net sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 38 sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and sales from our newly acquired businesses assuming the acquisition of hughes supply closes in the first quarter of 2006 we expect sales growth of 14 to 17 for fiscal 2006 driven by comparable store sales growth sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 and sales from newly acquired businesses including hughes supply 

the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 reflects a number of factors the retail stores contributed 30 of comparable store sales growth and home depot supply contributed 80 basis points of comparable store sales growth in the retail stores our average ticket which increased 56 to a record 5798 increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2005 was positive in 9 of 10 selling departments building materials had the strongest comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum roofing concrete and insulation due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern us history we experienced strong comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations we also experienced strong comparable store sales in our pro categories including plumbing electrical and hardware in fiscal 2005 the impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales growth 

in order to meet our customer service objectives we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels gain incremental sales and increase market penetration as of the end of fiscal 2005 certain new stores cannibalized approximately 20 of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2005 comparable store sales by approximately 18 additionally we believe that our sales performance has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets however due to the highlyfragmented us home improvement and professional supply industry in which we estimate our market share is approximately 11 measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is extremely difficult 

the growth in net sales for fiscal 2005 reflects growth in services revenue which increased 214 to 43 billion for fiscal 2005 from 36 billion for fiscal 2004 the growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops roofing kitchens windows and hvac we continued to drive our services programs which focus primarily on providing products and services to our doitforme customers we also arrange for the provision of flooring countertop cabinet and window covering installation services to production home builders through our creative touch interiors brand our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging babyboomers as they rely more heavily on installation services 

we continue to invest in our stores to improve store efficiency and the overall customer shopping experience in fiscal 2005 we completed the rollout of our backend automation and reengineering bear project to all stores in the us and canada among other things this initiative improves operational execution and productivity through the automation of our receiving process in the stores enabling us to reallocate resources to the selling floor during fiscal 2005 we continued the implementation or expansion of a number of other instore initiatives we continued the installation of 

selfcheckout registers in 1272 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005 grew our centralized automatic replenishment program commenced vendor certification for certified receiving and implemented an instore special order services initiative pilot in 285 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005 we believe these initiatives will enhance our customers shopping experience as they are fully implemented in our stores 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 118 to 273 billion for fiscal 2005 from 244 billion for fiscal 2004 gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 335 for fiscal 2005 the highest annual rate in our companys history our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 expo stores the increasing penetration of our home depot supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs through our private label credit card we offer no interestno payment programs the deferred interest associated with these programs is included in cost of sales we believe these programs deliver longterm benefits including higher average ticket and customer loyalty for fiscal 2005 the penetration of our private label credit sales was 256 compared to 241 for fiscal 2004 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 88 to 180 billion for fiscal 2005 from 165 billion for fiscal 2004 operating expenses as a percent of net sales were 220 for fiscal 2005 compared to 226 for fiscal 2004 

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased 81 to 165 billion for fiscal 2005 from 153 billion for fiscal 2004 as a percent of net sales sga was 202 for fiscal 2005 compared to 209 for fiscal 2004 the reduction of sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of continued focus on cost takeout initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the company we also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit like bank cards in fiscal 2005 we recorded 52 million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of sga fiscal 2005 was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage and therefore the amount recognized in fiscal 2005 includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program while we expect to continue to recognize gift card breakage in future periods the amounts will be significantly less than in fiscal 2005 due to the onetime multiyear inclusion in fiscal 2005 finally for fiscal 2005 we recorded 91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 expo stores 

depreciation and amortization increased 179 to 15 billion for fiscal 2005 from 12 billion for fiscal 2004 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 18 for fiscal 2005 and 17 for fiscal 2004 the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology 

interest net 

in fiscal 2005 we recognized 81 million of net interest expense compared to 14 million in fiscal 2004 net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 01 for fiscal 2005 and less than 01 for fiscal 2004 interest expense increased to 143 million for fiscal 2005 from 70 million for fiscal 2004 primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the august 2005 10 billion issuance of 4 5  8  senior notes and the september 2004 10 billion issuance of 3 3  4  senior notes interest and investment income increased 107 to 62 million for fiscal 2005 from 56 million for fiscal 2004 due primarily to a higher interest rate environment 

provision for income taxes 

our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to 371 for fiscal 2005 from 368 for fiscal 2004 the majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajc act provides a onetime 85 dividendsreceived deduction that applies to qualified cash dividends received from controlled foreign corporations if the funds are reinvested in the united states the deduction can result in an effective income tax rate of 525 on the repatriation of foreign earnings a rate much lower than the normal statutory tax rate of 35 the company has determined that it will not repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the ajc act 

the ajc act also provides a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities when fully phasedin the deduction will be up to 9 of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income because this provision is targeted toward manufacturing activities the company does not expect to recognize a material benefit in the current or future tax years 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 272 and 226 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our 110 billion repurchase authorization over the past four fiscal years we have repurchased approximately 277 million shares of our common stock for a total of 97 billion on february 23 2006 our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion for share repurchases bringing our total authorization to 120 billion in fiscal 2006 we estimate diluted earnings per share growth of 10 to 14 

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal year ended february 1 2004 fiscal 2003 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2004 increased 128 to 731 billion from 648 billion for fiscal 2003 fiscal 2004 net sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 54 sales from the 183 net new stores opened during fiscal 2004 sales from the 175 net new stores opened during fiscal 2003 and sales from our newly acquired businesses 

the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2004 reflects a number of factors our average ticket which increased 73 to 5489 increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2004 was positive in all selling departments we experienced strong comparable store sales increases in building materials due in part to the impact of several hurricanes in the southeastern us lumber was another strong category during fiscal 2004 driven primarily by commodity price inflation additionally we had strong sales growth in our kitchen and bath categories driven by appliances bath fixtures vanities and sinks finally our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of cannibalization as of the end of fiscal 2004 certain new stores cannibalized approximately 17 of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2004 comparable store sales by approximately 22 

the growth in net sales for fiscal 2004 reflects growth in services revenue which increased 28 to 36 billion for fiscal 2004 from 28 billion for fiscal 2003 driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops hvac kitchens and our flooring companies 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 187 to 244 billion for fiscal 2004 from 206 billion for fiscal 2003 an increase of 167 basis points gross profit as a percent of net sales was 334 for fiscal 2004 compared to 318 for fiscal 2003 the adoption of emerging issues task force 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 0216 reduced our cost of sales by coop advertising allowances of 891 million or 122 basis points in fiscal 2004 and 40 million or 6 basis points in fiscal 2003 see section impact of the adoption of eitf 0216 excluding the impact of the adoption of eitf 0216 our gross profit as a percent of net sales would have been 322 for fiscal 2004 compared with 317 for fiscal 2003 improved inventory management which resulted in lower shrink levels contributed 18 basis points of our increase in gross profit finally 33 basis points resulted from benefits arising from a change in merchandising mix offset by the cost of our deferred interest programs 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 202 to 165 billion for fiscal 2004 from 137 billion for fiscal 2003 operating expenses as a percent of net sales were 226 for fiscal 2004 compared to 212 for fiscal 2003 

sga increased 200 to 153 billion for fiscal 2004 from 127 billion for fiscal 2003 as a percent of net sales sga was 209 for fiscal 2004 compared to 196 for fiscal 2003 the increase in sga in fiscal 2004 includes 10 billion of advertising expense related to the adoption of eitf 0216 excluding the impact of eitf 0216 sga increased 122 to 143 billion or 195 of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared with 196 of net sales in fiscal 2003 the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2004 excluding the impact of eitf 0216 was due to an increase in labor productivity and benefits from our private label credit card which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit like bank cards labor productivity as measured by sales per labor hour reached an alltime high in fiscal 2004 as we moved our associates from tasking to selling activities this reduction in costs was partially offset by higher expenses associated with incentive programs like our success sharing program and our management incentive plan and stockbased compensation expense in addition our planned investment in store modernization and technology caused remodel and repair expenses to rise at a faster rate than our net sales growth 

depreciation and amortization increased 222 to 12 billion for fiscal 2004 from 10 billion for fiscal 2003 depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 17 for fiscal 2004 and 16 for fiscal 2003 the increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our investment in store modernization and technology 

interest net 

in fiscal 2004 we recognized 14 million of net interest expense compared to 3 million in fiscal 2003 net interest expense as a percent of net sales was less than 01 for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 interest expense increased 129 to 70 million for fiscal 2004 from 62 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in outstanding indebtedness and a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest interest expense also increased due to the addition of 38 million in capital leases during the year interest and investment income decreased 51 to 56 million for fiscal 2004 from 59 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to a lower interest rate environment 

provision for income taxes 

our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to 368 for fiscal 2004 from 371 for fiscal 2003 the majority of this reduction was due to the reversal of a 31 million valuation 

allowance as we were able to recognize previous capital losses for which no tax benefit had been recorded at the time the capital loss was incurred 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 226 and 188 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively the adoption of eitf 0216 negatively impacted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 by 004 per share diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 

impact of the adoption of eitf 0216 

in fiscal 2003 we adopted eitf 0216 which states that certain cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendors products or services and should therefore be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendors products or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor we receive consideration in the form of advertising coop allowances from our vendors pursuant to annual agreements which are generally on a calendar year basis as permitted by eitf 0216 we elected to apply its provisions prospectively to all agreements entered into or modified after december 31 2002 therefore the impact of us adopting eitf 0216 in fiscal 2003 was limited to advertising coop allowances earned pursuant to vendor agreements entered into in late 2003 which became effective in january 2004 

the onemonth impact of the adoption of eitf 0216 in fiscal 2003 resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of 40 million an increase in sga of 47 million and a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of 7 million the impact on our diluted earnings per share was immaterial 

the impact of the adoption of eitf 0216 in fiscal 2004 resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of 891 million an increase in sga of 10 billion and a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of 158 million the impact on our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 was a reduction of 004 per share 

eitf 0216 did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2005 consolidated results of operations or financial condition as of january 29 2006 

prior to the adoption of eitf 0216 in fiscal 2003 the entire amount of advertising coop allowances received was offset against advertising expense and resulted in a reduction of sga we continue to earn certain advertising coop allowances that are recorded as an offset against advertising expenses as they are reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 net advertising expense was 11 billion 10 billion and 58 million respectively which was recorded in sga 

the following table illustrates the fullyear effect on cost of sales gross profit sga operating income and diluted earnings per share as if advertising coop allowances had always been treated as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with eitf 0216 amounts in millions except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity for fiscal 2005 net cash provided by operating activities was 65 billion as compared to 69 billion for fiscal 2004 the decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in deferred income taxes resulting from the reversal of certain temporary differences and no increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by stronger net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 46 billion for fiscal 2005 from 45 billion for fiscal 2004 this increase was due to an increase in payments for businesses acquired partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from sales maturities and purchases of investments we paid 25 billion to complete 21 acquisitions in fiscal 2005 primarily adding professional service capabilities to home depot supply in january 2006 we announced our intent to acquire hughes supply for aggregate consideration of 35 billion we expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

additionally in fiscal 2005 we had 39 billion of capital expenditures allocated as follows 66 for new stores 10 for store modernization 9 for technology and 15 for other initiatives in fiscal 2005 we opened 179 new stores including five relocations 

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2005 was 16 billion compared with 31 billion for fiscal 2004 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of 10 billion of longterm debt in august 2005 and 900 million of shortterm debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 under our commercial paper program in may 2005 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the future issuance of up to 50 billion of debt securities in august 2005 we issued 10 billion of 4 5  8  senior notes see note 3 in notes to consolidated financial statements at a discount of 5 million the net proceeds of 995 million were used to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of national waterworks commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 supported shortterm liquidity needs 

in february 2005 and august 2005 our board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion and 10 billion respectively in our share repurchase program bringing the total authorization by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2002 to 110 billion as of january 29 2006 pursuant to this authorization we have repurchased approximately 277 million shares of our common stock for a total of 97 billion as of january 29 2006 during fiscal 2005 we repurchased approximately 76 million shares of our common stock for 30 billion and during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock for 31 billion as of january 29 2006 approximately 13 billion remained under our previously authorized share repurchase program subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005 our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion bringing the total authorization since the inception of the share repurchase program to 120 billion during fiscal 2005 we also increased dividends paid by 192 to 857 million from 719 million in fiscal 2004 

we have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to a maximum of 25 billion in connection with the program we have a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 20 billion as of january 29 2006 there was 900 million outstanding under the program we expect to repay this amount during the first quarter of 2006 the credit facility which expires in december 2010 contains various restrictions none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 

we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate including our stores distribution centers and store support centers the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in longterm debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 2005 our longterm debttoequity ratio was 99 compared to 89 at the end of fiscal 2004 this increase reflects the net increase in longterm debt as a result of the august 2005 issuance of 4 5  8  senior notes due august 15 2010 

as of january 29 2006 we had 807 million in cash and shortterm investments we believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required longterm debt payments through the next several fiscal years in addition we have funds available from the 25 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for future acquisitions and other requirements in march 2006 we used the remaining availability under our shelf registration statement to issue 10 billion of 520 senior notes due march 1 2011 and 30 billion of 540 senior notes due march 1 2016 we intend to use the proceeds to fund our pending acquisition of hughes supply and to refinance our 500 million of 5 3  8  senior notes due april 1 2006 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 29 2006 amounts in millions 





1 contractual obligations include shortterm debt longterm debt comprised primarily of 25 billion of senior notes further discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business the amounts listed do not include aggregate consideration of 35 billion related to our pending acquisition of hughes supply expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 or any debt issued subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005 2 excludes present value of capital lease obligations of 381 million includes 479 million of interest payments and 8 million of unamortized discount 3 includes 867 million of imputed interest 4 commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets we issue letters of credit for insurance programs purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services 5 purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases utility purchases capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above additionally we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an offbalance sheet lease related to certain stores for 282 million during 2008 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 

as of january 29 2006 we had net of discounts 996 million of 4 5  8  senior notes 996 million of 3 3  4  senior notes and 500 million of 5 3  8  senior notes outstanding the market values of the publicly traded 4 5  8  3 3  4  and 5 3  8  senior notes as of january 29 2006 were approximately 985 million 976 million and 500 million respectively we have several outstanding interest rate 

swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 475 million that swap fixed rate interest on our 500 million 5 3  8  senior notes for variable interest rates equal to libor plus 30 to 245 basis points and expire on april 1 2006 at january 29 2006 the fair market value of these agreements was a liability of 1 million which is the estimated amount that we would have paid to settle similar interest rate agreements at current interest rates 

impact of inflation deflation and changing prices 

we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products during fiscal 2005 lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately 13 basis points we do not believe that changing prices for other commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations although we cannot accurately determine the precise overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of estimated returns at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels the methodology used is consistent with other retailers we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns however if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts our sales could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 

merchandise inventories 

our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market with approximately 86 valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method retailers like the home depot with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the company as of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 

independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store distribution center and home depot supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a storebystore basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the 

difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods among other things we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability product liability automobile workers compensation and medical claims our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by management and thirdparty actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity or frequency of claims medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r this statement revises sfas statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas 123r requires all public entities to recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments as measured by the fair value on the grant date over the requisite service period in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission issued guidance delaying the effective date of sfas 123r therefore it will now be effective for the home depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

effective february 3 2003 we adopted the fair value based method of recording stockbased compensation expense in accordance with sfas 123 we selected the prospective method of adoption as described in sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure and accordingly stockbased compensation expense was recorded for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the beginning of fiscal 2003 historically we have used the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees sfas 123r requires that all sharebased payments granted prior to the adoption date that remain unvested at the adoption date also be expensed over the remaining service period we currently intend to adopt sfas 123r using the modifiedprospective method therefore in addition to continuing to recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased payments awarded since our adoption of sfas 123 in fiscal 2003 we will also begin expensing unvested options granted prior to 2003 upon the adoption of sfas 123r we currently estimate the impact of adopting sfas 123r will be a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of approximately 40 million for fiscal 2006 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp 131 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 131 fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations fsp 131 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2005 and will therefore be effective for the home depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the adoption of fsp 131 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

retail businesses 

home depot stores 

operating strategy the operating strategy of home depot is to offer a broad assortment of highquality merchandise and services at competitive prices using knowledgeable serviceoriented personnel and strong marketing and credit promotions we believe that our associates knowledge of products and home improvement techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our ability to maintain and enhance customer satisfaction 

customers home depot stores serve three primary customer groups 

• doityourself diy customers these customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations to complement the expertise of our associates home depot stores offer howto clinics taught by associates and merchandise vendors • doitforme difm customers these customers are typically homeowners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project andor installation we arrange for the installation of a variety of home depot products through qualified independent contractors 2 

• professional customers these customers are professional remodelers general contractors repairmen and tradesmen in many stores we offer a variety of programs to these customers including additional delivery and willcall services dedicated staff extensive merchandise selections and expanded credit programs all of which we believe increase sales to this group products a typical home depot store stocks 40000 to 50000 products during the year including both national brand name and proprietary items the following table shows the percentage of revenues of each major product group and related services for each of the last three fiscal years 

 we buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world we are not dependent on any single supplier most of our merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers which eliminates middleman costs we believe that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all of the products we sell in home depot stores 

to complement and enhance our product selection we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names during fiscal 2004 we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including but not limited to john deere® lawn and garden tractors thomasville® kitchen and bathroom cabinets silestone® countertops ridgid® power tools behr premium plus® paint mills pride® cabinets husky® hand tools ge smartwater™ water heaters philips® light bulbs toro® lawn mowers vigoro® lawn care products gaf® roofing products honda® lawn mowers and lithonia lighting™ fluorescent lighting products we may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to the home depot 

we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source highquality products directly from manufacturers this gives our customers a broader selection of innovative products and better value while enhancing our gross margin our product development merchants travel internationally to identify opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores additionally we have two sourcing offices located in shanghai and shenzhen china and have a product development merchant located in bonn germany we also have product development merchants as well as a sourcing office in monterrey mexico these initiatives enable us to improve product features and quality to import products not currently available to our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would otherwise be available if purchased from thirdparty importers we currently source products from more than 600 factories in approximately 35 countries 

services home depot stores offer a variety of installation services these services target difm customers who select and purchase materials for a project and then arrange for professional installation through the company our installed sales programs use only qualified independent contractors throughout the us and canada these programs include the installation of products that are sold in our stores such as carpeting flooring cabinets water heaters and countertops as well as other products such as generators and furnace and central air systems 

storerelated programs we continually assess our business to find opportunities to increase customer loyalty thereby increasing sales accordingly we implemented or expanded a number of instore initiatives in home depot stores and programs aimed at supporting store operations during fiscal 2004 including 

• professional business customer initiative  we are committed to being the supplier of choice to a variety of professional customers including remodelers carpenters plumbers painters electricians building maintenance professionals and designers during fiscal 2004 we continued to expand our pro initiative which adds servicerelated programs to our stores that are designed to increase sales to professional customers stores participating in the program have added associates at a sales desk dedicated to providing more personalized service to professional customers including managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pickup or delivery additionally during the hours when professionals typically shop these stores have assigned sales associates in certain departments to better assist these customers we have also increased the available quantities of products typically purchased by professionals in bulk and we offer certain items in each department packaged in bulk to provide additional savings while aimed at the professional customer this program also enables us to provide diy customers with improved customer service including delivery and willcall services expanded credit programs and additional merchandise through this initiative we have identified best practices in serving our professional customers that are being implemented in many of our stores without material additional costs by the end of fiscal 2004 we had expanded the pro initiative into 1563 stores 207 of which were added during the year we anticipate that during fiscal 2005 we will expand this initiative to approximately 165 additional stores including new stores • appliance sales  during fiscal 2004 we continued the rollout of our appliance sales program on our web site and throughout our stores in the us through this program we sell appliances manufactured by general electric® maytag® and other leading manufacturers we display and stock the more popular appliances in our stores and offer the ability to special order approximately 2300 additional products through computer kiosks located in stores through the computer kiosks we can check inventory and arrange for delivery to the customer directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the order is placed appliance showrooms were in 1787 of our stores at the end of fiscal 2004 and we anticipate adding the appliance sales program to an additional 165 stores by the end of fiscal 2005 • designplace initiative  we continued to implement our designplace® initiative during fiscal 2004 rolling the initiative out to an additional 162 stores and bringing the total to 1787 stores at the end of fiscal 2004 from 1625 stores at the end of fiscal 2003 this initiative offers an enhanced shopping experience to our design and décor customers by providing personalized service from speciallytrained associates and enhanced merchandise selection in an attractive setting we expect to add the designplace initiative to 165 additional stores during fiscal 2005 • tool rental centers  as part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range of the needs of our professional and diy customers we offer a tool rental center in certain stores we rent approximately 350 commercialquality tools and equipment in 12 categories including saws floor sanders generators gas powered lawn equipment and plumbing tools customers can rent the tools on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis our associates who work in the tool rental center receive special training in the use and maintenance of tools at the end of fiscal 2004 we had tool rental centers in 1061 stores compared to 825 stores at the end of fiscal 2003 by the end of fiscal 2005 we anticipate having tool rental centers in approximately 1186 stores we believe that offering this service increases the sales of related merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment similar to that available for rental • customer contact center  since fiscal 2001 we have had a customer contact center to assist with expediting special orders and managing installation projects the customer contact center also 4 

supports the sale and installation of roofing siding windows water heaters gutters fencing and hvac equipment nationwide calls come into the center where customer service representatives assist customers with product selection and scheduling installations the orders are then fulfilled through our stores or by thirdparty service providers during 2005 we anticipate opening an additional customer contact center to support approximately 500750 additional stores we believe that customer contact centers help us provide better customer service both in our stores and on the phone while reducing costs 

• customer education programs  we offer several programs to enhance the skills of our diy customers our associates and vendors teach howto clinics that focus on diy projects such as installing garbage disposals laying patio pavers or building a deck in addition to the clinics we offer home depot university® which presents fourweek modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets of a home improvement topic for example a room enhancement module may provide instruction on paint wallpaper and window treatments through the home depots kids workshop sm program children are instructed in tool safety and complete a small building project such as a birdhouse or tool box we believe that these types of educational programs increase our sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our position as experts in home improvement store growth 

united states  at the end of fiscal 2004 we were operating 1657 home depot stores in the united states including the territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands during fiscal 2004 we opened 142 new home depot stores in the us although these new store openings occurred primarily in existing markets we continued our geographic expansion by opening stores in a number of new markets 

to increase customer service levels gain incremental sales and enhance longterm market penetration we often open new stores near the edge of market areas served by existing stores while these openings may initially have a negative impact on comparable store sales growth we believe this cannibalization strategy increases customer satisfaction and our overall market share by reducing delays in shopping increasing utilization by existing customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations at the end of fiscal 2004 we believe that approximately 17 of our stores were cannibalized by certain new stores 

canada  at the end of fiscal 2004 we were operating 117 home depot stores in nine canadian provinces of these stores 15 were opened during fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2005 we plan to open 19 additional stores in canada

china  at the end of 2004 the company entered into an arrangement to lease commercial space in shanghai to support a retail initiative in china the company is currently pursuing its strategy for entry into the china home improvement marketplace 

expo design center stores 

operating strategy the operating strategy behind our expo design center stores is to be a complete home decorating and remodeling resource each store offers 12 specialty businesses under one roof and features design showrooms with fullsize displays to help customers visualize the end result of interior design projects to assist our customers we also offer complete project management and installation services accordingly we employ associates who have expertise in designing planning and completing decorating and remodeling projects

not dependent on any single vendor most of our merchandise is purchased
directly from manufacturers which eliminates middleman costs we believe
that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all
of the products we sell in home depot stores

products directly from overseas manufacturers which gives our customers a
broader selection of products and better values while enhancing our gross
margin our product development merchants travel internationally to identify
opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores additionally we have
opened two sourcing offices located in shanghai and shenzhen china and have a
product development merchant located in bonn germany these initiatives enable
us to improve product quality to import products not currently available to
our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would otherwise be
available if purchased from thirdparty importers we currently source products
from more than 500 factories in approximately 40 countries

to complement and enhance our current product selection we have formed
strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to
market products under a variety of wellrecognized brand names at the end of
fiscal year 2002 we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands
including but not limited to john deerer lawn and garden tractors

                  kiosks located in the stores through the computer kiosks we
                  can check inventory and arrange for delivery to the customer
                  directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the

                 designplace initiative we continued to implement our
                  designplace initiative during fiscal 2002 rolling the
                  initiative out to an additional 668 stores the initiative
                  offers an enhanced shopping experience to our design and
                  decor customers by providing personalized service from
                  specially trained associates and enhanced merchandise
                  selection in an attractive setting we expect to add the
                  designplace initiative to an additional 556 stores during
                  fiscal 2003

                 tool rental as part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range
                  of the needs of our professional and diy customers we
                  offer a tool rental service in certain stores under this
                  program we rent approximately 200 commercialquality tools
                  in ten categories including saws floor sanders generators
                  gas powered lawn equipment and plumbing tools customers can
                  rent the tools on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis
                  our associates who work in the tool rental area receive
                  special training in the use and maintenance of the tools at
                  the end of fiscal 2002 we offered tool rental service in 601
                  stores compared to 466 stores at the end of fiscal 2001 by
                  the end of fiscal 2003 we anticipate having tool rental
                  services in approximately 800 stores we believe that
                  offering this service increases the sales of related
                  merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment similar
                  to that available for rental

                 customer contact center during fiscal 2001 we began testing
                  the use of a customer contact center to assist with
                  expediting special orders and managing installation projects
                  the customer contact center also supports the sale and
                  installation of water heaters and hvac equipment nationwide
                  calls come into the center where customer service
                  representatives assist customers with product selection and
                  scheduling installations the orders are then fulfilled
                  through our stores we believe that the customer contact
                  center will allow us to provide better customer service both
                  in our stores and on the phone while reducing costs we
                  anticipate continuing this test during fiscal 2003

                 customer education programs we offer several programs to
                  enhance the skills and confidence of our diy customers our
                  associates and vendors teach howto clinics that focus on
                  diy projects such as installing garbage disposals laying
                  patio pavers or building a deck in addition to the clinics
                  we offer home depot universitysm which presents fourweek
                  modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets
                  of a home improvement topic for example a room enhancement
                  module may provide instruction on paint wallpaper and window
                  treatments through the home depots kids workshopsm
                  program children are instructed in tool safety and complete a
                  small building project such as a birdhouse or tool box we
                  believe that these types of educational programs increase our
                  sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects
                  differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our
                  position as experts in home improvement

store growth

united states at the end of fiscal 2002 we were operating 1370 home depot
stores in the united states including puerto rico during fiscal 2002 we
opened 167 new home depot stores in the us although these new store openings
occurred primarily in existing markets we continued our geographic expansion
by opening stores in a number of new markets

to increase customer service levels gain incremental sales and enhance
longterm market penetration we often open new stores near the edge of market
areas served by existing stores while these openings may initially have a
negative impact on comparable storeforstore sales we believe this
cannibalization strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market
share by reducing delays in shopping increasing utilization by existing
customers and attracting new customers to more

six transit facilities in fiscal 2003 the transit facility network will
provide service to all stores in the continental united states and to eastern
canada by the end of 2003 we also operate other specialty distribution centers
for specific merchandise needs the distribution centers and transit facilities
allow us to provide high service levels to our stores at relatively low costs
at the end of fiscal 2002 approximately 30 of the merchandise shipped to our
stores was processed through our network of distribution centers and transit
facilities as our networks evolve we expect to increase the percent of
merchandise processed by our facilities the remaining merchandise will be
shipped directly from our vendors to our stores

delivery services directly to our customers we continually assess
opportunities to improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs
of our stores and our customers and to lower costs

competition our business is highly competitive based in part on price store
location customer service and depth of merchandise in each of the markets we
serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical
plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to
some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and
national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent
building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in addition to
these entities our expo design center stores also compete with specialty
design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design
professionals due to the variety of competition we face we are unable to
precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors we estimate that
our share of the home improvement industry is approximately 10 and we believe
that we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets

storerelated programs we continually assess our business to find opportunities

                  programs to our stores that are designed to increase sales to
                  professional customers stores participating in the program

                  managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pickup or
                  delivery additionally during the hours when professionals
                  typically shop these stores have assigned sales associates in
                  certain departments to assist these customers to better serve
                  our professional customers we have also increased quantities
                  of existing products typically purchased by professionals in
                  bulk quantities and we offer certain items in each department
                  packaged in bulk to offer additional savings while aimed at
                  the professional customer this program also enables us to
                  better serve our diy customer with improved customer
                  service including delivery and willcall services expanded
                  credit programs and additional merchandise through this
                  initiative we have identified best practices in serving our
                  professional customers that are being implemented in many of
                  our stores without material additional costs by the end of
                  fiscal 2001 we had expanded the professional customer
                  initiative into approximately 535 stores 370 of which were
                  added during the year we anticipate that during fiscal 2002
                  we will expand this initiative to more than 400 additional
                  stores

                 spi program during fiscal 2001 we completed the rollout of
                  our service performance improvement or spi program the
                  program focuses on making it easier to shop in our stores
                  while improving customer service through the program some
                  associates are assigned specific tasks allowing others to
                  focus on assisting customers additionally we schedule
                  associates to receive shipments and stock merchandise when our
                  stores are closed or during hours when they have fewer
                  customers we believe this separation of assignments allows us
                  to provide better customer service while improving labor
                  productivity increasing transportation and receiving
                  efficiencies managing inventory more efficiently and
                  increasing sales

                 centralization of merchandising during fiscal 2001 we
                  centralized our merchandise buying decisions and vendor
                  selection processes while retaining merchandising groups in
                  our divisions in order to support the development of
                  neighborhood store product assortments this structure
                  allows us to leverage the purchasing power of the company
                  while focusing on the needs of individual neighborhoods and
                  to develop product mixes to satisfy neighborhood buying
                  preferences additionally through centralized buying we
                  believe we can more effectively manage our product assortments
                  and our pricing strategy

                 appliance sales during fiscal 2000 we completed the rollout
                  of our appliance sales program to most of our stores in the
                  us through this program we sell appliances manufactured by
                  general electricr maytagr and other manufacturers we
                  display and stock the more popular appliances in our stores
                  and offer the ability to special order over 2000 additional
                  products through computer kiosks located in the stores
                  through the computer kiosks we can check inventory and arrange
                  for delivery to the customer directly from the manufacturer as
                  soon as 48 hours after the order is placed during fiscal
                  2002 we plan to continue to test an enhanced offering of
                  appliances through 1500 to 2000 feet of dedicated appliance
                  selling space in selected stores about 50 of our stores had
                  appliance showrooms at the end of fiscal 2001 and we
                  anticipate adding them to up to 350 stores during fiscal 2002

                 tool rental as part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range
                  of the needs of our professional and diy customers we offer
                  a tool rental service in certain stores under this program
                  we rent approximately 200 commercialquality tools in ten
                  categories including saws floor sanders generators gas
                  powered lawn equipment and plumbing tools customers can rent
                  the tools on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis our
                  associates who work in the tool rental area receive special
                  training concerning the use and maintenance of the tools as
                  of february 3 2002 we offered tool rental service in
                  approximately 466 stores compared to 342 stores at the end of
                  fiscal 2000 by the end of fiscal 2002 we anticipate having
                  tool rental services in approximately 600 stores we believe
                  that offering this service increases the sales of related
                  merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment similar to
                  that available for rental

                 customer contact center during fiscal 2001 we began testing
                  the use of a customer contact center to answer calls to
                  stores in addition to handling store calls the contact
                  center representatives assist with expediting special orders
                  and managing installation projects the customer contact
                  center also supports the sale and installation of water
                  heaters and hvac equipment nationwide calls come into the
                  center where customer service representatives assist customers
                  with product selection and scheduling installations the
                  orders are then fulfilled through our stores we believe that
                  the customer contact center will allow us to provide better
                  customer service both in our stores and on the phone while
                  reducing costs we anticipate continuing this test during
                  fiscal 2002

                 customer education programs we offer several programs to
                  enhance the skills and confidence of our diy customers our
                  associates and vendors teach howto clinics that focus on
                  diy projects such as installing garbage disposals laying
                  patio pavers or building a deck in addition to the clinics
                  we offer home depot universitysm which presents fourweek
                  modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets
                  of a home improvement topic for example a room enhancement
                  module may provide instruction on paint wallpaper and window
                  treatments through the home depots kids workshopsm
                  program children are instructed in tool safety and complete a
                  small building project such as a birdhouse or tool box we
                  believe that these types of educational programs increase our
                  sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects
                  differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our
                  position as experts in home improvement

store growth

united states at the end of fiscal 2001 we were operating 1201 home depot

market areas served by existing stores


                                       6

were cannibalized by new store openings

canada we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers by using
national advertising at the same time we tailor the majority of our
advertising locally to respond to market differences both in terms of products
and the competitive environment

facilities in the united states and canada to support the lumber demands of our
stores we also operated three transit facilities at the end of 2001 at these
facilities we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately cross dock
it onto trucks for delivery to our stores as our store density increases we
plan to continue adding transit facilities up to a nationwide network of 1520
facilities the distribution centers and transit facilities allow us to provide
high service levels to our stores at relatively low costs our current plans
call for seven additional transit facilities in fiscal 2002

in addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores we also provide
delivery services directly to our customers we continually assess opportunities
to improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs of our stores
and our customers and to lower costs

associates our safety department consists of a team of directors and managers
in the field focused primarily on education and training as well as an
atlantabased team of dedicated safety professionals who evaluate and implement
policies and processes companywide the goal of the safety department is to

yards with respect to some products we also compete with discount stores
local regional and national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs
independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in
addition to these entities our expo design center stores also compete with
specialty design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior
design professionals due to the variety of competition we face we are unable
to precisely measure our market share in existing market areas we believe that
we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets

results of operations

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance
during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to
consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report

fiscal year ended february 3 2002 compared to january 28 2001 fiscal year
2001 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2000 net sales for
fiscal 2001 increased 171 to 536 billion from 457 billion in fiscal 2000
this increase was attributable to among other things the 204 new stores opened
during fiscal 2001 and full year sales from the 204 new stores opened during
fiscal 2000 approximately 880 million of the increase in sales was
attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2001 comparable storeforstore
sales were flat in fiscal 2001 due to the weak economic environment resulting
from certain factors including but not limited to low consumer confidence and
high unemployment


                                       19

gross profit as a percent of sales was 302 for fiscal 2001 compared to 299
for fiscal 2000 the rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost of
merchandise resulting from product line reviews purchasing synergies created by
our newly centralized merchandising structure and an increase in the number of
tool rental centers from 342 at the end of fiscal 2000 to 466 at the end of
fiscal 2001 we expect to have tool rental centers in approximately 600 stores
by the end of fiscal 2002

operating expenses as a percent of sales were 209 for fiscal 2001 compared to
207 for fiscal 2000 selling and store operating expenses as a percent of
sales increased to 190 in fiscal 2001 from 186 in fiscal 2000 the increase
was primarily attributable to growth in store occupancy costs resulting from
higher depreciation and property taxes due to our investment in new stores
combined with increased energy costs also credit card transaction fees were
higher than the prior year due to increased penetration of total credit sales
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in store payroll expense
caused by an improvement in labor productivity resulting from initiatives inside
the store and new systems enhancements

store initiatives include our service performance improvement spi initiative
which was implemented in every home depot store in fiscal 2001 under spi our
stores receive and handle inventory at night allowing our associates to spend
more time with customers during peak selling hours in addition our pro program
was in 535 of our home depot stores at the end of fiscal 2001 providing
dedicated store resources to serve the specific needs of professional customers
we expect to have our pro initiative in more than 950 stores at the end of
fiscal 2002 spi and pro have resulted in improved operational efficiency
safety and customer service

preopening expenses as a percent of sales were 02 for fiscal 2001 and 03
for fiscal 2000 we opened 204 new stores in both fiscal 2001 and 2000
preopening expenses averaged 569000 per store in fiscal 2001 compared to
671000 per store in fiscal 2000 the decrease in the average expense per store
was primarily due to shorter preopening periods as we reengineered our store
opening process

general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 17 for fiscal
2001 compared to 18 in fiscal 2000 this decrease was primarily due to cost
savings associated with the reorganization of certain components of our general
and administrative structure such as the centralization of our merchandising
organization and our focus on expense control in areas such as travel

interest and investment income as a percent of sales was 01 for both fiscal
2001 and 2000 interest expense as a percent of sales was 01 for both fiscal
2001 and 2000

our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to 386 for
fiscal 2001 from 388 for fiscal 2000 the decrease in fiscal 2001 was
attributable to higher tax credits and a lower effective state income tax rate
compared to fiscal 2000

net earnings as a percent of sales were 57 for fiscal 2001 compared to 56
for fiscal 2000 reflecting the increased gross profit rate which was partially
offset by higher store operating expenses as described above diluted earnings
per share were 129 for fiscal 2001 compared to 110 for fiscal 2000

fiscal year ended january 28 2001 compared to january 30 2000 net sales for
fiscal 2000 increased 190 to 457 billion from 384 billion in fiscal 1999
this increase was attributable to among other things full year sales from the
169 new stores opened during fiscal 1999 a 4 comparable storeforstore sales
increase and 204 new store openings

gross profit as a percent of sales was 299 for fiscal 2000 compared to 297
for fiscal 1999 the rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost of
merchandise resulting from product line reviews benefits from global sourcing
programs and an increase in the number of tool rental centers from 150 at the
end of fiscal 1999 to 342 at the end of fiscal 2000

operating expenses as a percent of sales were 207 for fiscal 2000 compared to
198 for fiscal 1999 selling and store operating expenses as a percent of
sales increased to 186 in fiscal 2000 from 178 in fiscal 1999 the increase
was primarily attributable to higher store selling payroll expenses resulting
from market wage pressures and an increase in employee longevity in addition
medical costs increased due to higher family enrollment in our medical plans
rising health care costs and higher prescription drug costs finally store
occupancy costs including property taxes property rent depreciation and
utilities increased due to new store growth and energy rate increases

preopening expenses as a percent of sales were 03 for both fiscal 2000 and
1999 we opened 204 new stores in fiscal 2000 compared to opening 169 new
stores in fiscal 1999 preopening expenses averaged 671000 per store in
fiscal 2000 compared to 643000 per store in fiscal 1999 the higher average
expense was primarily due to the opening of more expo design center stores and
expansion of home depot stores into certain new markets including international
locations which involved longer preopening periods and higher training travel
and relocation costs

general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 18 for fiscal
2000 compared to 17 for fiscal 1999 the increase was primarily due to
investments in internet development and international operations as well as a
full year of payroll and other costs associated with operating four new
divisional offices which opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999

interest and investment income as a percent of sales was 01 for both fiscal
2000 and 1999 interest expense as a percent of sales was 01 for both
comparable periods

our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to 388 for
fiscal 2000 from 390 for fiscal 1999 the decrease was attributable to higher
tax credits in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

net earnings as a percent of sales were 56 for fiscal 2000 compared to 60
for fiscal 1999 reflecting higher selling and store operating expenses as a
percent of sales partially offset by a higher gross profit rate as described
above diluted earnings per share were 110 for fiscal 2000 compared to 100
for fiscal 1999

liquidity and capital resources

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of
liquidity for fiscal 2001 cash provided by operations increased to 60
billion from 28 billion in fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily due to
significant growth in days payable outstanding from 23 days at the end of fiscal
2000 to 34 days at the end of fiscal 2001 a 127 decrease in average inventory
per store as of the end of fiscal 2001 and increased operating income the
growth in days payable and decrease in average inventory per store are the
result of our efforts to improve our working capital position by extending our
payment terms to industry standards and enhancing inventory assortments

cash used in investing activities primarily comprised of capital expenditures
was 35 billion in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 we opened 204 new stores in both
fiscal 2001 and 2000 we own 188 of the stores opened in 2001 and lease the
remainder

we plan to open 200 stores in fiscal 2002 and expect total capital expenditures
to be approximately 36 billion

cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2001 was 173 million compared with
cash provided by financing activities of 737 million in fiscal 2000 the
increase in cash used was primarily due to the net effect of repaying 754
million of commercial paper and issuing 500 million of 5 38 senior notes
during fiscal 2001

we have a commercial paper program that allows borrowings up to a maximum of 1
billion as of february 3 2002 there were no borrowings outstanding under the
program in connection with the program we have a backup credit facility with
a consortium of banks for up to 800 million the credit facility which expires
in september 2004 contains various restrictive covenants none of which are
expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources

we use capital operating and other offbalance sheet leases to finance about
20 of our real estate offbalance sheet leases include three leases created
under structured financing arrangements to fund the construction of certain
stores office buildings and distribution centers two of these lease agreements
involve a special purpose entity which meets the criteria established by
generally accepted accounting principles and is not owned by or affiliated with
the company its management or officers operating and offbalance sheet leases
are not reflected in our balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles the net present value of capital lease obligations is
reflected in our balance sheet in longterm debt as of the end of fiscal 2001
our debt to equity ratio was 69 if the estimated present value of future
payments under the operating and other offbalance sheet leases were
capitalized our debt to equity ratio would increase to approximately 30

1      contractual obligations consist of longterm debt comprised primarily
         of 1 billion of senior notes further discussed in quantitative and
         qualitative disclosures about market risk and future minimum lease
         payments under capital and operating leases including offbalance
         sheet leases used in the normal course of business

2      commercial commitments include letters of credit for certain business
         transactions and guarantees provided under certain offbalance sheet
         leases we issue letters of credit for insurance programs import
         purchases and construction contracts under certain offbalance sheet
         leases for retail locations office buildings and distribution centers
         we have provided residual value guarantees the estimated maximum
         amount of the residual value guarantees at the end of the lease terms
         is 799 million the leases expire at various terms from 2004 through
         2008 with some carrying renewal options through 2025 the expiration
         date of the residual value guarantees in the table above is based on
         the original lease terms however the expiration period will change if
         the leases are renewed

as of february 3 2002 we had 25 billion in cash and cash equivalents we
believe that our current cash position internally generated funds funds
available from the 1 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain
alternate sources of financing should be sufficient to enable us to complete our
capital expenditure programs through the next several fiscal years

impact of inflation and changing prices

although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on
operations we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on sales or
results of operations

critical accounting policies

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical
accounting policies which are those that are most important to the portrayal of
our financial condition and results and that require judgment

revenue recognition we recognize revenue net of estimated returns at the time
the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services we
estimate the liability for sales returns based on the historical return levels
the methodology used is consistent with other retailers we believe that our
estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns when we
collect payment from customers before ownership of the merchandise has passed or
the service has been performed the amount received is recorded as a deferred
revenue liability

inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or
market with approximately 94 valued under the retail method and the remainder
under the cost method


                                       23
page

under the retail method inventory is stated at cost which is determined by
applying a costtoretail ratio to the ending retail value of inventory as our
inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our
inventory methodology approximates the lower of cost or market retailers with
many different types of merchandise at low unit cost with a large number of
transactions frequently use this method in addition we reduce our ending
inventory value for estimated losses related to shrink this estimate is
determined based upon analysis of historical shrink losses and recent shrink
trends

self insurance we are selfinsured for certain losses related to general
liability product liability and workers compensation we maintain stop loss
coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure our liability
represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance
sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based
upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates and is reviewed by
management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the
liability is appropriate while we believe these estimates are reasonable based
on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity
or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums differ from our estimates
our financial results could be impacted in an attempt to mitigate our risks of
workers compensation and general liability claims we have significantly
enhanced our store safety procedures with spi and other safety awareness
programs

use of estimates we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to
the reporting of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in preparing our
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles actual results could differ from these estimates

recent accounting pronouncements

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement
of financial accounting standards sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets under sfas 142 which we will adopt on february 4 2002 goodwill will
no longer be amortized and will instead be evaluated for impairment at least
annually without this change amortization expense for goodwill in fiscal 2002
would have been approximately 11 million we have reviewed our goodwill and
completed our impairment analysis and accordingly have determined that the
adoption of sfas 142 will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets which amends accounting principles board opinion
no 30 apb 30 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects
of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions sfas 144 retains the
fundamental provisions of sfas 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived
assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of for recognizing and
measuring impairment losses on longlived assets held for use and longlived
assets to be disposed of by sale while resolving significant implementation
issues sfas 144 retains the basic provisions of apb 30 on the presentation of
discontinued operations in the income statement but expands the scope to
include all distinguishable components of an entity that will be eliminated from
ongoing operations in a disposal transaction we plan to adopt sfas 144 on
february 4 2002 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements

         companys overall level of sales and sales of particular lines of
         products such as building materials lumber and lawn and garden
         supplies

        instability of costs and availability of sourcing channels which may
         affect the prices that the company pays for certain commodity products
         such as lumber and plywood as well as the companys ability to improve
         its mix of merchandise our cost of sales is affected by our ability to
         maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with our suppliers

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

our exposure to market risks results primarily from fluctuations in interest
rates although we have international operating entities our exposure to
foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition
and results our objective for holding derivative instruments is to decrease the
volatility of earnings and cash flow associated with fluctuations in these
rates

we have financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
these instruments include fixed rate debt and other contractual arrangements we
issued 500 million of 5 38 senior notes in fiscal 2001 maturing on april 1
2006 and 500 million of 6 12 senior notes in fiscal 1999 maturing on
september 15 2004 as of february 3 2002 the market values of the publicly
traded 5 38 and 612 senior notes were approximately 511 million and
531 million respectively we have two interest rate swap agreements both
designed to hedge the market risk associated with interest rate volatility
we have one agreement in the notional amount of 300 million that swaps fixed
rate interest on 300 million of our 500 million 5 38 senior notes for a
variable interest rate equal to libor plus 30 basis points and expires on
april 1 2006 we have another agreement expiring january 31 2003 in the
notional amount of 690 million that swaps a variable interest rate for a
fixed rate of 6 34 designed to mitigate the interest rate risk related to
the portfolio of our proprietary credit card which is serviced by a third
party

we buy our store merchandise from vendors located throughout the world no
single vendor accounts for more than six percent of our total purchases and we
are not dependent on any single vendor most of our merchandise is purchased
directly from manufacturers which eliminates middleman costs we believe
that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all
of the products we sell in home depot stores

we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source highquality
products directly from overseas manufacturers which gives our customers a
broader selection of products and better values while enhancing our gross
margin our product development managers travel internationally to identify
opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores this enables us to
improve product quality to import products not currently available to our
customers and to offer at a lower price products that would otherwise be
purchased from third party importers we currently source products from more
than 260 manufacturers in approximately 35 countries

to complement the established national brand name products we offer we have
formed strategic alliances with vendor partners to market products under brand
names that are only offered through the home depot at the end of fiscal year
2000 we offered products under more than 30 proprietary and other exclusive
brands including thomasvilletm kitchen and bathroom cabinets ridgidr
power tools behr premium plusr paint mills prider cabinets ge
smartwatertm water heaters and vigoror fertilizer in the future we may
consider additional strategic alignments with other vendors to offer products
under proprietary brand names additionally we will continue to assess
opportunities to expand the range of products available under existing
proprietary brands

installed sales services home depot stores offer a variety of installed sales
programs through its athome services business this service targets the biy
customer who will select and purchase materials for a project and prefers the
company to provide professional installation we implement our installed sales
programs through approximately 6800 independent qualified contractors in the
us and canada these programs include the installation of carpeting hard
flooring cabinets solid surface countertops exterior doors garage doors
roofing siding and windows during fiscal 2000 we also began testing a
residential hvac program in tennessee and georgia and plan to expand the
offering during fiscal 2001

instore initiatives we continually assess our business to find opportunities
to increase customer loyalty thereby increasing sales accordingly we
implemented or expanded a number of instore initiatives in home depot stores
during fiscal 2000 including

                 professional business customer initiative we are committed
                  to being the supplier of choice to a variety of professional
                  customers including certain repair remodelers carpenters
                  plumbers painters electricians building maintenance
                  professionals and designers during fiscal 2000 we continued
                  to expand an initiative that adds servicerelated programs to
                  our stores that are designed to increase sales to
                  professional customers stores participating in the program
                  add associates at a sales desk dedicated to providing more
                  personalized service to professional customers including
                  managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pickup
                  or sameday delivery additionally during the hours when
                  professionals typically shop these stores assign sales
                  associates in certain departments to assist these customers
                  to better serve our professional customers we also increase
                  quantities of existing products typically purchased by


                                       3

                  professionals in bulk quantities and offer certain items in
                  each department packaged in bulk to offer additional savings
                  while aimed at the professional customer this program also
                  enables us to better serve our diy customer with improved
                  customer service including delivery and willcall services
                  expanded credit programs and additional merchandise through
                  this initiative we have identified best practices in serving
                  our professional customers that are being implemented in many
                  of our stores without material additional costs by the end
                  of fiscal 2000 we had expanded the professional customer
                  initiative into 29 markets with approximately 165 stores we
                  anticipate that during fiscal year 2001 we will expand this
                  initiative to approximately 335 additional stores

                 spi initiative we began testing the service performance
                  improvement or spi initiative during fiscal 2000 in
                  approximately 51 stores in three markets the program focuses
                  on making it easier to shop in our stores while emphasizing
                  safety and improving customer service stores that have
                  implemented the initiative assign some associates specific
                  tasks while others focus on assisting customers
                  additionally these stores schedule associates to receive
                  shipments and stock merchandise when our stores are closed or
                  during hours when they have fewer customers we believe this
                  separation of assignments will allow us to provide better
                  customer service while improving labor productivity managing
                  inventory more efficiently and increasing sales we currently
                  anticipate rolling this program out to most of our stores
                  during fiscal 2001

                 appliance sales during fiscal 2000 we completed the
                  rollout of our appliance sales program to most of our stores
                  in the us through this program we sell appliances
                  manufactured by general electricr maytagr and other
                  manufacturers we display and stock the more popular
                  appliances in our stores and offer the ability to special
                  order over 2000 additional products through computer kiosks
                  located in the store through the computer kiosks we can
                  check inventory and arrange for delivery to the customer
                  directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the
                  order is placed during fiscal 2001 we plan to expand the
                  appliances we sell and to continue to test new formats for
                  selling appliances

                 tool rental as part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range
                  of the needs of our professional customers and our diy
                  customers we offer a tool rental service in certain stores
                  under this program we rent approximately 200
                  commercialquality tools in ten categories including saws
                  floor sanders generators gas powered lawn equipment and
                  plumbing tools customers can lease the tools on an hourly
                  daily weekly or monthly basis our associates who work in
                  the tool rental area receive special training concerning the
                  use and maintenance of the tools as of january 28 2001 we
                  offered tool rental service in approximately 342 stores
                  compared to 150 stores at the end of fiscal 1999 during
                  fiscal 2001 we anticipate expanding tool rental services
                  into additional stores and we believe that ultimately tool
                  rental centers will be in approximately 60 of our stores we
                  believe that offering this service increases the sales of
                  related merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment
                  similar to that available for rental

                  tollfree number and special order blinds and wallpaper
                  through a separate tollfree number that is available to
                  approximately 95 stores in three markets stores currently
                  participating in the program have experienced increased water
                  heater sales and reductions in customer transaction times for
                  placing orders for blinds and wallpaper

                 customer education programs we offer several programs to
                  enhance the skills and confidence of our diy customers our
                  associates and vendors teach howto clinics that focus on
                  diy projects such as installing garbage disposals laying
                  patio pavers or building a deck in addition to the clinics
                  we offer home depot universitysm which presents fourweek
                  modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets
                  of a home improvement topic for example a room enhancement
                  module may provide instruction on paint wallpaper and window
                  treatments through the home depots kids workshopsm
                  program children are instructed in tool safety and complete a
                  small project such as building a birdhouse or tool box we
                  believe that these types of educational programs increase our
                  sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects
                  differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our
                  position as experts in home improvement

store growth

united states at the end of fiscal 2000 we were operating 1029 home depot
stores in the united states including puerto rico during fiscal 2000 in the
us we opened 173 new home depot stores and relocated eight existing home
depot stores although these new store openings occurred primarily in existing
markets we continued our geographic expansion by opening stores in a number of
new markets we currently anticipate opening approximately 200 new stores and
relocating nine existing stores during fiscal 2001

to increase customer service levels gain incremental sales and enhance
longterm market penetration we often open new stores near the edge of the
market areas served by existing stores while these openings may initially have
a negative impact on comparable storeforstore sales we believe this
cannibalization strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market
share by reducing delays in shopping increasing utilization by existing
customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations during
fiscal 2000 approximately 30 of our stores were cannibalized by new store
openings

including our first stores in quebec and nova scotia during fiscal 2001 we

store support services

information systems each home depot expo design center and villagers
hardware store is equipped with a computerized point of sale system electronic
bar code scanning system and a unix server store information is communicated
to the store support centers computers via a landbased asynchronous transfer
mode atm network in the us and a frame relay network internationally
these computers provide corporate financial merchandising and other back
office function support we believe our systems provide efficient customer
checkout and returns storebased inventory management rapid order
replenishment labor planning support and item movement information fast
registers credit authorizations and check approvals expedite transactions in
our stores at a pace that we believe sets the standard for our industry for
example to better serve the increasing number of customers applying for credit
while in our stores the charge card approval process time has been reduced to
less than 30 seconds

we have implemented a mobile ordering system in our home depot stores using
portable carts with


                                       8
page   11


computers to assist our associates in placing accurate orders for inventory
through the system an associate on the sales floor can see the supply the
store has for a given item review the suggested reorder quantities based on
the stores historical experience and place an order with the vendor we
believe the system increases the efficiency and productivity of our associates
because it requires less time and fewer people to assess and order inventory
we have also implemented a mobile signing system to help ensure that our
signing is consistent with our pointofsale price data additionally we are
in the process of rolling out additional systems tools to assist with labor
scheduling to help ensure the best possible customer service levels

we are continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems to support
growth reduce and control costs and enable our associates to make better
decisions we continue to realize greater efficiency as a result of our
electronic data interchange edi program currently most of our high volume
vendors are participating in the edi program which represents more than 70 of
our total transactional volume edi is a paperless system which processes
orders from buying offices to vendors alerts the stores when the merchandise
is to arrive and transmits invoice data from the vendors and freight carriers
to the store support center

associate development as of january 28 2001 we employed approximately
227000 associates of whom approximately 12800 were salaried with the
remainder compensated on an hourly basis approximately 74 of our associates
are employed on a fulltime basis to attract and retain qualified personnel
we seek to maintain salary and wage levels equal to or above those of our
competitors in each market area store managers have access to information
regarding competitive salary rates in their respective markets

we develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of
our associates these programs are designed to increase associates knowledge
of merchandising departments and products including mandatory product
knowledge training classes and to educate develop and test the skills of
those associates who are interested in being promoted because our policy is to
promote or relocate current associates to serve as managers and assistant
managers for new stores training and assessment of our associates is essential
to our growth our district managers and store managers typically meet with our
human resources associates to discuss the development of assistant managers and
certain department heads and consider possible candidates for promotion

we have implemented programs in our stores to ensure that we hire and promote
the best qualified associates in a nondiscriminatory way these programs
integrate validated computerized tests for all applicants as well as
specialized tests for certain positions if an applicant passes the computer
test he or she may be selected for a structured interview in which questions
to be asked are selected by the computer based on the answers given on the
original computer test we also maintain a list of qualified associates who are
interested in a new assignment and of qualified outside applicants that can be
reviewed when positions become available

we have never experienced a strike or any work stoppage and we believe that
our employee relations are good there are no collective bargaining agreements
covering any of our associates

marketing we are one of the nations largest retail advertisers and we
utilize all forms of mass media and selected forms of highly targeted media we
also incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan such as nascarr
the olympic games cbs college football and home and garden shows we extend
our reach and educate our customers through proprietary publications


                                       9
page   12


such as the home improvement 123tm series and the style ideas magazine

we execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis because
the vast majority of our stores are located throughout the united states and
canada we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers by using
national advertising at the same time we tailor the majority of our
advertising locally to respond to market differences both in terms of products
and the competitive environment

credit services home depot offers credit purchase programs to both
professional and diy and biy customers in fiscal 2000 26 million new
home depot credit accounts were opened bringing the total number of home depot
account holders to almost 8 million proprietary credit card sales accounted
for approximately 19 of all home depot sales in fiscal 2000 during fiscal
2000 we rolledout a program to all us stores that gives our customers the
opportunity to apply for unsecured home improvement loans to purchase products
and services in our stores we believe that this loan program not only
increases large sales such as kitchen and bath remodels but also generates
incremental sales from our customers

intellectual property through our wholly owned subsidiary homer tlc inc we
have registered or applied for registration of a variety of trade names
service marks trademarks and copyrights for use in our business including the
home depotr the homer r character expo design centerr stores hampton
bayr fans lighting and accessories and premiumcuttm lumber we regard our
intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important
factor in the marketing of the company and our stores and direct marketing
efforts we are not aware of any facts that could be expected to negatively
impact our intellectual property

quality assurance program for our globally sourced products that we directly
import we have implemented a quality assurance program through this program
we have established criteria for both vendorfactory and product performance
which measure factors including product quality timely shipments and fill
rate the performance record is monitored relative to our requirements and is
also made available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement
this quality assurance program which is applied to products directly imported
by home depot has four components

                 we authorize laboratories to test products prior to purchase
                  to ensure compliance with requirements

                 we develop and document product requirements based on test
                  results applicable national and international standards and
                  features determined by our merchants

                 we assess the capability of factories to manufacture quality
                  products that meet the expectations we have developed as
                  well as to assess their compliance with home depot policies
                  on child labor and

                 we routinely assess product quality and factory performance
                  by conducting inspections at the factory on shipments to
                  assure continued compliance with our product requirements
                  and we reserve the right to perform random audits on child
                  labor policies


                                      10

logistics we use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase
our efficiencies a large percentage of our merchandise is shipped directly
from our vendors to the stores we operate a number of facilities to distribute
the remaining merchandise to our stores for example certain import products
require the use of distribution centers accordingly we have seven import
distribution centers located in the united states canada argentina and
chile additionally at the end of fiscal 2000 we had 27 lumber distribution
facilities in the united states and canada to support the lumber demands of our
stores we also operated one crossdocking transit facility and we currently
plan to add several additional facilities during fiscal 2001 at these
facilities we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately load it
onto trucks for delivery to our stores we continually assess opportunities to
improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs of our stores and
to lower costs

safety we are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers
and associates the safety department consists of a team of directors and
managers in the field focused primarily on education and training as well as
an atlantabased team of dedicated safety resources who evaluate and implement
policies and processes companywide the goal of the safety department is to
implement a safety program designed to engineer safety into the fabric of our
company establishing a safety first approach to all facets of our business
our safety department is responsible for managing the companys safety program
which is implemented in conjunction with storelevel associates store and
division management and the human resources and merchandising departments the
primary focuses of our safety program are 1 to establish safety standards and
processes for all aspects of store operations and merchandising 2 to
effectively train appropriate associates on all applicable standards and 3
to monitor compliance with established safety standards

competition our business is highly competitive based in part on price store
location customer service and depth of merchandise in each of the markets we
serve there are a number of other home improvement stores electrical
plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards with respect to
some products we also compete with discount stores local regional and
national hardware stores mail order firms warehouse clubs independent
building supply stores and to a lesser extent other retailers in addition to
these entities our expo design center stores also compete with specialty
design stores or showrooms some of which are only open to interior design
professionals

due to the variety of competition we face we are unable to precisely measure
our market share in existing market areas we believe that we are an effective
and significant competitor in our markets based on us census data estimates
internal estimates and data provided by the home improvement research
institute we believe that our market share in the us and canada currently
defined as including the doityourselfbuyityourself tradesmen
buildersgeneral contractors heavy industrial repair and remodeling and
property maintenance markets is approximately 94

fiscal year ended january 28 2001 compared to january 30 2000

net sales for fiscal 2000 increased 190 to 457 billion from 384 billion

storeforstore sales increase and 204 new store openings

gross profit as a percent of sales was 299 for fiscal 2000 compared to 297
for fiscal 1999 the rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost
of merchandise resulting from product line reviews benefits from global
sourcing programs and an increase in the number of tool rental centers from 150
at the end of fiscal 1999 to 342 at the end of fiscal 2000

margin product categories and assortments in addition inventory and refund

senior notes the senior notes are due on september 15 2004 and pay
interest semiannually the senior notes may be redeemed by the company at any
time in whole or in part at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest
up to the redemption date the net proceeds from the offering were used to
finance a portion of the companys capital expenditure program including store
expansions and renovations for working capital needs and for general corporate
purposes

the company has a commercial paper program that allows borrowings up to a
maximum of 1 billion as of january 28 2001 there were 754 million of
borrowings outstanding under the program in connection with the program the
company has a backup credit facility with a consortium of banks for up to 800
million the credit facility which expires in september 2004 contains various
restrictive covenants none of which is expected to impact the companys
liquidity or capital resources

as of january 28 2001 the company had 167 million in cash and cash
equivalents management believes that its current cash position internally
generated funds funds available from its 1 billion commercial paper program
and the ability to obtain alternate sources of financing should enable the
company to complete its capital expenditure programs including store openings
and renovations through the next several fiscal years

impact of inflation and changing prices

although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of
inflation on its operations it does not believe inflation has had a material
effect on sales or results of operations

recent accounting pronouncements

in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 sfas 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 requires all derivatives to be
carried on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the fair value of
derivatives must be recognized in the companys statements of earnings when
they occur however there is an exception for derivatives that qualify as
hedges as defined by sfas 133 if a derivative qualifies as a hedge a company
can elect to use hedge accounting to eliminate or reduce the income statement
volatility that would arise from reporting changes in a derivatives fair
value the company will adopt sfas 133 in the quarter ending april 29 2001 and
will record its derivatives at fair value based on the companys derivative
positions at january 28 2001 the adoption of sfas 133 will not have a
material impact on the companys financial results

in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements sab 101 summarizes certain of the sec staffs views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements as of january 28 2001 the company was in compliance with sab 101
