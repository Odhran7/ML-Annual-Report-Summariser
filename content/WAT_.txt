 item 1a

risk factors

the company is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19

pandemic 

the adverse effects of the continuing covid19

pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period has negatively affected the company’s business and operations and may continue to negatively impact the company’s business and operations the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain 

the impact of the global covid19

pandemic over the last two years has resulted in a widespread public health crisis the covid19

pandemic has caused significant volatility and continued spread throughout the united states and globally which has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the company’s business the company operates in over 35 countries including those in the regions most impacted by the covid19

pandemic in response governments of most countries including the united states as well as private businesses have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of covid19

such measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the united states and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the company’s operations including company sales supply chain and cash flow 

the covid19

pandemic has and may continue to have a significant impact on our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted temporarily closed or experience worker shortages the current logistic and supply chain issues being experienced throughout the world have made it more difficult for us to manage our operations and as such we cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in the logistics and supply chains will not have a material impact on our future financial results and cashflows we have and may continue to have disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products 

in addition in the event of a sustained downturn in customer demand or other economic conditions due to the covid19

pandemic could result in material charges related to bad debt or inventory writeoffs restructuring charges or impairments of longlived assets including both tangible and intangible assets furthermore such a sustained downturn in financial markets and asset values could adversely affect the company’s cost of capital liquidity and access to capital markets 

the covid19

pandemic has caused the company to take measures to modify its business practices we have invested in maintaining safe work environments for our employees by among other things adding work from home flexibility adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay at home increasing cleaning protocols across all work locations initiating regular communications regarding the impacts of the covid19

pandemic establishing new physical distancing and safety procedures for employees modifying workplaces as appropriate and implementing protocols to address actual and suspected covid19

cases and potential exposure further the company has modified policies regarding employee travel and physical participation in meetings events and conferences the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the company determines are in the best interests of among others its employees customers distributors and suppliers the company’s change in business practices may result in the company experiencing lower workforce efficiency and productivity in addition as company employees work from home 

 

and access the company’s systems remotely the company may be subject to heightened security risks including the risks of cyberattacks although we are in reopening

processes for our corporate and other facilities such processes may face future closure requirements there is no certainty that the company measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19

and the company’s ability to perform critical functions could be adversely impacted furthermore the company’s business could be adversely affected if any of the company’s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time including as a result of illness 

the degree to which covid19

ultimately affects the company’s business financial results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact the availability distribution acceptance and efficacy of a vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 72 and 71 of the company’s net sales in 2021 and 2020 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the uk as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk’s exit from the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers the impact of global health pandemics and epidemics such as covid19

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely 

 

diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

risks related to our business 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to academic governmental and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end however there can be no assurance that the company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects additionally there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 60 and 59 of the company’s net sales in 2021 and 2020 respectively were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons including increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over 

 

the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized furthermore these new products will be sold into both the nonclinical

and clinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences 

despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company additionally there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

the company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products 

the company sells some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax

income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 up to 34 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

the company entered into a new development and expansion incentive in singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 on certain types of income for the period april 1 2021 through march 31 2026 prior to april 1 2021 the company had a tax exemption in singapore on certain types of income based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company met as of december 31 2020 and maintained through march 2021 the company had determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in singapore and accordingly did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this tax exemption if any of the milestone targets were not met the company would not have been entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

risks related to human capital management 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees 

our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify attract retain and motivate them implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations the market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive and competitors for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire and to varying degrees have 

 

been successful in hiring our employees a number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer further existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the united states making the pool of available talent even smaller if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees our business may be harmed 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees with the exception of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason other key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

disruption cyberattack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased

systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems for example in december 2021 a vulnerability named “log4shell” was reported for the widely used java logging library apache log4j 2 we have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our it environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability to date cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact additionally we must maintain and periodically upgrade our information and webbased

systems which has caused and will in the future cause temporary interruptions to our technology infrastructure any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

if the company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure research and development efforts or manufacturing operations the company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable the information protected by the company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access acquisition or modification the company’s brand and reputation could be damaged the services that the company provides to its customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using the company’s products and services all of which could reduce the company’s revenue and earnings increase its expenses and expose the company to legal claims and regulatory actions 

the company is in the business of designing manufacturing selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety and environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications and the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that support instrument systems many of the company’s customers are in highly regulated industries while the company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations products and services and the internal and external data managed by the company there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats the company also has acquired companies products services and technologies over time and may face inherent risk when integrating these acquisitions into the company in addition at times the company faces attempts by third 

 

parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems these risks will increase as the company continues to grow and expand geographically and its systems products and services become increasingly digital and sensor and webbased

the company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to acquisition of or modification to the company’s technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the company such an incident could disrupt the company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services this could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them as well as to lawsuits regulatory investigations claims or legal liability including contractual liability costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners 

risks related to compliance regulatory or legal changes 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport privacy and data protection fcpa and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations and the european union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information such as information related to health could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the company’s products or services any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against the company or levied by governmental entities or others or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the company’s reputation 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational safety and health administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

as a publiclytraded company the company is subject to the rules of the sec and the new york stock exchange in addition the company must comply with the sarbanesoxley regulations which require the company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly while we continue to enhance our controls we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material 

 

weaknesses failure to comply with such regulations or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operations which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in 2020 the company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products however the company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries the company is in the process of evaluating its 2021 supply chain and the company plans to file its 2021 form sd with the sec in may 2022 the results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products 

the company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws including laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary

penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

environmental social and corporate governance “esg” issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning esg matters additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ esg practices continue to grow if our esg practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor customer consumer employee or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship and sustainability support for local communities board of director and employee diversity human capital management employee health and safety practices product quality supply chain management corporate governance and transparency our reputation brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us 

customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change energy and water use plastic waste and other sustainability concerns concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse

and nonrecyclable

plastic products and packaging other 

 

components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing operating or product development costs

general risk factors 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the us uk ireland and germany in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather and geological conditions or events including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the company’s results from operations are dependent on future results which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies the company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition bad debts inventory valuation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions litigation retirement plan obligations stockbased compensation business combinations and asset acquisitions uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets 

the company sponsors various retirement plans both inside and outside the united states any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the company’s cash flows or results of operations in connection with these retirement plans the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets for example changes in longterm interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the company’s retirement plan 

 

obligations and related expense in addition changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are 

 

believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services the company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts 

the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer in substantially all of the company’s arrangements title of the product transfers at shipping point and as a result the company determined control transfers at the point of shipment in more limited cases there are destinationbased shipping terms and thus control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site all incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales in situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers the company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost accordingly such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer in more rare situations the company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied the company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions and collected by the company from a customer 

generally the company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation the company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service which requires judgment the company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours in developing these estimates the company considers past history competition billing rates of current services and other factors 

the company has sales from standalone software which are included in instrument systems revenue these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which the company has determined are distinct performance obligations the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable

basis 

payment terms and conditions vary among the company’s revenue streams although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment prior to providing payment terms to customers an evaluation of their credit risk is performed returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and therefore there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products 

 

service revenue includes i service and software maintenance contracts and ii service calls time and materials instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period the amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the maintenance service period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

the company’s deferred revenue liabilities at december 31 2021 of 274 million on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to transfer of control of the instrument the company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period 

allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable 

the company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for credit losses as of january 1 2020 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to our trade receivable balances the allowance for credit losses policies described below were effective as of january 1 2020 

the company maintains allowances for expected credit losses based on applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance on current receivables along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery the historical loss rate is calculated by comparing the prior year actual sales and accounts receivable balances to estimate the period of collection of trade receivables by aging category this collection information by aging category is then compared to write offs over the same prior year period to estimate the amount of allowance that is attributable to each category of our accounts receivable aging past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forwardlooking information are included in the specific adjustment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond what is estimated in the current expected credit loss model resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant credit losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for expected credit losses the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2021 was 613 million net of allowances for expected credit losses of 13 million 

loss provision on inventory 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin

firstout

basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2021 was recorded at its net realizable value of 356 million which is net of writedowns of 32 million 

 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 242 million 548 million and 438 million respectively as of december 31 2021 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on december 31 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units waters and ta the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future as the estimated fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its income taxes taking into account the amount timing and character of taxable income tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods such changes could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

 

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2021 the company had unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties of 29 million 

the company has a new development and expansion incentive in singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 on certain types of income for the period april 1 2021 through march 31 2026 this new incentive has similar requirements for business spending targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and performance of certain research and manufacturing activities as previous agreements prior to april 1 2021 the company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in singapore based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones which the company met as of december 31 2020 and maintained through march 2021 these milestones include the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center the company determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in singapore and accordingly did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this exemption in the event that any of the milestone targets were not met the company would not be entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in singapore and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2021 the company’s warranty liability was 11 million 

litigation 

as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k

the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

in 2018 the company settled its defined benefit pension plan in the united states as a result of this settlement the company’s defined benefit pension obligations were significantly reduced in 2018 and 2019 the company still maintains a number of smaller defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits throughout the world assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s remaining less significant pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the 

 

discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 625 for its us benefit plans and 258 for its nonus

benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus

benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2021 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2021 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 270 for the us benefit plans and 140 for the nonus

benefits plans 

a onequarter

percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million a onequarter

percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2021 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on 

 

their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess

research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

derivative transactions 

the company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and as a result the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its nonus

dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency 

the company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to 1 naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and 2 mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments the company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows 

foreign currency exchange contracts 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated operating assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real 

 

interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements 

as of december 31 2021 the company had threeyear interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of 230 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments under hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity deficit until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation the difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

 

the following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements in thousands

the company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2021 and 2020 440 million out of 569 million and 364 million out of 443 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries in addition 298 million out of 569 million and 254 million out of 443 million of cash cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the us dollar at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively as of december 31 2021 the company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles

 item 1a

risk factors

the company is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19

pandemic 

the company’s business has been and may continue to be negatively affected by outbreaks of disease such as epidemics or pandemics including the ongoing covid19

pandemic 

outbreaks of disease such as epidemics or pandemics have and could continue to negatively affect the company’s business both the company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global covid19

pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the us and international markets since being declared a pandemic in march 2020 by the world health covid19

has continued to spread throughout the us and globally the covid19

pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in us and international markets which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn the company operates in over 35 countries including those in the regions most impacted by the covid19

pandemic many countries including the us have implemented measures such as quarantine shelterinplace

curfew and similar isolation measures including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations such measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the us and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the company’s operations including the company’s sales supply chain and cash flow certain jurisdictions have experienced increased numbers of covid19

infections following the reopenings

of their economies and easing of restrictions which in some cases has required closings of certain business activity and the imposition of other restrictions in response it is unclear whether the increases in the number of infections will continue and amplify or whether any socalled

“second waves” of covid19

infections will be experienced in the united states or elsewhere and if so what the impact of that would be on human health and safety the economy and our business although the fda has approved certain therapies and two vaccines for emergency use and distribution the initial rollout of vaccine distribution has encountered significant delays and there remains uncertainties about the amount of vaccine available for distribution the logistics of implementing a national vaccine program and the overall efficacy of the vaccines once widely administered especially as new strains of covid19

have been discovered and the level of resistance these new strains have to the existing vaccines remains unknown additionally the widespread pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant disruption of global financial markets which may reduce the company’s ability to access capital 

the covid19

pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted temporarily closed or experience worker shortages we may also see disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products 

 

as a result of the ongoing covid19

pandemic the company has transitioned the majority of its workforce to a temporary remote working model which may result in the company experiencing lower workforce efficiency and productivity which in turn may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition as company employees work from home and access the company’s system remotely the company may be subject to heightened security risks including the risks of cyberattacks additionally if any of the company’s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time including as the result of illness the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the covid19

pandemic or the related response or the extent to which the disruption may continue to impact the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows ultimately the covid19

pandemic could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 of the company’s net sales in both 2020 and 2019 were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the uk as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk’s exit from the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers the impact of public health epidemics such as the coronavirus currently impacting china and elsewhere difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely 

 

diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

risks related to our business 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to academic governmental and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end however there can be no assurance that the company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects additionally there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 59 and 57 of the company’s net sales in 2020 and 2019 respectively were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons including increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired 

 

technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized furthermore these new products will be sold into both the nonclinical

and clinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences 

despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company additionally there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract 

 

manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products 

the company sells some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax

income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 up to 34 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

the company has a tax exemption in singapore on certain types of income through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company met as of december 31 2020 and expects to maintain through march 2021 currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in singapore and accordingly has not recognized any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this tax exemption in the event that any of the milestone targets were not met the company would not be entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period in addition the company has a new development and expansion incentive in singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 on certain types of income for the period april 1 2021 through march 31 2026 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws including laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary

penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

general risk factors 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible 

 

emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the us uk ireland and germany in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather and geological conditions or events including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the company’s results from operations are dependent on future results which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies the company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition bad debts inventory valuation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions litigation retirement plan obligations stockbased compensation business combinations and asset acquisitions uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets 

the company sponsors various retirement plans both inside and outside the us any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the company’s cash flows or results of operations in connection with these retirement plans the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets for example changes in longterm interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense in addition changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow 

the company had 14 billion in debt and 443 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 14 billion from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt was in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs as such the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through 1 cash from operations 2 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility 3 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements which may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition

both the company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19”

that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the us and international markets the company is actively managing its business to respond to the covid19

impact however the company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the covid19

pandemic or the related response or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the company’s business consolidated financial position consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future 

in 2020 the covid19

pandemic did not materially impact the company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes the distribution centers where its inventory is managed or the operations of its logistics and other service providers the company also did not see material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of its products 

at every stage of the pandemic the company has taken decisive and appropriate actions including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of those in manufacturing distribution and certain laboratory environments as well as restrictions on nonessential

travel and visitors into its facilities the company has engaged a medical advisor to guide its policy deployment and the company continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions the company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multiphase process that was developed during the year to ensure for the safe return of employees to its physical workplaces as social distancing governmental requirements and other protocols allow 

the vast majority of the markets the company serves most notably the pharmaceutical biomedical research foodenvironmental and clinical markets have continued to operate at various levels and the company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation over the last several years the company has executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and 

 

collaboration tools to its employees the company’s strategic technology investments have enabled it to swiftly meet remote working needs as the covid19

situation has escalated and evolved from a customerfacing perspective the company is leveraging digital demand generation activities including virtual demos across all regions in which it operates remote instrument installations virtual sales seminars online product training and a rapid acceleration in oneonone

communications over emails phone and video conferencing 

while the company initially anticipated that the covid19

pandemic would have the biggest impact on the company’s financial results in the second quarter of 2020 and future quarters would improve as countries lifted their business restrictions the new outbreaks of covid19

in the us and elsewhere throughout the world have demonstrated that the covid19

pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks remaining across the global economy the company took a proactive approach to managing through this unpredictability and implemented a series of cost reduction actions that include salary reductions furloughs and reductions in nonessential

spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility these cost reductions were completed by the end of 2020 however the company’s plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery and any further lockdowns 

the company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

 percentage not meaningful 

the company’s net sales decreased approximately 2 in 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased 1 in 2019 as compared to 2018 the decline in sales in 2020 can be attributed to the lower customer demand due to interruption in business activities caused by the uncertainties from the covid19 pandemic

across the world the negative impact of covid19

on our business was more pronounced in the first half of 2020 as the company’s sales declined 12 as compared to the prior year in the second half of 2020 our customers began to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations and it resulted in the company’s second half sales growing 7 as compared to the prior year 

 

foreign currency translation increased sales by less than 1 and decreased sales by 2 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the company’s acquisitions of andrew alliance as defined below and iss as defined below did not have material impacts on sales growth in 2020 unless otherwise noted sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year 

instrument system sales decreased 8 and 4 in 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 the decrease in instrument system sales was attributable to the weaker demand for our products by our customers due to interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic as

customer demand started to return to normal levels instrument system sales increased 3 in the second half of 2020 as compared to the prior year period after having declined 22 in the first half of 2020 compared to the prior year period in 2019 the decrease in instrument system sales was primarily driven by weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions and governmental policy changes foreign currency translation increased instrument system sales by 1 in 2020 and decreased sales by 1 in 2019 recurring revenues combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services increased 4 and 3 in 2020 and 2019 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales in 2020 recurring revenues were also impacted by the interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic

as our customers began to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations recurring revenues increased 10 in the second half of 2020 as compared to the prior year period after having declined 3 in the first half of 2020 compared to the prior year period recurring revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation in 2020 which increased sales by 1 however foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2 in 2019 

geographically the sales declines in 2020 were broadbased across the world except for europe and were due to the weaker demand and disruption of business activities caused by the covid19 lockdowns

sales in asia decreased 4 in 2020 and increased 2 in 2019 with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales in 2020 and negatively impacting sales by 1 in 2019 in 2020 the sales decline in asia was primarily driven by the 8 decrease in sales in china due to lower demand caused by the covid19

pandemic excluding sales in china the company’s 2020 sales were flat with foreign currency translation positively impacting sales by 1 the decline in the company’s sales in 2019 was a result of increased sales in the us canada japan and the rest of asia being offset by a decrease in sales in other geographies on weaker demand for our products due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions primarily from brexit as well as latin america and governmental policy changes in china 

sales in europe increased 5 in 2020 and decreased 4 in 2019 with foreign currency translation positively impacting sales by 3 in 2020 and negatively impacting sales by 4 in 2019 sales in the americas decreased 4 and 1 in 2020 and 2019 respectively with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales in 2020 and negatively impacting sales by 1 in 2019 

sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 2 and were flat in 2020 and 2019 respectively with foreign currency translation positively impacting sales by 1 in 2020 and negatively impacting sales by 2 in 2019 combined sales to industrial customers which include material characterization food environmental and fine chemical markets declined 2 in both 2020 and 2019 with foreign currency translation positively impacting sales by 1 in 2020 the lower volume of sales to both pharmaceutical and industrial customers in 2020 was primarily due to the disruption in business activities caused by covid19

similarly ta sales declined 8 and 4 in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

combined sales to academic and governmental customers decreased 16 in 2020 and increased 2 in 2019 with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales in 2020 and decreasing sales by 1 in 2019 the decline in sales to academic and governmental customers in 2020 was due to the lower demand for our products and services as the academic and governmental institutions adjusted their spending during the year to mitigate the effects of the covid19 pandemic

the most significant decline in academic and governmental sales in 2020 occurred in china where sales declined 31 due to governmentmandated spending reductions 

 

sales to our academic and governmental customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and as such sales can vary significantly from period to period 

operating income was 645 million in 2020 a decrease of 9 as compared to 2019 this decrease can be attributed to the decline in sales volumes caused by the covid19 pandemic

unfavorable manufacturing absorption and unfavorable foreign currency translation the operating income decline was somewhat mitigated by a series of cost reduction actions that included salary reductions furloughs and reductions in nonessential spending

that increased operating income by approximately 103 million in 2020 versus our operating plan operating income in 2020 also included 27 million of severancerelated costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination and exit costs 

operating income decreased 4 in 2019 as compared to 2018 this decrease can be attributed to lower sales volume the effect of foreign currency translation and 10 million of severancerelated costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in early 2019 offset by lower variable incentive compensation costs 

the company’s effective tax rates were 146 127 and 130 for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively net income per diluted share was 836 869 and 765 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in 2018 the company settled a pension plan obligation and incurred a 46 million expense which reduced the net income per diluted share by 039 

the company generated 791 million 643 million and 604 million of net cash flows from operations in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in operating cash flow in 2020 was primarily a result of the 103 million reduction in expense from the cost actions implemented and working capital improvements during the year the increase in operating cash flow in 2019 was primarily a result of payments made in 2018 that did not recur including 103 million of income tax payments made in the us relating to the company’s estimated 2017 transition tax liability and 2018 estimated tax payments a 15 million litigation settlement payment and 11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans included in the 2020 and 2019 net cash flow from operations is 38 million and 29 million respectively of income tax payments made in the us in relation to the 2017 transition tax liability over the next two years the company is required to make annual us federal tax payments of approximately 38 million to tax authorities in connection with the company’s estimated remaining transition tax liabilities of 365 million under the 2017 tax act the final 60 of the total liability is required to be paid over a threeyear period beginning in 2023 

cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization of 172 million 164 million and 96 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in january of 2020 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of andrew alliance sa and its two operating subsidiaries andrew alliance usa inc and andrew alliance france sasu collectively “andrew alliance” for 80 million net of cash acquired the company had an equity investment in andrew alliance that was valued at 4 million and included as part of the total consideration in december 2020 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of integrated software solutions pty limited and its two operating subsidiaries integrated software solutions limited and integrated software solutions usa llc collectively “iss” for 4 million net of cash acquired neither of these acquisitions had a material effect on the company’s sales and expenses in 2020 

the cash flows from investing activities in 2020 also included 70 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the us the company has incurred 151 million on this facility through the end of 2020 and anticipates spending a total of 215 million to build and equip this new stateoftheart

the company maintains allowances for expected credit losses based on applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance on current receivables along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery the historical loss rate is calculated by comparing the prior year actual sales and accounts receivable balances to estimate the period of collection of trade receivables by aging category this collection information by aging category is then compared to write offs over the same prior year period to estimate the amount of allowance that is attributable to each category of our accounts receivable aging past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forwardlooking information are included in the specific adjustment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond what is estimated in the current expected credit loss model resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant credit losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may 

 

result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2020 was 573 million net of allowances for expected credit losses of 14 million

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2020 the company had unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties of 29 million 

the company has a tax exemption in singapore on certain types of income through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company met as of december 31 2020 and expects to maintain through march 2021 these milestones include the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in singapore and accordingly has not recognized any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this exemption in the event that any of the milestone targets were not met the company would not be entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period

litigation 

as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k

the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

in 2018 the company settled its defined benefit pension plan in the us as a result of this settlement the company’s defined benefit pension obligations were significantly reduced in 2018 and 2019 the company still maintains a number of smaller defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits throughout the world assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s remaining less significant pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 625 for its us benefit plans and 299 for its nonus

benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus

benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2020 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2020 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 225 for the us benefit plans and 112 for the nonus

benefits plans 

a onequarter

percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million a onequarter

percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess

research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

derivative transactions 

the company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and as a result the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its nonus

dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency 

 

the company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to 1 naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and 2 mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments the company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows 

foreign currency exchange contracts 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated operating assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real 

interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements 

as of december 31 2020 the company has entered into threeyear interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments under hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency 

translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity deficit until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation the difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

the following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts in thousands

the company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper as of december 31 2020 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits and corporate debt securities as of december 31 2020 the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio 

the company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2020 and 2019 364 million out of 443 million and 249 million out of 337 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries in addition 254 million out of 443 million and 176 million out of 337 million of cash cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the us dollar at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as of december 31 2020 the company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend

exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2020 would decrease by approximately 25 million of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity deficit

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse

markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to understand diseases identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products waters also has in vitro diagnostic ivd labelled products that are used as generalpurpose instruments for clinical diagnostic applications such as newborn screening and therapeutic drug management in countries where these products are registered hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc tm

 to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by hplc in addition in using the acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages the acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2018 the company introduced the acquity arc tm

 item 1a risk factors

the company is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 and 72 of the company’s net sales in 2019 and 2018 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the uk as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk’s exit from the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers the impact of public health epidemics such as the coronavirus currently impacting china and elsewhere difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to academic governmental and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end however there can be no assurance that the company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects additionally there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 57 and 56 of the company’s net sales in 2019 and 2018 respectively were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms 

thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons including increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized furthermore these new products will be sold into both the nonclinical

and clinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future

the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences 

despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees with the exception of the chairman and chief executive officer and the senior vice president and chief financial officer have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company additionally there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products 

the company sells some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these 

distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

the company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws including laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary

penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the us uk ireland and germany in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather and geological conditions or events including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax

income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 up to 34 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer 

pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company expects to continue to meet currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized any uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore in the event that it appears that the milestone targets will not be met the company will no longer be entitled to a 0 contractual tax rate benefit on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 at which time all tax benefits previously recorded would be reversed and an income tax charge equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period would be recorded 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow 

the company had 17 billion in debt and 337 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2019 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 12 billion from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt was in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs as such the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through 1 cash from operations 2 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility 3 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased

systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology 

infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

if the company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure research and development efforts or manufacturing operations the company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable the information protected by the company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access acquisition or modification the company’s brand and reputation could be damaged the services that the company provides to its customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using the company’s products and services all of which could reduce the company’s revenue and earnings increase its expenses and expose the company to legal claims and regulatory actions 

the company is in the business of designing manufacturing selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety and environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications and the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that support instrument systems many of the company’s customers are in highly regulated industries while the company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations products and services and the internal and external data managed by the company there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats the company also has acquired companies products services and technologies over time and may face inherent risk when integrating these acquisitions into the company in addition at times the company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems these risks will increase as the company continues to grow and expand geographically and its systems products and services become increasingly digital and sensor and webbased 

the company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to acquisition of or modification to the company’s technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the company such an incident could disrupt the company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services this could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them as well as to lawsuits regulatory investigations claims or legal liability including contractual liability costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport privacy and data protection fcpa and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations and the european union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information such as information related to health could greatly increase the cost of 

compliance and the cost of providing the company’s products or services any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against the company or levied by governmental entities or others or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the company’s reputation

instrument system sales decreased 4 and increased 2 in 2019 and 2018 respectively in 2019 the decrease in instrument system sales was primarily driven by weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions and governmental policy changes in 2018 the increase in instrument system sales was primarily driven by an increase in demand for lc and ta’s instrument systems foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1 in 2019 and increased instrument system sales by 1 in 2018 recurring revenues combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services increased 3 and 8 in 2019 and 2018 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales recurring revenues were impacted by foreign currency which decreased sales by 2 in 2019 and increased sales by 2 in 2018 

geographically the decline in the company’s sales in 2019 was a result of increased sales in the us canada japan and the rest of asia being offset by a decrease in sales in other geographies on weaker demand for our products due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions primarily from brexit as well as latin america and governmental policy changes in china in addition the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2 overall the company’s sales growth in 2018 was primarily driven by the 7 sales growth in asia with china’s sales growing 15 

sales in europe decreased 4 in 2019 and increased 4 in 2018 in 2019 europe sales were impacted by weak demand in western europe caused by the political uncertainties of brexit and the effect of foreign currency translation which reduced sales by 4 in 2019 and increased sales by 3 in 2018 

sales in the americas decreased 1 in 2019 and increased 3 in 2018 the americas sales in 2019 were negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions in latin america and the 2018 americas sales growth can be attributed to the increase in sales after the lower customer demand stemming from the 2017 natural disasters in the us mexico and puerto rico 

sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat in 2019 and grew 5 in 2018 sales to pharmaceutical customers in 2019 were negatively impacted by the lower customer demand in china for our instrument systems as a result of changes in governmental policy and lower sales in latin america despite the sales declines in china and latin america the need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and complex biologic drugs increased in the rest of the world 

combined sales to industrial customers which include material characterization food environmental and fine chemical markets declined 2 in 2019 and grew 2 in 2018 the 2019 industrial customer sales were negatively impacted by a 6 decline in ta instrument system sales and a 1 decline from the effect of foreign currency translation

operating income was 708 million in 2019 a decrease of 4 as compared to 2018 this decrease can be attributed to lower sales volume the effect of foreign currency translation and 10 million of severancerelated costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in early 2019 offset by lower variable incentive compensation costs 

operating income increased 12 in 2018 as compared to 2017 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2018 as well as the effect of approximately 33 million of facility closure litigation and intellectual property payment charges from 2017 that did not recur in 2018 

the company’s effective tax rates were 127 130 and 968 for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively net income per diluted share was 869 765 and 025 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2018 the company settled a pension plan obligation and incurred a 46 million expense which reduced the net income per diluted share by 039 in 2017 the company incurred a 550 million income tax provision related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “2017 tax act” which reduced the net income per diluted share by 682 and excluding the 2017 tax act income tax provision the company’s effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 110 

the company generated 643 million 604 million and 698 million of net cash flows from operations in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in operating cash flow in 2019 was primarily a result of payments made in 2018 that did not recur including 103 million of income tax payments made in the us relating to the company’s estimated 2017 transition tax liability and 2018 estimated tax payments a 15 million litigation settlement payment and 11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans included in the 2019 net cash flow from operations is 29 million of income tax payments made in the us in relation to the 2017 transition tax liability over the next three years the company is required to make annual us federal tax payments of approximately 38 million to tax authorities in connection with the company’s estimated remaining transition tax liabilities of 404 million under the 2017 tax act the final 60 of the total liability is required to be paid over a threeyear period beginning in 2023

cost of sales 

cost of sales for 2019 increased 2 as compared to 2018 due to a change in sales mix the effect of foreign currency translation decreased cost of sales by 1 in 2019 primarily from the favorable foreign currency translation effect the british pound had on the company’s uk manufacturing operations

acquired inprocess

research and development 

during 2017 the company incurred charges of 5 million for acquired inprocess

research and development related to milestone payments associated with a licensing arrangement for certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date these licensing arrangements are significantly related to new biologicallyfocused applications as well as other applications and require the company to make additional future payments of up to 7 million if certain milestones are achieved as well as royalties on future net sales these future payments may be significant and occur over multiple years

interest expense net 

the increase in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and lower interest income on lower cash cash equivalents and investment balances being somewhat offset by the additional interest income from the ustoeuro

interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 127 130 and 968 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

the company’s effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate each year due to differences in the proportionate amounts of pretax

income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates and the items discussed below

the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the us ireland the uk and singapore where the statutory tax rates were 21 125 19 and 17 respectively as of december 31 2019 the company has a received a tax holiday on qualifying activities in singapore through march 2021 based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones which the company expects to continue to meet the effect of applying the 0 contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 by 24 million 28 million and 25 million respectively and increased the company’s net income per diluted share by 035 036 and 031 respectively 

during 2019 the company’s effective tax rate differed from the 21 us statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings an 11 million provision related to the global intangible lowtaxed

income “gilti” tax and a tax benefit of 9 million on stockbased compensation

the 2018 effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings a 14 million provision related to the gilti tax an 8 million provision for a change in foreign currency exchange rates related to the transition tax a 9 million benefit related to stockbased compensation and a 6 million net benefit related to the finalization of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” 

the 2017 effective tax rate of 968 differs from the 35 us statutory tax rate primarily due to the 2017 act and the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of the 2017 act for the year ended december 31 2017 the company accrued a 550 million tax provision which consisted of 490 million related to the federal transition tax 40 million for state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes and 20 million for the revaluation of the 

company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal tax rate of 21 this provision reduced net income per diluted share by 682 in 2017 and the company’s effective tax rate was 110 excluding this 550 million provision during 2017 the company also had a benefit of 20 million related to stockbased compensation the remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pretax

income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates

prior to the enactment of the 2017 act the company had indefinite reinvestment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at the end of 2018 and as a result of the enactment of the 2017 act we reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer considered these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries the company recorded a tax provision of 3 million and 4 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively for future withholding taxes and us state taxes on repatriation of 2019 and 2018 undistributed earnings 

the company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors including but not limited to the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction changes in tax laws tax rates and policies the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation as a result of variability in these factors the company’s effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years or for previously forecasted periods

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 and applied the modifiedretrospective method the company elected the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of january 1 2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective method ultimately the company determined that there was not a significant change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for the company’s products and services the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows and as such did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year the revenue recognition policies described below were effective as of january 1 2018 

the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services the company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts 

the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer in substantially all of the company’s arrangements title of the product transfers at shipping point and as a result the company determined control transfers at the point of shipment in more limited cases there are destinationbased shipping terms and thus control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site all incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales in situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers the company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost accordingly such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer in more rare situations the company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied the company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions and collected by the company from a customer 

generally the company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation the company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is 

recognized separately upon the completion of installation the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service which requires judgment the company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours in developing these estimates the company considers past history competition billing rates of current services and other factors 

the company has sales from standalone software which are included in instrument systems revenue these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which the company has determined are distinct performance obligations the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable

basis 

payment terms and conditions vary among the company’s revenue streams although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment prior to providing payment terms to customers an evaluation of their credit risk is performed returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and therefore there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products 

service revenue includes i service and software maintenance contracts and ii service calls time and materials instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period the amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the maintenance service period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

the company’s deferred revenue liabilities at december 31 2019 was 214 million on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to transfer of control of the instrument the company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2019 was 588 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts of 10 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin

firstout 

basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence 

historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2019 was recorded at its net realizable value of 321 million which is net of writedowns of 26 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

  

 

  

 

  

 

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 240 million 417 million and 356 million respectively as of december 31 2019 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on 

december 31

of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units waters and ta the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future as the fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its income taxes taking into account the amount timing and character of taxable income tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods such changes could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2019 the company had unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties of 28 million 

the company has been granted a 0 contractual tax rate in singapore that requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the company expects to meet to the extent not already achieved by december 31 2020 and maintain through at least march 31 2021 as part of the company’s determination of uncertain tax positions the company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved these milestones were negotiated with the singaporean tax authorities and established based on the company’s historical financial performance the anticipated customer endmarket

demand particularly in certain regions in the world and the company’s anticipated future operating plans these assessments require significant judgments and estimates about the company’s ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center the company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones and the company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved these milestones are very similar in nature to the previous singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the company successfully completed these milestones are not required to be met until december 2020 at the earliest which gives the company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones

currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized an uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore however these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in singapore and the company’s overall financial performance and in the event that the company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met the company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0 contractual tax rate on income earned in singapore from and after the april 1 2016 start date of the contract period at such time the company would record an income tax charge on the affected singapore income earned back to april 1 2016 at the singapore statutory tax rates currently 17 with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet for the year ended 2019 the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income and net income per diluted share by 24 million and 035 respectively 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2019 the company’s warranty liability was 12 million 

litigation 

as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k

the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty

pension and other retirement benefits 

in 2018 the company settled its defined benefit pension plan in the us as a result of this settlement the company’s defined benefit pension obligations were significantly reduced in 2018 and 2019 the company still maintains a number of smaller defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits throughout the world assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s remaining less significant pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 625 for its us benefit plans and 311 for its nonus

benefit plans

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus 

benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2019 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2019 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 342 for the us benefit plans and 138 for the nonus

benefits plans

a onequarter

percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million a onequarter

percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2019 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

  

business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess

research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets

dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency

the company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to 1 naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against 

corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and 2 mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments the company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows 

foreign currency exchange contracts 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated operating assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real 

interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements 

as of december 31 2019 the company has entered into threeyear interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments under hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficit equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation the difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to understand diseases identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc tm  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by hplc in addition in using the acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages the acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2018 the company introduced the acquity tm arc tm bio system a versatile ironfree bioinert quaternary liquid chromatograph specifically engineered to improve bioseparation analytical methods the company also introduced the acquity tm uplc tm plus series in 2018 consisting of the hclass plus hclass plus bio and iclass plus systems which incorporate foundational enhancements into the legacy systems 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated and high sample throughput testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from opticalbased ultraviolet “uv” absorbance refractive index and fluorescence detectors to a suite of msbased detectors optimized for certain analyses 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins as a pressurized sample is introduced to the column inlet and permeates through the packed column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica and polymeric resins packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its 

  

acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2016 the company continued to expand its column chemistry capabilities through the introduction of cortecs tm c 8  cortecs tm phenyl cortecs tm t3 and cortecs tm shield rp18 in 2018 the company introduced the bioresolve tm rp mab polyphenyl columns which improve the consistency and reliability of the overly complex separations of monoclonal antibodies and antibodydrug conjugates 

the company’s precision chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products including certified reference materials “crm”s and proficiency testing “pt” products laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in 2018 the company introduced the vicam tm bpatest tm  which provides a sensitive precise determination of bisphenol a in as little as ten minutes vicam also introduced a userfriendly lateral flow zearalenone strip test the zearalav aqua tm in 2018 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company is a technology and market leader in the development manufacture sale and service of ms instruments and components these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem msms to maximize the speed andor efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and ion mobility designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental clinical and nutritional safety testing the overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system and a liquid compatible interface such as an electrospray ionization source as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo tm tq and xevo tm tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt tm g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2016 the company introduced the xevo tm tqxs mass spectrometry system enabled by the newly designed stepwave tm sx ion guide which features a unique combination of ion optics detection and ionization technologies resulting in levels of sensitivity not previously seen the company also introduced sonar in 2016 which is a new data acquisition technology for use with the xevo g2xs that allows for the quantification and identification of lipids metabolites and proteins in complex samples in a more efficient manner in 2018 the company introduced the dart qda tm system with liveid tm  a directfromsample analytical system that verifies sample authenticity or adulteration specifically for food applications the company also introduced the xevo tm tqgc mass spectrometer in 2018 which allows laboratories to meet and exceed low partperbillion limits of detection when 

  

quantifying pesticide residues and other contaminants in food using gcmsms methods set forth by worldwide regulatory agenciesauthorities in addition the company introduced the renatadx tm screening system a flowinjection tandem mass spectrometry system for rapid highthroughput analysis of extracted dried blood spots and other human biological matrices 

lc and ms are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it has become common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters operating segment to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publiclydisclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc and lcms instrument systems chromatography columns and other consumables and related services

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the company is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 72 and 71 of the company’s net sales in 2018 and 2017 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk voting to exit the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

  

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end however there can be no assurance that the company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects additionally there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 56 of the company’s net sales in both 2018 and 2017 were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

  

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons including increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized furthermore these new products will be sold into both the nonclinical and clinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences 

despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees with the exception of the chairman and chief executive officer and the senior vice president and chief financial officer have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford 

  

ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company additionally there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products 

the company sells some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

the company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws including laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money 

  

laundering and data privacy in particular the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states united kingdom ireland and germany in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather and geological conditions or events including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 up to 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act changed the us tax system to a territorial tax system including base broadening measures on nonus earnings whereby historical unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deemed to have been repatriated to the us in 2017 regardless of when the assets are actually remitted to the us as well as reducing or eliminating certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation earnings deemed to have been distributed to the us in accordance with the aforementioned 2017 tax act deemed distribution rules are subject to a transition tax which is a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the accumulated 

  

foreign earnings that have not been previously taxed to the extent those earnings are deemed to have been invested in cash and cash equivalents they will be taxed at a rate of 155 the remainder of those earnings will be taxed at a rate of 80 as a result the company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings were deemed repatriated in 2017 and the company incurred a 550 million estimated tax provision which primarily consisted of an estimated transition tax as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a provision associated with the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35 to the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period which started in 2018 and will not accrue interest during 2018 the internal revenue service issued proposed regulations with respect to the transition tax and other new areas of the tax reform law that impact the 2018 tax provision the company anticipates additional proposed regulations and the final versions of the currently proposed regulations could clarify or change the interpretation of the new laws as permitted by the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 the company completed its analysis and calculation of the 2017 tax act federal and state transition tax liability during 2018 which remained significantly unchanged 

the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company expects to continue to meet currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized any uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore in the event that it appears that the milestone targets will not be met the company will no longer be entitled to a 0 contractual tax rate benefit on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 at which time all tax benefits previously recorded would be reversed and an income tax charge equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period would be recorded 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow 

the company had 1148 million in debt and 1735 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2018 as of december 31 2018 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 1208 million from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt was in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs 

the company has conducted a posttax reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and is currently planning to use its existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash flow from operations and available debt capacity to repurchase up to 4 billion of the company’s common stock over the next two years as a result the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through 1 cash from operations 2 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility 3 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements which may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or 

  

transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition as of december 31 2018 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

if the company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure research and development efforts or manufacturing operations the company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable the information the company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access acquisition or modification the company’s brand and reputation could be damaged the services that the company provides to its customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using the company’s products and services all of which could reduce the company’s revenue and earnings increase its expenses and expose the company to legal claims and regulatory actions 

the company is in the business of designing manufacturing selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety and environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications and the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that support instrument systems many of the company’s customers are in highly regulated industries while the company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations products and services and the internal and external data managed by the company there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats the company also has acquired companies products services and technologies over time and may face inherit risk when integrating these acquisitions into the company in addition at times the company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems these risks will increase as the company continues to grow and expand geographically and its systems products and services become increasingly digital and sensor and webbased 

the company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to acquisition of or modification to the company’s technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the company such an incident could disrupt the company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services this could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them as well as to lawsuits regulatory investigations claims or legal liability including contractual liability costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners 

  

compliance failures could harm the company’s business

regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations and the european union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information such as information related to health could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the company’s products or services any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against the company or levied by governmental entities or others or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the company’s reputation 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational safety and health administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in 2017 the company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products however the company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries the company is in the process of evaluating its 2018 supply chain and the company plans to file its 2018 form sd with the sec in may 2019 the results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products 

  

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets 

in december 2018 the company settled a frozen us defined benefit pension plan by making lumpsum cash payments and purchasing annuity contracts for participants to permanently extinguish the pension plan’s obligations this plan was the company’s largest defined benefit pension plan the company still sponsors various retirement plans both inside and outside the us any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the company’s cash flows or results of operations in connection with these retirement plans the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets for example changes in longterm interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense in addition changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws 

estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the company’s results from operations are dependent on future results which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies the company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition product returns and allowances bad debts inventory valuation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions litigation retirement plan obligations stockbased compensation equity investments business combinations and asset acquisitions uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

instrument system sales increased 2 and 6 in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2018 the increase in instrument system sales was primarily driven by an increase in demand for lc and ta’s instrument systems during 2018 the demand for our lcms instrument systems was somewhat unfavorably impacted by the timing of new product introductions as many of the company’s new products were not launched until the second half of 2018 or early in 2019 in 2017 the demand for instrument system sales was balanced across our lcms and ta instrument systems recurring revenues combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services increased 8 and 7 in 2018 and 2017 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales 

geographically the company’s sales growth in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily driven by the 7 and 10 sales growth in asia respectively with doubledigit sales growth in china for both years europe’s sales grew 4 and 10 in 2018 and 2017 respectively and benefited from the effect of foreign currency translation which added 3 and 2 to sales growth respectively the company’s 2018 sales were impacted by lower sales growth in india and europe resulting from lower customer demand for our instrument systems sales in the americas grew 3 in 2018 and were flat in 2017 the americas’ sales growth in 2017 was negatively impacted by natural disasters in the us mexico and puerto rico as well as weaker customer sentiment in the first half of 2017 

sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 5 and 7 in 2018 and 2017 respectively these increases were driven by the increasing need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs combined sales to industrial customers which include materials characterization food environmental and fine chemical markets grew 2 and 4 in 2018 and 2017 respectively the growth in both 2018 and 2017 was driven by recent product introductions and rising global regulatory standards in both food and materials markets combined sales to governmental and academic customers increased 8 in both 2018 and 2017 sales to governmental and academic customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and as such sales growth rates can vary significantly from period to period 

operating income was 740 million in 2018 an increase of 12 as compared to 2017 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2018 as well as the effect of approximately 33 million of facility closure litigation and intellectual property payment charges from 2017 that did not recur in 2018 

operating income increased 6 in 2017 as compared to 2016 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2017 which was somewhat offset by the impact of 13 million of severance costs primarily associated with the closure of a facility in germany and costs associated with providing us employees with an early retirement transition incentive an 11 million litigation settlement provision and related costs and a 5 million charge relating to a milestone payment for the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized the change in operating income in 2017 as compared with 2016 was also impacted by 4 million of expense in 2017 related to the acceleration of certain stock awards as compared to 7 million of similar expense in 2016

 the company generated 604 million 698 million and 643 million of net cash flows from operations in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in operating cash flow in 2018 was primarily a result of 103 million of income tax payments made in the us relating to the company’s estimated 2017 transition tax liability and 2018 estimated tax payments a 15 million litigation settlement payment and 11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans over the next four years the company is required to make annual us federal tax payments of approximately 38 million to tax authorities in connection with the company’s estimated transition tax liabilities of 433 million under the 2017 tax act the remaining 60 of the total liability is required to be paid over a threeyear period beginning in 2023 the increase in operating cash flow in 2017 was primarily a result of the increase in sales and operating income 

cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization of 96 million 85 million and 95 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in february 2018 the company’s board of directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the us the company anticipates spending an estimated 215 million to build and equip this new stateoftheart manufacturing facility which will be paid for with existing cash investments and available debt capacity the company has spent 11 million on this facility through the end of 2018

the company has conducted a posttax reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and the company is currently planning to use its existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash flow from operations and its available debt capacity to repurchase up to 4 billion of the company’s common stock over the next two years the company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt balances to approximately 25 times the 

  

company’s net debttoearnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a significant portion of these share repurchases 

in january 2019 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period this new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the april 2018 authorization of 3 billion during 2018 2017 and 2016 the company repurchased 1306 million 323 million and 318 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under authorized share repurchase programs the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits

the remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pretax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates 

the company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors including but not limited to the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction changes in tax laws tax rates and policies the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation in addition upon completion of the company’s review of its capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company has determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings the company estimates that this will increase the company’s effective income tax rate by approximately one percentage point in the future however the company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to earnings as a result of variability in these factors the company’s effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years or for previously forecasted periods

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 and applied the modifiedretrospective method the company elected the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of january 1 2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective method ultimately the company 

  

determined that there was not a significant change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for the company’s products and services the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows and as such did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year the revenue recognition policies described below were effective as of january 1 2018 

the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services the company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts 

the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer in substantially all of the company’s arrangements title of the product transfers at shipping point and as a result the company determined control transfers at the point of shipment in more limited cases there are destinationbased shipping terms and thus control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site all incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales in situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers the company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost accordingly such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer in more rare situations the company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied the company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions and collected by the company from a customer 

generally the company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation the company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service which requires judgment the company determines relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours in developing these estimates the company considers past history competition billing rates of current services and other factors 

the company has sales from standalone software which is included in instrument systems revenue these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which the company has determined are distinct performance obligations the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis 

payment terms and conditions vary among the company’s revenue streams although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment prior to providing payment terms to customers an evaluation of the customer’s credit risk is performed returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and therefore there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products 

  

service revenue includes i service and software maintenance contracts and ii service calls time and materials instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period the amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straightline basis to revenue over the maintenance service period which is the contractual term of the contract as a timebased measure of progress best reflects the company’s performance in satisfying this obligation there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed 

the company’s deferred revenue liabilities at december 31 2018 was 204 million on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to transfer of control of the instrument the company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2018 was 568 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts of 8 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2018 was recorded at its net realizable value of 292 million which is net of writedowns of 23 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of 

  

undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 247 million 343 million and 356 million respectively as of december 31 2018 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units waters and ta the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its income taxes taking into account the amount timing and character of taxable income tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods such changes could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2018 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 27 million 

the company has been granted a 0 contractual tax rate in singapore that requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the company expects to meet to the extent not already achieved by december 31 2020 and maintain through at least march 31 2021 as part of the company’s determination of uncertain tax positions the company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved these milestones were negotiated with the singaporean tax authorities and established based on the company’s historical financial performance the anticipated customer endmarket demand particularly in certain regions in the world and the company’s anticipated future operating plans these assessments require significant judgments and estimates 

  

about the company’s ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center the company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones and the company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved these milestones are very similar in nature to the previous singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the company successfully completed these milestones are not required to be met until december 21 2020 at the earliest which gives the company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones 

currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized an uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore however these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in singapore and the company’s overall financial performance and in the event that the company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met the company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0 contractual tax rate on income earned in singapore from and after the april 1 2016 start date of the contract period at such time the company would record an income tax charge on the affected singapore income earned back to april 1 2016 at the singapore statutory tax rates currently 17 with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet for the year ended 2018 the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income and net income per diluted share by 28 million and 036 respectively 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2018 the company’s warranty liability was 12 million 

litigation 

as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 435 for its us benefit plans and 275 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to 

  

determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2018 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2018 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 440 for the us benefit plans and 195 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2018 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life 

  

subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

contingent consideration 

in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the company’s creditworthiness a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration although there is no contractual limit total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be 2 million as of december 31 2018 based on the company’s best estimate as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034 

recent accounting standard changes and developments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative transactions 

the company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and as a result the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its nonus dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency 

the company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to 1 naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and 2 mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments the company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows 

  

foreign currency exchange contracts 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated operating assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real 

interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements 

in 2018 the company entered into threeyear interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of 300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its eurodenominated net asset investments under hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation the difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate crosscurrency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

 the following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts in thousands 

 

   

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2018 would decrease pretax earnings by approximately 15 million assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the interest rate crosscurrency swap agreements outstanding as of december 31 2018 would increase by approximately 30 million and would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity the related impact on interest income would not have a material effect on pretax earnings 

the company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper as of december 31 2018 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits and corporate debt securities as of december 31 2018 the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio 

the company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2018 and 2017 471 million out of 1735 million and 3326 million out of 3394 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries in addition 251 million out of 1735 million and 304 million out of 3394 million of cash cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the us dollar at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively as of december 31 2018 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2018 would decrease by approximately 25 million of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to understand diseases identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by hplc in addition in using the acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages the acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2015 the company introduced the acquity ® arc system and its enabling arc multiflow path tm technology which bridges the gap between hplc and uplc by emulating a variety of hplc systems without altering the method’s gradient table and enabling improved chromatographic performance of methods by leveraging 2527 micron particle column technologies 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated and high sample throughput testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from opticalbased ultraviolet “uv” absorbance refractive index and fluorescence detectors to a suite of msbased detectors optimized for certain analyses 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins as a pressurized sample is introduced to the column inlet and permeates through the packed column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica and polymeric resins packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2015 the company introduced the oasis ® prime hlb cartridges which process 

  

samples up to 40 faster and deliver samples that are up to 70 cleaner with fewer lcms matrix effects than samples prepared using other extraction techniques in addition the acquity uplc ® glycoprotein beh amide columns were introduced in 2015 to help biopharmaceutical companies to better understand where glycan groups bonded sugars are located within the therapeutic proteins they are developing and manufacturing in 2016 the company continued to expand its column chemistry capabilities through the introduction of cortecs ® c 8  cortecs ® phenyl cortecs ® t3 and cortecs ® shield rp18 

the company’s precision chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products including certified reference materials “crm”s and proficiency testing “pt” products laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company is a technology and market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments and components these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem msms to maximize the speed andor efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and ion mobility designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental clinical and nutritional safety testing the overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system and a liquid compatible interface such as an electrospray ionization source as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo ® tq and xevo ® tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2015 the company introduced the glycoworks ® rapi fluorms ® nglycan kit which enables fast deglycosylation and labeling reduces sample preparation time and allows mass detection for characterization and development with enhanced sensitivity in 2016 the company introduced the xevo ® tqxs mass spectrometry system enabled by the newly designed stepwave tm sx ion guide which features a unique combination of ion optics detection and ionization technologies resulting in levels of sensitivity not previously seen the company also introduced sonar in 2016 which is a new data acquisition technology for use with the xevo g2xs that allows for the quantification and identification of lipids metabolites and proteins in complex samples in a more efficient manner 

in november 2015 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of mpe orbur group limited and its sole operating subsidiary midland precision equipment company ltd “mpe” a manufacturer of ms 

  

instrumentation components for 12 million net of cash acquired mpe is a highly skilled manufacturer and former waters supplier that produces critical components that support the company’s ms instrument systems 

lc and ms are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it has become common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters operating segment to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publiclydisclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc and lcms instrument systems chromatography columns and other consumables and related services

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 and 69 of the company’s net sales in 2017 and 2016 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk voting to exit the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 56 of the company’s net sales in both 2017 and 2016 were to the worldwide pharmaceutical 

  

and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons some of which include increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized these new products will be sold into both the clinical and nonclinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

in addition despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

  

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees with the exception of the president and chief executive officer and the senior vice president and chief financial officer have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products 

the company sells some products through third parties including distributors and valueadded resellers this exposes us to various risks including competitive pressure concentration of sales volumes credit risks and 

  

compliance risks we may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings distributors may also face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act or similar antibribery laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could materially impact our business risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

the company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws including laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation informally referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” the 2017 tax act changed the us tax system to a territorial tax system including base broadening measures on nonus earnings whereby historical unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deemed to have been repatriated to the us in 2017 regardless of when the assets are actually remitted to the us as well as reducing or eliminating certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation earnings deemed to have been distributed to the us in accordance with the aforementioned 2017 tax act deemed distribution rules are subject to a transition toll tax “transition tax” which is a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the accumulated foreign earnings that have not been previously taxed to the extent those earnings are deemed to have been invested in cash and cash equivalents they will be taxed at a rate of 155 the remainder of those earnings will be taxed at a rate of 80 as a result the company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings were deemed repatriated in 2017 and the company incurred a 550 million estimated tax provision which primarily consisted of an estimated transition 

  

tax as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a provision associated with the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35 to the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest the final impact of the 2017 tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations analysis and assumptions made by the company additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of the treasury and tax planning actions that the company may undertake 

the company continues to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to the unremitted earnings that were taxed we will continue to evaluate our assertions including intentions and plans on the cumulative historical outside basis differences not related to the unremitted earnings that were taxed in our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the sec we expect to finalize our analysis and accounting related to the toll charge deferred tax assets and liabilities and any remaining outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries during the measurement period however there can be no assurance given that these amounts will not need to be revised in the future affecting the future financial condition and results of operations of the company 

going forward the company estimates that its effective tax rate will increase approximately one to three percentage points in the future however there can be no assurance given that the estimated future effective income tax rate increase will not be different and there can be no assurances that it will not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company expects to continue to meet currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized any uncertain tax benefit in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore in the event that it appears that the milestone targets will not be met the company will no longer be entitled to a 0 contractual tax rate benefit on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 at which time all tax benefits previously recorded would be reversed and an income tax charge equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period would be recorded 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings whether or not they have merit in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow 

the company had 1998 million in debt and 3394 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 498 million from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt was in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs in the us a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 3326 million of the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2017 the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments generated from foreign subsidiaries have effectively been repatriated to the us providing the company with the ability to access the cash cash equivalents and investments to satisfy us cash requirements however the company’s financial condition and results of operations could still be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through 1 cash from operations 2 the company’s ability to access its existing 

  

cash and revolving credit facility 3 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements which may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition as of december 31 2017 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

if the company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure research and development efforts or manufacturing operations the company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable the information the company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access acquisition or modification the company’s brand and reputation could be damaged the services that the company provides to its customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using the company’s products and services all of which could reduce the company’s revenue and earnings increase its expenses and expose the company to legal claims and regulatory actions 

the company is in the business of designing manufacturing selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety and environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications and the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that support instrument systems many of the company’s customers are in highly regulated industries while the company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations products and services and the internal and external data managed by the company there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats the company also has acquired companies products services and technologies over time and may inherit risk when integrating these acquisitions into the company in addition at times the company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems these risks will increase as the company continues to grow and expand geographically and its systems products and services become increasingly digital and sensor and webbased 

  

the company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to acquisition of or modification to the company’s technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the company such an incident could disrupt the company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services this could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them as well as to lawsuits regulatory investigations claims or legal liability including contractual liability costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport privacy and data protection fcpa and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations and the european union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information such as information related to health could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the company’s products or services any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against the company or levied by governmental entities or others or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the company’s reputation 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational safety and health administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

as a publiclytraded company the company is subject to the rules of the sec and the new york stock exchange in addition the company must comply with the sarbanesoxley rules which require the company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly while we continue to enhance our controls we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses failure to comply with such rules or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operations which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as 

  

conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in 2016 the company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products however the company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries the company is in the process of evaluating its 2017 supply chain and the company plans to file its 2017 form sd with the sec in may 2018 the results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets 

the company sponsors various retirement plans both inside and outside the us any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the company’s cash flows or results of operations in connection with these retirement plans the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets for example changes in longterm interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense in addition changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws 

estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the company’s results from operations are dependent on future results which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies the company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition product returns and allowances bad debts inventory valuation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions litigation retirement plan obligations stockbased compensation equity investments business combinations and asset acquisitions uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states united kingdom ireland and germany in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather and geological conditions or events including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of 

  

these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company

the company has two operating segments waters ® and ta ®  waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” mass spectrometry “ms” and precision chemistry consumable products and related services ta products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety environmental academic and governmental customers these customers use the company’s products to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals pharmaceuticals water polymers metals and viscous liquids in various industrial consumer goods and healthcare products 

the company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 in 2017 the company’s sales increased 7 as compared to 2016 this growth was balanced across all customer and product classes instrument system sales increased 6 and 4 in 2017 and 2016 respectively the increased demand for instrument system sales in 2017 was balanced across our lcms and ta instrument systems while the increase in 2016 was primarily due to lcms instrument systems recurring revenues combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services increased 7 and 8 in 2017 and 2016 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales 

geographically the company experienced 10 sales growth in both europe and asia in 2017 while sales in the americas was flat in 2017 as compared to the previous year the americas’ sales growth was negatively impacted by natural disasters in the us mexico and puerto rico as well as weaker customer sentiment in the first half of 2017 europe’s sales growth can be primarily attributed to the increase in customer demand from the improvement in the european economy as well as the effect of foreign currency translation which added 2 to 

  

sales growth in 2017 asia’s sales growth was a result of the doubledigit sales growth in china and india on strong demand for our products and services in those countries and in spite of lower customer demand in india in the second half of 2017 resulting from the implementation of the new goods and services tax system 

in 2016 the company’s sales grew 6 as compared to 2015 with strong sales in our pharmaceutical and industrial markets including balance across all product classes the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 1 in 2017 and decreased sales by 1 in 2016 across all products and services recent acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2017 and 2016 

sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 7 and 9 in 2017 and 2016 respectively these increases were driven by the increasing need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs geographically the growth within our pharmaceutical market in 2017 was driven by doubledigit growth in china india and europe while sales growth in 2016 was driven by doubledigit growth in china and japan 

combined sales to industrial customers which includes materials characterization food environmental and fine chemical markets grew 4 and 6 in 2017 and 2016 respectively the growth in both 2017 and 2016 was driven by recent product introductions and rising global regulatory standards in both food and materials markets geographically industrial market sales growth was highest in china and india in 2017 with modest growth in other regions offset by flat sales in the americas in 2016 industrial market sales growth was highest in europe followed by asia and offset by weakness in the us 

combined sales to governmental and academic customers increased 8 in 2017 and decreased 4 in 2016 the increase in sales to governmental and academic customers in 2017 was broadbased across all geographies with doubledigit growth in europe and the americas the decreases in 2016 were a result of these institutions reducing their spending on the company’s products in 2016 combined sales to governmental and academic customers grew in china and india but declined in all other regions sales to governmental and academic customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and as such sales growth rates can vary significantly from period to period 

operating income was 662 million in 2017 an increase of 6 as compared to 2016 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2017 being somewhat offset by the impact of 13 million of severance costs primarily associated with the closure of a facility in germany and costs associated with providing us employees with an early retirement transition incentive an 11 million litigation settlement provision and related costs and a 5 million charge relating to a milestone payment for the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized the change in operating income in 2017 as compared with 2016 was also impacted by 4 million of expense in 2017 related to the acceleration of certain stock awards as compared to 7 million of similar expense in 2016 operating income increased 10 in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of higher sales volumes achieved in 2016 and the positive impact of foreign currency translation on our uk manufacturing and research and development costs as a result of the significantly weaker british pound 

the provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a 550 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of the legislation informally referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” which was signed into law on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act changed the us tax system to a territorial system including base broadening measures requiring the taxation of the company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings through a deemed repatriation which resulted in a 550 million income tax provision that reduced net income per share by 682 for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 as well as eliminating or reducing certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation the 550 million income tax provision primarily consists of an estimated transition toll tax “transition tax” of 490 million as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes of 40 million and a 20 million provision associated with the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

from 35 to the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest as a result of the 2017 tax act the company was able to gain access to its cash and investment balances held outside the us in a tax efficient manner that can be used for any general corporate purposes in the us going forward the company estimates that its effective income tax rate will increase approximately one to three percentage points in the future the final impact of the 2017 tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations analysis and assumptions made by the company additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of the treasury and tax planning actions that the company may undertake 

in the first quarter of 2017 the company adopted a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefit or deficiency on stockbased compensation to be included in the statement of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes whereas previously it was recognized in equity as a result the company recorded a tax benefit on stockbased compensation in 2017 that decreased income tax expense by 20 million and added 024 to net income per diluted share respectively additionally this standard required the company to present the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating activity whereas in the past this tax benefit was reflected as a financing activity all prior periods presented in the cash flow have been adjusted accordingly 

the company generated 698 million 643 million and 573 million of net cash flows from operations in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increases in operating cash flow in each year were primarily a result of the increase in sales and operating income beginning in 2018 and for the next four years the company is required to make annual us federal tax payments of approximately 40 million to tax authorities in connection with the estimated 550 million 2017 tax act liabilities the remaining 60 of this liability is required to be paid over a threeyear period beginning in 2023 also as a result of the 2017 tax act the company is expecting to make 40 million in state and withholding tax payments during 2018 

cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization of 85 million 95 million and 100 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in 2017 the company made a 7 million payment for an investment in a developer of analytical system solutions used to make measurements predict stability and accelerate product discovery in the routine analytic process monitoring and quality control release processes for life science and biopharmaceutical markets in addition the company made a milestone payment of 5 million in 2017 to acquire and license intellectual property in september 2016 the company acquired rubotherm gmbh for approximately 6 million in cash in february 2018 the company’s board of directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations the company anticipates spending an estimated 215 million to build and equip this new stateoftheart manufacturing facility which will be paid for with existing cash and investments and the company does not expect to issue any debt in relation to this expansion 

in november 2017 the company entered into a new credit agreement the “2017 credit agreement” that provides for a 15 billion revolving facility and a 300 million term loan the revolving facility and term loan both mature on november 30 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date the company used 13 billion of the proceeds from the 2017 credit agreement to repay the outstanding amounts under the company’s existing multiborrower credit agreement dated june 2013 the “2013 credit agreement” which was terminated early without penalty in may 2017 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 1 billion of its outstanding common stock over a threeyear period during 2017 2016 and 2015 the company repurchased 323 million 318 million and 327 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under authorized share repurchase programs the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits especially now that the 2017 tax act provides the company with access to its offshore cash at much lower income tax rates as a result the company currently anticipates using 1 billion of cash repatriated into the us to reduce debt and repurchase common stock shares on the open market during 2018 

  

results of operations 

sales by geography 

geographic sales information is presented below for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in thousands

in 2016 sales growth in the us was driven by increases in recurring revenues which were offset by declines in instrument systems sales us sales increased to pharmaceutical customers but declined to nonpharmaceutical endmarkets europe’s sales in 2016 were also driven by recurring revenues and primarily due to increases to pharmaceutical and industrial customers china achieved strong sales growth in all product and customer classes in 2016 with doubledigit growth in lcms instrument systems and precision chemistry consumables as well as doubledigit growth to pharmaceutical customers japan’s increase in sales in 2016 was largely driven by the benefit of foreign currency translation which increased sales by 12 the increase in sales in the rest of asia in 2016 was driven by lcms instrument systems and precision chemistry consumables sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers sales to the rest of asia decreased 6 due to the negative effect of foreign currency translation sales in the rest of the world in 2016 were broadbased across all product classes as sales increased to industrial customers but declined across all other customer classes

ta product and services net sales 

net sales for ta products and services are as follows for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in thousands 

 

 ta instrument system sales rebounded across all major product categories after a flat sales growth in 2016 in 2017 ta instrument system sales grew from thermal instrument systems which were fueled by continued acceptance of the recently introduced discovery product line in addition ta’s rheology instrument systems saw strong performance across the entire range of products in the portfolio driven by the discovery hybrid rheometer and rubber rheometer instrument systems ta service sales increased in both 2017 and 2016 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers the effect of foreign currency translation and recent acquisitions had a minimal impact on ta’s sales in both 2017 and 2016

cost of sales 

the increase in cost of sales for both 2017 and 2016 were consistent with the increase in sales volumes the effect of foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on cost of sales in 2017 in 2016 cost of sales included the benefit of a weaker british pound which reduced the company’s uk manufacturing costs when translated into us dollars 

cost of sales are affected by many factors including but not limited to foreign currency translation product mix product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms at current foreign currency exchange rates the company expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may increase sales and still negatively impact gross profit during 2018 as the foreign currency translation benefit expected on euro and japanese yen sales would be somewhat mitigated by the unfavorable effect of a stronger british pound on the company’s uk manufacturing costs 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 6 in 2017 and increased 3 in 2016 selling and administrative expenses in both 2017 and 2016 were impacted by headcount additions and higher merit compensation costs as well as 4 million and 7 million respectively of stock compensation expense related to the modification of certain stock awards upon the retirement of senior executives in 2017 the company incurred 13 million of severance costs in connection with the closure of a facility in germany and an early retirement transition incentive program severancerelated costs in 2016 and 2015 were 3 million and 3 million respectively in connection with a reduction in workforce the effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 3 in 2017 and lowered these expenses by 2 in 2016

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses increased 6 in both 2017 and 2016 research and development expenses in both 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional headcount merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives in addition the effect of foreign currency translation reduced research and development expenses by 4 and 7 in 2017 and 2016 respectively primarily due to the weakening of the british pound on the company’s ukbased research and development expenses in 2016 research and development expenses also included a benefit of 2 million from a government grant 

acquired inprocess research and development 

during 2017 and 2015 the company incurred charges of 5 million and 4 million respectively for acquired inprocess research and development related to milestone payments associated with a licensing arrangement for certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date these licensing arrangements are significantly related to new biologicallyfocused applications as well as other applications and require the company to make additional future payments of up to 7 million if certain milestones are achieved as well as royalties on future net sales these future payments may be significant and occur over multiple years

interest expense net 

the decreases in net interest expense in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to higher income earned on increased cash cash equivalents and investment balances 

provision for income taxes 

the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the us ireland the uk and singapore where the marginal effective tax rates were approximately 375 125 1925 and 0 respectively as of december 31 2017 the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 on qualifying activities in singapore through march 2021 based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones which the company expects to continue to meet the current statutory tax rate in singapore is 17 the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income in 2017 2016 and 2015 by 25 million 23 million and 20 million respectively and increased the company’s net income per diluted share by 031 029 and 025 respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors including but not limited to the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction changes in tax laws tax rates and policies the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation as a result of variability in these factors the company’s effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years 

the company’s effective tax rates were 968 131 and 134 in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a 550 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of the 2017 tax act excluding the 550 million income tax expense for the 2017 tax act the effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 110 and this effective income tax rate includes a 20 million or 31 percentage point reduction in the income tax expense as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stockbased compensation see note 2 for further information regarding the adoption of this standard 

the 2017 tax act changed the us tax system to a territorial system including base broadening measures requiring the taxation of the company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings through a deemed repatriation which resulted in a 550 million income tax provision that reduced net income per share by 682 for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 as well as eliminating or reducing certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation the 550 million income tax provision primarily consists of an estimated transition tax of 490 million as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes of 40 million and a 20 million provision associated with the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35 to the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest the final impact of the 2017 tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations analysis and assumptions made by the company additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of the treasury and tax planning actions that the company may undertake 

the income tax provision for 2016 included a 3 million tax benefit related to a release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss carryforwards in 2015 the income tax provision included a 3 million tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations the remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pretax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively the company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to shipment of the instrument at december 31 2017 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of 167 million and 26 million respectively revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenue until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company generally structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases destinationbased shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

  

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is accounted for in accordance with multipleelement revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours 

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales of standalone software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and recognized as revenue 

returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales rights of return are not included in sales arrangements revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2017 was 534 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 9 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2017 was recorded at its net realizable value of 270 million which is net of writedowns of 23 million

 when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 228 million 349 million and 360 million respectively as of december 31 2017

 income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates in addition as a result of the timing of the new 2017 tax act in the us the company has had to make reasonable estimates on certain amounts related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings based on the existing interpretations of the us department of the treasury and state and local governments these processes involve the company estimating its actual current tax exposure taking into account the amount timing and character of taxable income tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws regulations agreements treaties and any new interpretations on the taxation of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods such changes could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

  

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2017 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 7 million 

the company has been granted a 0 contractual tax rate in singapore that requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the company expects to meet to the extent not already achieved by december 31 2020 and maintain through at least march 31 2021 as part of the company’s determination of uncertain tax positions the company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved these milestones were negotiated with the singaporean tax authorities and established based on the company’s historical financial performance the anticipated customer endmarket demand particularly in certain regions in the world and the company’s anticipated future operating plans these assessments require significant judgments and estimates about the company’s ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center the company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones and the company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved these milestones are very similar in nature to the previous singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the company successfully completed these milestones are not required to be met until december 21 2020 at the earliest which gives the company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones 

currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized an uncertain tax benefit in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore however these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in singapore and the company’s overall financial performance and in the event that the company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met the company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0 contractual tax rate on income earned in singapore from and after the april 1 2016 start date of the contract period at such time the company would record an income tax charge on the affected singapore income earned back to april 1 2016 at the singapore statutory tax rates currently 17 with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet for the year ended 2017 the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income and net income per diluted share by 25 million and 031 respectively 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the 2017 tax act which changed the us tax system to a territorial tax system including base broadening measures on nonus earnings whereby foreign earnings are effectively deemed to be repatriated to the us as well as reducing or eliminating certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation included in the 2017 tax act is a transition tax which is a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the accumulated foreign earnings that have not been previously taxed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents will be taxed at a rate of 155 and all other earnings will be taxed at a rate of 80 as a result the company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings were deemed repatriated in 2017 and the company incurred a 550 million estimated tax provision which primarily consisted of an estimated transition tax as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a provision associated with the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35 to the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 the transition tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest the final 

  

impact of the 2017 tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations analysis and assumptions made by the company additional guidance that may be issued by the us department of the treasury and tax planning actions that the company may undertake 

in accordance with guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 the final determination of the transition tax and the remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available but no later than one year from the date of enactment of the 2017 tax act 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2017 the company’s warranty liability was 13 million 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 653 for its us benefit plans and 264 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2017 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2017 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 394 for the us benefit plans and 179 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes 

  

option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2017 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

contingent consideration 

in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims 

  

technology in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the company’s creditworthiness a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration although there is no contractual limit total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be 3 million as of december 31 2017 based on the company’s best estimate as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034 

recent accounting standard changes and developments 

information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and as a result the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its nonus dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency 

the company’s principal strategy in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment 

principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the company held foreign currency exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 147 million 120 million and 116 million respectively 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

   

the following is a summary of the activity included in cost of sales in the statements of operations related to the foreign currency exchange contracts in thousands 

 

 assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2017 would decrease pretax earnings by approximately 15 million 

the company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper as of december 31 2017 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in us treasury bills us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits and corporate debt securities the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2017 and 2016 3326 million out of 3394 million and 2766 million out of 2813 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries in addition 304 million out of 3394 million and 261 million out of 2813 million of cash cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the us dollar at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as of december 31 2017 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2017 would decrease by approximately 30 million of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate identify and quantify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to understand diseases identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplcbased methodologies 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using the acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages the acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2012 the company introduced ultraperformance convergence chromatography ® “upc 2 ® ” with the release of the acquity ® upc 2 ® system this new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography “sfc” with the proven uplc technology using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase by varying mobile phase strength pressure temperature and stationary phase with upc 2  a user can separate detect and quantify structural analogs isomers enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures — all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories in 2014 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® mclass instrument system this system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules particularly when used with advanced mass spectrometric characterization the innovations incorporated into the acquity uplc mclass system are led by its internal lowvolume design and newly redesigned fluidics that minimize dispersive and adsorptive losses during a chromatographic separation in 2015 the company introduced the acquity ® arc system and its enabling arc multiflow path tm technology which bridges the gap between hplc and uplc by emulating a variety of hplc systems without altering the method’s gradient table and enabling improved chromatographic performance of methods by leveraging 2527 micron particle column technologies 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the 

  

chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins as the sample permeates through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica and polymeric resins packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2014 the company expanded its cortecs ® family with a new line of 27 micron silicabased solidcore particle columns for usage on uplc as well as hplc systems in addition the company introduced size exclusion chromatography columns for the characterization of proteins and acquity upc 2 columns for chiral and achiral separations in 2015 the company introduced the oasis ® prime hlb cartridges which process samples up to 40 faster and deliver samples that are up to 70 cleaner with fewer lcms matrix effects than samples prepared using other extraction techniques in addition the acquity uplc ® glycoprotein beh amide columns were introduced in 2015 to help biopharmaceutical companies to better understand where glycan groups bonded sugars are located within the therapeutic proteins they are developing and manufacturing in 2016 the company continued to expand its column chemistry capabilities through the introduction of cortecs ® c 8  cortecs ® phenyl cortecs ® t3 and cortecs ® shield rp18 in addition the company expanded its torus tm sfc column line through the introduction of four new preparative sfc columns which are typically larger diameter columns designed for purification laboratories investigating drug compounds natural products or synthetic chemicals 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products including certified reference materials crms and proficiency testing pt products laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis for example the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins fungal biological contaminants in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of fluorimetry hplc or lcms in 2014 the company introduced the aflav ® aqua test strips for detecting aflatoxins in grain and received usdagipsa certification for its aflav ® lateral flow strip tests for the quantitative analysis of total aflatoxins in corn in 2016 the company announced a single extraction method for the detection of aflatoxins and fumonisins in corn and grain using the aflav ® aqua and fumov ® aqua 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company believes it is a technology and market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the speed andor efficacy of certain experiments

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 69 and 68 of the company’s net sales in 2016 and 2015 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the political regulatory and economic environment in particular uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy the effect of the uk voting to exit the european union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions both inside and outside the us may affect the demand for the company’s products and services this may result in a decline in sales in the future increased rate of order cancellations or delays increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

  

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 56 and 54 of the company’s net sales in 2016 and 2015 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the cost to the company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons some of which include increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

strategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market which could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before 

  

significant robust sales will be realized these new products will be sold into both the clinical and nonclinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

in addition despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service the company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly this could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services create security vulnerabilities in the company’s products or services and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services if the company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware or new versions thereof its sales could be affected and revenues could decline errors in software or hardware could expose the company to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation which could impact future sales 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us 

the company had 1827 million in debt and 2813 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 468 million from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs in the us a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 2766 million of the company’s cash held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through 1 cash from us operations 2 efficient costeffective and timely distribution of cash from nonus subsidiaries 3 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility 4 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 5 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england solihull england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various 

  

other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees with the exception of the president and chief executive officer and the senior vice president and chief financial officer have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

  

governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability in addition the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 through march 2021 based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones which the company expects to continue to meet currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized an uncertain tax benefit in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore in the event that it appears that the milestone targets will not be met the company will no longer be entitled to a 0 contractual tax rate benefit on income earned in singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement april 1 2016 at which time all tax benefits previously recorded would be reversed and an income tax charge equal to the statutory tax of 17 on income earned during that period would be recorded 

as a global business the company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world the company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits investigation and proceedings whether or not they have merit in addition the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

if the company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure research and development efforts or manufacturing operations the company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable the information the company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access acquisition or modification the company’s brand and reputation could be damaged the services that the company provides to its customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using the company’s products and services all of which could reduce the company’s revenue and earnings increase its expenses and expose the company to legal claims and regulatory actions 

the company is in the business of designing manufacturing selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety and environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications and the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that support instrument systems many of the company’s customers are in highly regulated industries while the company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations products and services and the internal and external data managed by the company there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats the company also has acquired companies products services and technologies over time and may inherit risk when integrating these acquisitions into the company in addition at times the company faces attempts by third parties to defeat 

  

its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems these risks will increase as the company continues to grow and expand geographically and its systems products and services become increasingly digital and sensor and webbased 

the company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to acquisition of or modification to the company’s technology infrastructure research and development processes manufacturing operations its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the company such an incident could disrupt the company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services this could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them as well as to lawsuits regulatory investigations claims or legal liability including contractual liability costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport privacy and data protection the foreign corrupt practices act and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations and the european union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information such as information related to health could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the company’s products or services any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against the company or levied by governmental entities or others or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the company’s reputation 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational safety and health administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets 

the company sponsors various retirement plans both inside and outside the us any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the company’s cash flows or results of operations in connection with these retirement plans the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets for example changes in longterm interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense in addition changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws 

estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the company’s results from operations are dependent on future results which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies the company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition product returns and allowances bad debts inventory valuation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions litigation retirement plan obligations stockbased compensation equity investments and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company

the company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 in thousands except per share data 

 

 in 2016 the company’s sales increased 6 as compared to 2015 the growth was mainly driven by continued strength in our pharmaceutical market followed by growth in our industrial market which includes sales to industrial chemical nutritional safety and environmental customers offset by a decline in sales to our governmental and academic customers instrument systems produced midsingledigit sales growth during 2016 and our chemistry and service businesses continued to generate highsingledigit growth rates due to higher instrument utilization and a growing base of installed instrument systems geographically the company experienced positive sales growth in all major regions on a worldwide basis led by asia which generated doubledigit growth during 2016 this doubledigit sales growth rate in asia was primarily attributed to strong demand for the company’s products and services in china and a favorable effect of foreign currency translation in japan sales growth in 2016 in europe and the us was 4 and 1 respectively in 2015 the company’s sales grew 3 as compared to 2014 as the effect of foreign currency translation significantly reduced the sales growth rate experienced by the pharmaceutical and industrial endmarkets the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 1 and 6 across all products and services in 2016 and 2015 respectively based on current foreign exchange rates the company expects that foreign currency translation may negatively affect sales growth in 2017 recent acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2016 and 2015 

sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 9 and 4 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in 2016 was driven by the increasing need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs geographically the growth within our pharmaceutical market was driven by doubledigit growth in china and japan while sales growth in 2015 was driven by doubledigit growth in the us china and india offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation 

combined sales to industrial customers grew 6 and 4 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the growth in 2016 was driven by the increasing need for food quality and food safety testing and fine chemical applications geographically industrial market sales growth was highest in europe followed by asia and offset by weakness 

  

in the us before the effects of foreign currency translation the company’s industrial customer sales in 2015 grew at a higher rate than 2016 this overall weaker demand from the company’s industrial customers in 2016 was primarily attributed to the decline in ta instrument system sales and the overall soft demand for the company products and services in the us 

combined sales to governmental and academic customers decreased 4 and 5 in 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result of these institutions reducing their spending on the company’s products and the negative effects of foreign currency translation in 2015 in 2016 combined sales to governmental and academic customers grew in china and india but declined in all other regions in 2015 combined sales to governmental and academic customers grew in the us and china but declined in all other regions 

instrument system sales increased 4 and 3 in 2016 and 2015 respectively due to higher demand for lc and lcms instrument systems this strength in demand was driven by hplc uplc ®  acquity arc tm  qda ® and vion ® ims qtof tm instrument systems as well as other lcms systems that incorporate the company’s benchtop tandem quadrupole technologies recurring revenues combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 8 and 2 in 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales foreign currency translation lowered the 2015 recurring revenues by 6 

geographically sales in asia increased 13 and 9 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the sales growth in asia was a result of the broadbased increase in china’s sales across all product and customer classes and the favorable effect of foreign currency in japan where foreign currency translation increased sales by 12 in 2016 after decreasing sales by 12 in 2015 sales in the us in 2016 increased 1 after the us delivered sales growth of 10 in 2015 when the company experienced greater demand for its products and services in the us 

sales in europe and in the rest of the world increased by 4 and 6 respectively in 2016 as compared to an 8 decline in both europe and the rest of the world sales in 2015 the negative effects of foreign currency translation on the 2016 sales growth in europe and the rest of the world was approximately 3 which was significantly less than the 14 decrease in europe and the 5 decrease in the rest of the world sales in 2015 when the us dollar strengthened substantially against all currencies throughout the world 

operating income was 624 million in 2016 an increase of 10 as compared to 2015 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2016 and the positive impact of foreign currency translation on our uk manufacturing and research and development costs as a result of the significantly weaker british pound operating income increased 10 in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of higher sales volumes achieved in 2015 being partly offset by a 56 million reduction in operating income from the adverse effects of foreign currency translation 

the company generated 629 million 560 million and 512 million of net cash flows from operations in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the increases in operating cash flow in each year were primarily a result of the increase in sales and net income 

cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization of 95 million 100 million and 91 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in september 2016 the company acquired rubotherm gmbh for approximately 6 million in cash and the company made payments of 3 million and 15 million to acquire and license intellectual property during 2015 and 2014 respectively these acquisitions did not have a significant impact on the company’s sales and profits in 2016 

during 2016 and 2014 the company issued and sold senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of 250 million and 200 million respectively during 2016 2015 and 2014 the company repurchased 318 million 327 million and 329 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under 

  

authorized share repurchase programs the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits

ta product and services net sales 

net sales for ta products and services are as follows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 in thousands 

 

 ta instrument system sales were flat in 2016 primarily due to weaker demand for its instrument systems the increase in ta instrument system sales growth in 2015 was primarily attributable to ta’s thermal physical properties instruments in addition ta’s core thermal analysis instrument systems sales rebounded in 2015 after a decrease in 2014 in comparison to stronger sales in 2013 ta service sales increased in both 2016 and 2015 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers the effect of foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on sales in 2016 and decreased ta’s sales by 5 in 2015 recent acquisitions added approximately 1 and 3 to ta’s sales in 2016 and 2015 respectively

cost of sales 

the increase in cost of sales for both 2016 and 2015 were consistent with the increase in sales volumes in 2016 cost of sales included the benefit of a weaker british pound which reduced the company’s uk manufacturing costs when translated into us dollars the weakening of the british pound began with the announcement that the uk would be exiting the european union the effect of foreign currency translation benefited cost of sales in 2015 but increased cost of sales in 2014 

cost of sales are affected by many factors including but not limited to foreign currency translation product mix product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms at current foreign currency exchange rates the company expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may negatively impact gross profit in 2017 as the benefits from the weakening of the british pound are expected to be offset by the impact of the weakening of all other major currencies 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 3 in 2016 and decreased 3 in 2015 selling and administrative expenses in 2016 and 2015 were impacted by headcount additions and higher merit compensation costs and the effect of foreign currency translation which lowered selling and administrative expenses by 2 and 7 in 2016 and 2015 respectively in addition the company incurred 7 million of stock compensation expense in 2016 related to the modification of certain stock awards upon the retirement of senior executives severancerelated costs in 2016 2015 and 2014 were 3 million 3 million and 6 million respectively in connection with a reduction in workforce in 2014 the company incurred a 5 million impairment charge related to a writedown in the fair value of a building held for sale in the uk this building was sold in 2015 for 5 million in cash

litigation provision 

the company recorded 4 million of litigation settlement provisions and related costs in both 2016 and 2015 

interest expense net 

the decreases in net interest expense in 2016 and 2015 were primarily attributable to higher income earned on increased cash cash equivalents and investment balances

the company’s effective tax rates were 131 134 and 120 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the change in the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pretax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates in addition the income tax provision for 2016 included a 3 million tax benefit related to a release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss carryforwards in 2015 the income tax provision included a 3 million tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent 

  

liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively the company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to shipment of the instrument at december 31 2016 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of 149 million and 25 million respectively revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenue until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company generally structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases destinationbased shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is accounted for in accordance with multipleelement revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours 

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales of standalone software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue 

  

when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and recognized as revenue 

returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales rights of return are not included in sales arrangements revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2016 was 489 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 9 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2016 was recorded at its net realizable value of 263 million which is net of writedowns of 23 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 207 million 337 million and 352 million respectively as of december 31 2016 

  

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units waters and ta the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure taking into account the amount timing and character of taxable income tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods such changes could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

uncertain tax positions 

the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2016 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 10 million 

the company has been granted a 0 contractual tax rate in singapore that requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the company expects to meet to the extent not already achieved by december 31 2020 and maintain through at least march 31 2021 as part of the company’s determination of uncertain tax positions the company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved these milestones were negotiated with the singaporean tax authorities and established based on the company’s historical financial performance the anticipated customer endmarket demand particularly in certain regions in the world and the company’s anticipated future operating plans these assessments require significant judgments and estimates about the company’s ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets meeting capital expenditures targets attaining and sustaining employment targets and establishing a local research and development and service center the company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones and the company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved these milestones are very similar in nature to the previous singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the company successfully completed these milestones are not required to be met until december 21 2020 at the earliest which gives the company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones 

  

currently the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0 and has not recognized an uncertain tax benefit in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore however these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in singapore and the company’s overall financial performance and in the event that the company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met the company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0 contractual tax rate on income earned in singapore from and after the april 1 2016 start date of the contract period at such time the company would record an income tax charge on the affected singapore income earned back to april 1 2016 at the singapore statutory tax rates currently 17 with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet for the year ended 2016 the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company’s net income and net income per diluted share by 23 million and 029 respectively 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2016 the company’s warranty liability was 13 million 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 647 for its us benefit plans and 274 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2016 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2016 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 441 for the us benefit plans and 171 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

  

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards respectively under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2016 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

  

contingent consideration 

in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the company’s creditworthiness a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration although there is no contractual limit total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be 3 million as of december 31 2016 based on the company’s best estimate as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034 

recent accounting standard changes and developments 

information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and as a result the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its nonus dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into us dollars and when any of the company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency 

the company’s principal strategy in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to naturally hedge the foreigncurrencydenominated liabilities on the company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets 

the company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreigncurrencydenominated assets liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet other than a portion of certain thirdparty accounts receivable and accounts payable and the company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables which are eliminated in consolidation the company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the company’s currency price risk exposure the foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment 

principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound mexican peso and brazilian real at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 the company held foreign currency exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 120 million 116 million and 110 million respectively 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

   

the following is a summary of the activity included in cost of sales in the statements of operations related to the foreign currency exchange contracts in thousands 

 

 assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2016 would decrease pretax earnings by approximately 12 million 

the company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper as of december 31 2016 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in us treasury bills us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits and corporate debt securities the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2016 and 2015 2766 million out of 2813 million and 2346 million out of 2399 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities in addition 261 million out of 2813 million and 248 million out of 2399 million of cash cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the us dollar at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as of december 31 2016 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the us dollar as of december 31 2016 would decrease by approximately 26 million of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity

part iv 




 item 1 business tableend general 

waters corporation “waters ® ” or the “company” is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs manufactures sells and services through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” and mass spectrometry “ms” technology systems and support products including chromatography columns other consumable products and comprehensive postwarranty service plans these systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together “lcms” and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform through its ta division “ta ® ” the company primarily designs manufactures sells and services thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that interface with the company’s instruments as well as other suppliers’ instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system 

the company’s products are used by life science including pharmaceutical biochemical industrial nutritional safety environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s lc and lcms instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials and to purify a full range of compounds these instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing lcms instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification the company’s thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals pharmaceuticals water polymers metals and viscous liquids in various industrial consumer goods and healthcare products as well as for life science research 

waters organized as a delaware corporation in 1991 is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary waters became a publiclytraded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of ta instruments in may 1996 and micromass limited “micromass ® ” in september 1997 

business segments 

the company’s business activities for which discrete financial information is available are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker as a result of this evaluation the company determined that it has two operating segments waters division and ta division the company operates in the analytical instruments industry by designing manufacturing distributing and servicing instrument systems columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments the company’s two operating segments waters division and ta division have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes 

information concerning revenues and longlived assets attributable to each of the company’s products services and geographic areas is set forth in note 15 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

waters division 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by life science industries including pharmaceuticals in these markets hplc is used extensively to understand diseases identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2012 the company introduced ultraperformance convergence chromatography tm “upc2 ® ” with the release of the acquity ® upc2 ® system this new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography “sfc” with the proven uplc technology using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase by varying mobile phase strength pressure temperature and stationary phase with upc 2  a user can separate detect and quantify structural analogs isomers enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures – all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories in 2013 the company introduced the acquity ® advanced polymer chromatography ® “apc tm ” system this system delivers improved polymer peak resolution particularly for low molecular weight polymers and oligomers up to 20 times faster than traditional gel permeation chromatography in 2013 the company introduced the acquity ® qda ® detector a compact and easy to operate single quadrupole mass spectrometric module that further supports the broader usage of mass detectors in a form similar to that of the broadly used optical detectors that are routinely used for lc applications the control and data output of the qda is compatible with waters’ most commonly used instrument configurations and the qda is uniquely positioned to offer mass detection to the large and well established markets for hplc and uplc systems in 2014 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® mclass instrument system this system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules particularly when used with mass spectrometric detection the innovations incorporated into the acquity uplc mclass system are led by its internal lowvolume design and newly redesigned fluidics that minimize dispersive and adsorptive losses during a chromatographic separation in 2015 the company introduced the acquity ® arc system and its enabling arc multiflow path tm technology which bridges the gap between hplc and uplc by emulating a variety of hplc systems without altering the method’s gradient table and enabling improved chromatographic performance of methods by leveraging 2527 micron particle column technologies 

  

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample permeates through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2013 the company introduced the cortecs ® family of 16 micron solidcore silicabased uplc columns to further extend the application range and performance of its uplc offerings in 2014 the company expanded its cortecs family with a new line of 27 micron silicabased solidcore particle columns for usage on uplc as well as hplc systems in addition the company introduced size exclusion chromatography columns for the characterization of proteins and acquity upc 2 columns for chiral and achiral separations in 2015 the company introduced the oasis ® prime hlb cartridges which process samples up to 40 faster and deliver samples that are up to 70 cleaner with fewer lcms matrix effects than samples prepared using other extraction techniques in addition the acquity uplc ® glycoprotein beh amide columns were introduced in 2015 to help biopharmaceutical companies to better understand where glycan groups bonded sugars are located within the therapeutic proteins they are developing and manufacturing

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 68 and 70 of the company’s net sales in 2015 and 2014 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political regulatory and economic environment in particular the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition in 2015 the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world and significantly affected the company’s financial performance the continuing strength of the us dollar could continue to have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the near future 

  

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 54 and 53 of the company’s net sales in 2015 and 2014 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons some of which include increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those 

  

of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

the costs of developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market could negatively impact the company’s financial results

 in 2015 the company’s sales increased 3 as compared to 2014 with foreign currency translation reducing sales growth by 6 in 2015 the company experienced strong demand for products and services from life science industrial chemical nutritional safety and environmental customers this strength in demand was driven by doubledigit sales growth in the us china and india while sales in europe japan and the rest of the world declined due to the effect of the strengthening of the us dollar against substantially all currencies throughout the world sales in europe declined 8 where foreign currency translation reduced sales growth by 14 japan sales decreased 11 where foreign currency translation decreased sales by 12 and sales in the rest of the world declined by 8 with foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 5 

instrument system sales increased 3 in both 2015 and 2014 due to higher demand for lc and lcms instrument systems the 2015 instrument systems sales growth was driven by demand for hplc uplc and qda ® instrument systems as well as the newly introduced acquity ® arc instrument system recurring revenues combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 2 and 7 in 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 6 and 2 across all products and services in 2015 and 2014 respectively based on current foreign exchange rates the company expects that foreign currency translation may negatively affect sales growth in 2016 acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2015 and 2014

 operating income was 567 million in 2015 an increase of 10 as compared to 2014 this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2015 being partly offset by a 56 million reduction in operating income from the adverse effects of foreign currency translation operating income was flat in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the increase in sales volume was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation which decreased 2014 operating profit by approximately 22 million in addition operating income was impacted by the following items

undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 218 million 333 million and 357 million respectively as of december 31 2015

 income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money at december 31 2015 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 14 million

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 635 for its us benefit plans and 258 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company utilized milliman’s bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its us benefit plans the company determined the discount rate for its nonus benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2015 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2015 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 459 for the us benefit plans and 223 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

  

as of december 31 2015 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

contingent consideration 

in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the company’s creditworthiness a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration although there is no contractual limit total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be 4 million as of december 31 2015 based on the company’s best estimate as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034

waters division 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their foreign counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2012 the company introduced ultraperformance convergence chromatography tm “upc 2 ® ” with the release of the acquity ® upc 2 ® system this new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography “sfc” with the proven uplc technology using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase by varying mobile phase strength pressure temperature and stationary phase with upc 2  a user can separate detect and quantify structural analogs isomers enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures – all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories in 2013 the company introduced the acquity ® advanced polymer chromatography ® “apc tm ” system this system delivers improved polymer peak resolution particularly for low molecular weight polymers and oligomers up to 20 times faster than traditional gel permeation chromatography in 2013 the company introduced the acquity ® qda ® detector a compact and easy to operate mass spectrometric module that further supports the broader usage of mass detection for routine lc applications in 2014 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® mclass instrument system this system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules particularly when used with mass spectrometric detection the innovations incorporated into the acquity uplc mclass system are led by its internal lowvolume design and newly redesigned fluidics that minimize dispersive and adsorptive losses during a chromatographic separation 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

  

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample permeates through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2013 the company introduced the cortecs ® family of 16 micron solidcore uplc columns to further extend the application range and performance of its uplc offerings in 2014 the company expanded its cortecs family with a new line of 27 micron silicabased solidcore particle columns for usage on uplc as well as hplc systems in addition the company introduced size exclusion chromatography columns for the characterization of proteins and acquity upc 2 columns for chiral and achiral separations 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis for example the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins biological contaminants in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of fluorimetry hplc or lcms in 2014 the company introduced the aflav ® aqua test strips for detecting aflatoxins in grain and received usdagipsa certification for its aflav ® lateral flow strip tests for the quantitative analysis of total aflatoxins in corn 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company believes it is a technology and market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the speed andor efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental clinical and nutritional safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo ® tq and xevo ® tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments 

  

performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2012 the company introduced the xevo ® g2s qtof tm and xevo ® g2s tof mass spectrometers bringing stepwave tm ion technology to its benchtop timeofflight mass spectrometers in 2013 the company introduced the synapt ® g2s i  which combines the unique power of travelling wave “twave tm ” ion mobility separations with new data acquisition and informatics technologies and collision crosssection measurements in 2014 the company introduced the ionkeyms tm system xevo ® g2xs and xevo ® tqs micro the ionkeyms system physically integrates a uplc separation into the mass spectrometer producing a significant improvement in sensitivity with reduced solvent and sample sizes the xevo g2xs mass spectrometer combines the new xs collision cell with the signature technologies of tofmrm stepwave tm and quantof tm  the xevo tqs micro is a more compact researchgrade instrument designed to acquire sensitive robust and dependable data at accelerated rates of acquisition

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political events wars or terrorism and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region these potential political currency and economic disruptions as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 70 of the company’s net sales in both 2014 and 2013 were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political regulatory and economic environment in particular the financial 

  

difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition in late 2014 and early 2015 the us dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies throughout the world the strength of the us dollar may have a significant negative impact on the company’s financial performance in the near future 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 53 and 52 of the company’s net sales in 2014 and 2013 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

  

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales the competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership mergers and continued consolidations among the company’s competitors which could harm the company’s business 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets over the years some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons some of which include increasing product line offerings improving market share and reducing costs there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

the costs of developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies the future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant robust sales will be realized these new products will be sold into both the clinical and nonclinical markets and any new products requiring fda clearance may take longer to bring to market there can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us 

the company had 1465 million in debt and 2055 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 533 million from its existing committed credit facility all but a small portion of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs in the us a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 1971 million of the company’s cash held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through 1 cash from us operations 2 efficient costeffective and timely distribution of cash from nonus subsidiaries 3 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility 4 the ability to expand the company’s borrowing capacity and 5 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in wilmslow england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company in august 2013 the company’s chief executive officer announced his intention to retire as chief executive officer of the company if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions and changing application of tax law 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused 

  

by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations in addition governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport the foreign corrupt practices act and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational safety and health administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in 2013 the company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products however the company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining 

  

countries the company is in the process of evaluating its 2014 supply chain and the company plans to file its 2014 form sd with the sec in may 2015 the results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states united kingdom and ireland in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and financial overview 

the company has two operating segments the waters division and the ta division “ta ® ” the waters division’s products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” mass spectrometry “ms” and chemistry consumable products and related services ta products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial nutritional safety environmental academic and governmental customers these customers use the company’s products to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals pharmaceuticals water polymers and viscous liquids in various industrial consumer goods and healthcare products 

  

the company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 in 2014 the company’s sales reached 2 billion which represented an increase of 4 as compared to 2013 overall 2014 sales benefited from strong demand from the company’s pharmaceutical customers this strength was broadbased and drove midsingle digit sales growth in the us and europe and 18 sales growth in india conversely the company’s 2014 sales were affected by a slower pace of business in china and the negative effect of foreign currency translation primarily caused by the weakening japanese yen 

combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 7 and 4 in 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand instrument system sales increased 3 and 2 in 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2014 instrument systems sales grew due to higher demand for lc and lcms instrument system sales instrument systems sales grew in 2013 as a result of increased demand in highend mass spectrometry core chromatography and ta instrument systems in addition instrument system sales benefited in 2014 and 2013 from the introductions of the acquity ® qda ® detector in late 2013 acquity ® upc 2 ® system and the acquity ® advanced polymer chromatography ® “apc tm ” system acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2014 and 2013 the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2 across all products and services in both 2014 and 2013 based on current foreign exchange rates the company expects that foreign currency translation may have a significant negative effect on sales in 2015 

sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 8 and 1 in 2014 and 2013 respectively sales growth to pharmaceutical customers in 2014 was positive in all regions except japan where sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation combined global sales to governmental and academic customers increased 4 and 8 in 2014 and 2013 respectively combined sales to industrial chemical nutritional safety and environmental customers decreased 1 in 2014 and increased 6 in 

  

2013 the decline in sales to industrial chemical nutritional safety and environmental customers in 2014 is primarily due to weaker industrial chemical customer demand for both waters division and ta division instrument systems 

operating income was flat in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the increase in sales volume was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation which decreased 2014 operating profit by approximately 22 million during 2014 the company incurred a 15 million charge for acquired inprocess research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and significantly related to new medicallyfocused applications as well as other applications in addition 2014 included 6 million of severancerelated costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and a 5 million impairment charge related to a writedown in the fair value of a building held for sale in the uk these expenses were offset slightly by a 2 million award received in 2014 from an arbitration settlement 

the 1 increase in operating income in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the increase in sales volume offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation which decreased 2013 operating profit by approximately 27 million and the increase in amortization expense from the unifi ® software in addition the comparability of 2013 operating income with 2012 operating income was impacted by the 2012 onetime litigation provisions and purchased intangible amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset 

net income per diluted share was primarily affected by the following factors in 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

  

  

  

  

 net cash provided by operating activities was 512 million 485 million and 449 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 27 million increase in operating cash flow in 2014 when compared to 2013 was primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers which improved dayssalesoutstanding “dso” by 1 day at december 31 2014 as compared to december 31 2013 and the timing of payments to vendors the 36 million increase in operating cash flow in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers and the timing of payments to vendors 

within cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization were 91 million 118 million and 105 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively capital expenditures in 2013 and 2012 include multiyear construction projects to accommodate future growth

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units the waters division and ta division the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money at december 31 2014 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 20 million 

  

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2014 the company’s warranty liability was 13 million 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 695 for its us benefit plans and 284 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2014 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2014 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 392 for the us benefit plans and 198 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require 

  

forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2014 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 business combinations and asset acquisitions 

the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations the results of each acquisition are included in the company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired iprd is tested for impairment until completion of the acquired programs upon commercialization this indefinitelived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finitelived intangible asset and amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life subject to periodic impairment reviews if the research and development project is abandoned the indefinitelived asset is charged to expense legal costs due diligence costs business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments contingent upon certain future events iprd acquired in an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset and are classified as intangible assets 

contingent consideration 

in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the company’s creditworthiness a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration although there is no contractual limit total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments are estimated to be 4 million as of december 31 2014 based on the company’s best estimate as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034

information concerning revenues and longlived assets attributable to each of the company’s products services and geographic areas is set forth in note 15 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

waters division 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2011 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® iclass instrument system the acquity uplc iclass provides a powerful solution to a critical need by successfully analyzing compounds that are limited in amount or availability amid a complex matrix the acquity uplc iclass system maximizes peak capacity to enhance ms sensitivity it provides low sample carryover complementing ms sensitivity and extending ms linear dynamic range and it has been purposefully engineered for low dispersion in 2012 the company introduced ultraperformance convergence chromatography tm “upc 2 ® ” with the release of the acquity ® upc2 ® system this new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography “sfc” with the proven uplc technology using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase by varying mobile phase strength pressure temperature and stationary phase with upc2 a user can separate detect and quantify structural analogs isomers enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures – all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories in 2013 the company introduced the acquity ® advanced polymer chromatography ® “apc tm ” system this system delivers improved polymer peak resolution particularly for low molecular weight polymers and oligomers up to 20 times faster than traditional gel permeation chromatography in 2013 the company also introduced the acquity ® qda tm detector which facilitates obtaining mass spectral measurements from chromatographic separations utilizing a compact and easy to operate detector module 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully 

  

automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used primarily on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instruments primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2013 the company introduced the cortecs tm family of 16 micron solidcore uplc columns to further extend the application range and performance of its uplc offerings 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in addition the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins biological contaminants in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of fluorimetry hplc or lcms 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company believes it is a technology and market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental clinical and nutritional safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade in 2013 the company introduced the acquity qda detector a compact and easy to operate mass spectrometric module that further supports the broader usage of mass detection for routine lc applications larger quadrupole 

  

systems such as the xevo ® tq and xevo ® tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2011 the company introduced the synapt ® g2s hdms instrument system the synapt g2s incorporates both high sensitivity waters stepwave tm ion transfer optics and triwave ® ion mobility technologies along with a suite of new informatics tools to enhance qualitative and quantitative high resolution performance in 2012 the company introduced the xevo ® g2s qtof tm and xevo ® g2s tof mass spectrometers bringing stepwave ion technology to its benchtop timeofflight mass spectrometers in 2013 the company introduced the synapt g2s i  which combines the unique power of travelling wave “twave tm ” ion mobility separations with new data acquisition and informatics technologies and collision crosssection measurements 

lc and ms are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it has become common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publiclydisclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc and lcms instrument systems chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading combined lc and lcms market share in the united states europe and asia excluding japan and believes it may have a market share position in japan that ranks second to an established domestic supplier 

the company has been a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that interface with the company’s instruments as well as other manufacturers’ instruments the company recently introduced a new unifi ® software platform the unifi scientific information system is the culmination of a multiyear effort to substantially bring all of waters’ preexisting disparate software systems under one operating system unifi joins waters’ suite of informatics products – empower ®  chromatography data software masslynx ® mass spectrometry software and nugenesis ® scientific data management system each of which is used daily to support innovations within worldleading institutions unifi is the industry’s first comprehensive software that seamlessly integrates uplc chromatography mass spectrometry and informatics data workflows

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm the company’s financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

  

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 52 and 53 of the company’s net sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us 

the company had approximately 1323 million in debt and 1804 million in cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 483 million from its existing committed credit facilities most of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential us acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs in the us a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 1738 million of the company’s cash held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through 1 cash from us operations 2 efficient costeffective and timely distribution of cash from nonus subsidiaries 3 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or 

  

transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in cheshire england manchester england wilmslow england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions in early 2014 the company completed the construction of its new facility in wilmslow england and is in the process of consolidating and moving its cheshire and manchester facilities to this new location any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region currency and economic disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 of the company’s net sales in both 2013 and 2012 were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political regulatory and economic environment in particular the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company in august 2013 the company’s chief executive officer announced his intention to retire as chief executive officer of the company by the end 2015 in addition the company’s former chief financial officer has transitioned to a reduced workload and resigned as the company’s chief financial officer as of february 1 2014 if for any reason other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions and changing application of tax law 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations in addition governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

disruption cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information and webbased systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee 

  

data unauthorized access to and funds transfers from company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states united kingdom and ireland in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and ireland severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport the foreign corrupt practices act and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational health and safety administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules are likely to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products

 sales increased 3 in 2013 as compared to 2012 with combined sales of chemistry consumables and services growing 4 and instrument system sales growing 2 instrument systems sales grew in 2013 as compared to the decline in 2012 as a result of increased demand in highend mass spectrometry core chromatography and ta instrument systems in addition instrument system sales benefited in 2013 from the introduction of the new acquity ® upc 2 ® system acquity ® advanced polymer chromatography ® “apc tm ” system and acquity ® qda tm detector the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted 2013 sales by 2 across all products and services primarily due to a 22 weakening of the japanese yen as compared to the us dollar during 2013 as compared to 2012 acquisitions had an insignificant impact on both 2013 and 2012 sales 

sales were flat in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a 4 increase in combined sales of chemistry consumables and services was offset by a 4 decrease in instrument system sales the decline in instrument system sales in 2012 was generally attributable to timing of capital spending by our customers across all regions except china the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2 in 2012 and increased sales 3 in 2011 

sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 1 in both 2013 and 2012 combined sales to industrial and environmental customers increased 6 in 2013 and decreased 2 in 2012 combined global sales to governmental and academic customers increased 8 in 2013 and decreased 4 in 2012 the increases in sales in 2013 were primarily due to higher customer demand for instrument systems the increase in sales to pharmaceutical customers in 2012 was primarily a result of increased spending on chemistry consumables and services while the decreased sales to other customers in 2012 were primarily attributable to timing of capital spending by our customers as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of the euro and indian rupee 

  

the 1 increase in operating income in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the increase in sales volume offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation which decreased 2013 operating profit by approximately 27 million and the increase in amortization expense from the unifi ® software in addition the comparability of 2013 operating income with 2012 operating income was impacted by the 2012 onetime litigation provisions and purchased intangible amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset 

the decrease in operating income in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to onetime charges included in purchased intangibles amortization and litigation provisions and the effects of foreign currency translation foreign currency translation decreased 2012 operating profit by approximately 14 million and increased 2011 operating profit by approximately 26 million

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively the company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to shipment of the instrument at december 31 2013 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of 128 million and 21 million respectively revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases destinationbased shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is accounted for in accordance with multipleelement revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours 

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over 

  

the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and is recognized as revenue 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2013 was 431 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 7 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2013 was recorded at its net realizable value of 243 million which is net of writedowns of 18 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 239 million 325 million and 350 million respectively as of december 31 2013 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units the waters division and ta division the 

  

company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2013 the company’s warranty liability was 13 million 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of those unrecognized tax benefits associated with those tax reporting positions for the time value of money at december 31 2013 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 25 million 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

  

with respect to the specific claims referenced in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to those claims as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial position 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 694 for its us benefit plans and 240 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2013 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2013 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 482 for the us benefit plans and 329 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

  

as of december 31 2013 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 recent accounting standard changes and developments 

information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euros japanese yen british pounds and singapore dollars the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

derivative transactions 

the company records its derivative transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establish the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities all derivatives whether designated in hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities if the derivative is designated as a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in addition disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the company’s objectives for using derivative instruments the level of derivative activity the company engages in as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company’s financial position and performance 

the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risks the company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposures the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions in addition the company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk 

  

on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts the company also assesses and documents both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances and shortterm assets and liabilities principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound and singapore dollar the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 104 million 134 million and 161 million respectively 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

 the following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign exchange contracts in thousands 

 

 assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2013 would decrease pretax earnings by approximately 10 million 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us and uk treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper investments with longer maturities are classified as investments and are held primarily in us treasury bills canadian government us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits and corporate debt securities the company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than us dollars as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 1738 million out of 1804 million and 1489 million out of 1539 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities as of december 31 2013 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

the company’s cash cash equivalents and investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of december 31 2013 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value

 item 1 business tableend general 

waters corporation “waters ® ” or the “company” is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs manufactures sells and services through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” and mass spectrometry “ms” technology systems and support products including chromatography columns other consumable products and comprehensive postwarranty service plans these systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together “lcms” and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments through its ta division “ta ® ” the company primarily designs manufactures sells and services thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that interface with the company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system 

the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial nutritional safety environmental academic and governmental customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s lc and lcms instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full range of compounds these instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing the company’s thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals pharmaceuticals water polymers and viscous liquids for uses in various industrial consumer goods and healthcare products as well as for life science research 

waters organized as a delaware corporation in 1991 is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary waters became a publiclytraded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of ta instruments in may 1996 and micromass limited “micromass ® ” in september 1997 

business segments 

the company’s business activities for which financial information is available are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers as a result of this evaluation the company determined that it has two operating segments waters division and ta division the company operates in the analytical instruments industry by designing manufacturing distributing and servicing instrument systems columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments the company’s two operating segments waters division and ta division have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes 

information concerning revenues and longlived assets attributable to each of the company’s products services and geographic areas is set forth in note 14 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

waters division 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and 

  

identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and governmental agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2010 waters introduced the acquity uplc ® hclass instrument system which incorporates the performance of acquity uplc with the operational familiarity of traditional hplc systems the acquity uplc hclass is a streamlined system that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of quaternary solvent blending and a flowthrough needle injector to deliver the advanced performance expected of uplctype separations the acquity uplc hclass delivers high resolution sensitivity and improved throughput while maintaining the robustness and reliability for which the acquity systems are known in 2011 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® iclass instrument system the acquity uplc iclass provides a powerful solution to a critical need by successfully analyzing compounds that are limited in amount or availability amid a complex matrix the acquity uplc iclass system maximizes peak capacity to enhance ms sensitivity it provides the lowest carryover complementing ms sensitivity and extending ms linear dynamic range and it has been purposefully engineered for the lowest dispersion in 2012 the company introduced ultraperformance convergence chromatography tm “upc 2™ ” with the release of the acquity ® upc 2™ system this new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography “sfc” with the proven uplc technology using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase by varying mobile phase strength pressure temperature and stationary phase with upc 2  a user can separate detect and quantify structural analogs isomers enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures – all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of 

  

biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument primarily uses acquity uplc columns 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in addition the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” and classic magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental clinical and nutritional safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo ® tq and xevo ® tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2010 the company introduced the xevo tqs instrument system which is designed for the most demanding uplcmsms applications also in 2010 the company introduced the xevo ® g2 qtof tm instrument system the xevo g2 qtof is one of the most sensitive exact mass quantitative and qualitative benchtop msms instrument systems developed because 

  

it combines the integrated workflow benefits of engineered simplicity tm found in existing xevo qtof instrument systems with the quantof tm technology of the synapt ® g2 instrument system in 2011 the company introduced the synapt ® g2s hdms instrument system the synapt g2s incorporates both highsensitivity waters stepwave tm ion transfer optics and triwave ® ion mobility technologies along with a suite of new informatics tools to enhance qualitative and quantitative high resolution performance in 2012 the company introduced the xevo ® g2s qtof tm and xevo ® g2s tof mass spectrometers bringing stepwave ion technology to its benchtop timeofflight mass spectrometers 

lc and ms are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it has become common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm our financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future there can be no assurance regarding demand for the company’s products and services in the future 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital and financial condition 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts 

  

severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the company’s customers changes in governmental regulations particularly affecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to governmental academic and research institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 53 and 52 of the company’s net sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the company’s competitors in the future 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us 

the company had approximately 1178 million in debt and 1539 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 428 million from its existing committed credit facilities most of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 1489 million of the company’s cash held by foreign subsidiaries the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through 1 cash from us operations 2 efficient costeffective and timely distribution of cash from nonus subsidiaries 3 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and 4 other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost 

  

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

disruption of operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the company’s financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political and regulatory changes related to either a specific country or a larger region currency and economic disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 of the company’s net sales in both 2012 and 2011 were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political regulatory and economic environment in particular the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the company’s key management employees have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by wellestablished contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions and changing application of tax law 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations in addition governments in the jurisdictions in which the company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely affect the company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden which would negatively affect the company’s profitability 

disruption or unforeseen problems with the security maintenance or upgrade of the company’s information systems could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company relies on its technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell products and services fulfill contract obligations ship products collect and make payments and otherwise conduct business the company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from but not limited to natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses unauthorized access to customer or employee data and other attempts to harm the company’s systems any prolonged disruption to the company’s technology infrastructure at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states united kingdom and ireland in addition the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and wexford ireland severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunamis could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the company 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport the foreign corrupt practices act and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as the united states occupational health and safety administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

the company is subject to the rules of the sec under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials tantalum tin gold and tungsten known as conflict minerals which may be contained in the company’s products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules are likely to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products

the company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 sales were flat in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a 4 increase in combined sales of chemistry consumables and services was offset by a 4 decrease in instrument system sales the increase in service sales was from higher renewal rates of service plans as well as higher service demand billings from the company’s installed base of customers the decline in instrument system sales was generally attributable to timing of capital spending by our customers across all regions except china as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of both the euro which impacted sales due to the effect of foreign currency translation and indian rupee which effectively increased the price of the systems for certain customers the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted 2012 sales by 2 across all products and services the 2011 increase in sales of 13 as compared to 2010 was attributable to increased spending by the company’s pharmaceutical industrial and chemical analysis customers on new and existing lc ms and ta products the sales growth in 2011 was also attributable to an increase in demand for the acquity uplc ® hclass xevo ® qtof tm  xevo ® tqs and synapt ® g2s instrument systems the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 3 in 2011 and had minimal impact on 2010 sales 

sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 1 and 13 in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in 2012 was primarily a result of increased spending on chemistry consumables and services the increase in 2011 was due to increased sales of instrument systems particularly acquity uplc hclass xevo qtof xevo tqs and synapt g2s instrument systems and chemistry consumables and services combined sales to industrial and environmental customers decreased 2 in 2012 and increased 15 in 2011 combined global sales to governmental and academic customers decreased 4 in 2012 and increased 5 in 2011 the decreases in 2012 sales were primarily attributable to timing of capital spending by our customers as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of the euro and indian rupee while the increases in 2011 were primarily attributable to sales of newly introduced lc and lcms systems as global economic conditions improved as compared to 2010 

  

the 3 decrease in operating income in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to onetime charges included in purchased intangibles amortization and litigation provisions and the effects of foreign currency translation included in purchased intangibles amortization in 2012 is 4 million of amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset the company recorded 7 million of litigation provisions in 2012 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with complaints filed against the company relating to patent infringement lawsuits the company paid 3 million of these litigation provisions in 2012 foreign currency translation decreased 2012 operating profit by approximately 14 million the company expects the impact of foreign currency translation in 2013 to have a neutral effect on sales but negatively impact operating profits when compared to 2012 based on current exchange rates this is primarily due to the mix of sales and costs in japan and europe where a weaker japanese yen is expected to be offset by a stronger euro 

the 17 increase in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily from increases in sales volumes and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 26 million and 6 million of the increase in operating income in 2011 and 2010 respectively

within cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization were 105 million 85 million and 63 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively capital expenditures were higher in 2012 and 2011 due to a multiyear project to consolidate certain existing primary ms research manufacturing and distribution locations as of december 31 2012 the company has spent a total of 52 million related to this project and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of 25 million to 50 million to finish construction of this facility

within cash flows used in financing activities the company received 29 million 60 million and 101 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option grants in may 2012 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 750 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period during 2012 2011 and 2010 the company repurchased 290 million 364 million and 292 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under the may 2012 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits in august 2012 as permitted by the credit agreement dated july 2011 the “2011 credit agreement” the company increased the revolving facility commitment by 200 million bringing the total amount of the revolving facility commitment to 900 million there were no other changes to the terms and conditions of the 2011 credit agreement the company will use the proceeds from the increased revolving facility commitment for general corporate purposes

the company is currently engaged in continuing communications with tax authorities in the us japan and various other jurisdictions regarding examinations of the company’s tax returns related to matters for which the company has previously recorded uncertain tax benefits during 2012 the company did not record any material changes in the measurement of any unrecognized tax benefits related to these ongoing tax audit examinations as of december 31 2012 the company anticipates that it will be able to resolve certain of these ongoing tax audit examinations during the next twelve months as of december 31 2012 the company expects to record a reduction in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties in the range of approximately 5 million to 39 million within the next twelve months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments and the settlement of ongoing tax audit examinations and does not otherwise expect to record any other material changes within the next twelve months these amounts have been classified as accrued income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company has not paid any dividends and has no plans at this time to pay any dividends in the future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has not created and is not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated to the extent of the company’s ownership interest therein into the consolidated financial statements the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company 

the company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business pursuant to these agreements the company indemnifies holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for 

  

losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party generally the company’s business partners or customers in connection with patent copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the company or its subcontractors the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited historically the company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively the company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to shipment of the instrument at december 31 2012 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of 121 million and 23 million respectively revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with multipleelement revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties 

  

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and is recognized as revenue 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2012 was 405 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 8 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2012 was recorded at its net realizable value of 230 million which is net of writedowns of 18 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

   

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 220 million 273 million and 317 million respectively as of december 31 2012 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units the waters division and ta division the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2012 the company’s warranty liability was 12 million 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standards which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but prohibit any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money at december 31 2012 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 64 million 39 million of which are classified as current liabilities and 25 million of which are classified as longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty 

with respect to the specific claims referenced in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to those claims as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial position 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 712 for its us benefit plans and 188 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2012 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2012 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 390 for the us benefit plans and 310 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standards for stockbased compensation require that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards the compensation expense that 

  

the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2012 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 recent accounting standard changes and developments 

information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen british pound and singapore dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

derivative transactions 

the company records its derivative transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establish the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities all derivatives whether designated in hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities if the derivative is designated as a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item 

  

affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in addition disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the company’s objectives for using derivative instruments the level of derivative activity the company engages in as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company’s financial position and performance 

the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risks the company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposures the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions in addition the company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts the company also assesses and documents both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances and shortterm assets and liabilities principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen british pound and singapore dollar the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 134 million 161 million and 136 million respectively 

the company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows in thousands 

 

 the following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign exchange contracts in thousands 

 

 assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012 would decrease pretax earnings by approximately 13 million 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily in bank deposits us and uk treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper investments with longer maturities are classified as shortterm investments and are held primarily in us treasury bills canadian government us dollardenominated treasury bills and commercial paper bank deposits 

  

and investmentgrade commercial paper the company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than us dollars as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 1489 million out of 1539 million and 1200 million out of 1281 million respectively of the company’s total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to us legal entities as of december 31 2012 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles 

the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of december 31 2012 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value

 item 1 business tableend general 

waters corporation “waters ® ” or the “company” is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs manufactures sells and services through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” and mass spectrometry “ms” technology systems and support products including chromatography columns other consumable products and comprehensive postwarranty service plans these systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together “lcms” and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments through its ta division “ta ® ” the company primarily designs manufactures sells and services thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments the company is also a developer and supplier of softwarebased products that interface with the company’s instruments as well as other manufacturers’ instruments 

the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial food environmental academic and government customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s lc and lcms instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full range of compounds these instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” food safety analysis and environmental testing the company’s thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals polymers and viscous liquids for uses in various industrial consumer goods and healthcare products as well as for life science research 

waters organized as a delaware corporation in 1991 is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary waters became a publiclytraded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of ta instruments in may 1996 and micromass limited “micromass ® ” in september 1997 

business segments 

the company’s business activities for which financial information is available are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers as a result of this evaluation the company determined that it has two operating segments waters division and ta division the company operates in the analytical instruments industry by designing manufacturing distributing and servicing instrument systems columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments the company’s two operating segments waters division and ta division have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes 

information concerning revenues and longlived assets attributable to each of the company’s products services and geographic areas is set forth in note 14 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

waters division 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and 

  

identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information while offering significant performance advantages acquity uplc is also compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2010 waters introduced the acquity uplc ® hclass instrument system which incorporates the performance of acquity uplc with the operational familiarity of traditional hplc systems the acquity uplc hclass is a streamlined system that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of quaternary solvent blending and a flowthrough needle injector to deliver the advanced performance expected of uplctype separations the acquity uplc hclass delivers high resolution sensitivity and improved throughput while maintaining the robustness and reliability for which the acquity systems are known in 2011 the company introduced the acquity uplc ® iclass instrument system the acquity uplc iclass provides a powerful solution to the most critical need by successfully analyzing compounds that are limited in amount or availability amid a complex matrix the acquity uplc iclass system maximizes peak capacity to enhance ms sensitivity it provides the lowest carryover complementing ms sensitivity and extending ms linear dynamic range and it has been purposefully engineered for the lowest dispersion during 2011 and 2010 the company experienced sales growth in the lc instrument system product line primarily from the sales of acquity uplc acquity uplc hclass and acquity uplc iclass systems 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

  

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument primarily uses acquity uplc columns in 2011 and 2010 the company experienced sales growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in acquity uplc columns 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and food safety testing products environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in addition the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc 

in february 2009 the company acquired thar instruments inc “thar” a global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction “sfc” systems 

mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry 

ms is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental and food safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and environmental market segments worldwide 

ms is an increasingly important detection technology for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo ® tq and xevo ® tqs instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® g2s are often used to analyze the role of proteins 

  

in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in late 2008 the xevo ® qtof tm ms an exact mass msms benchtop instrument was introduced in late 2009 the company introduced the synapt ® g2 hdms tm system the synapt g2 hdms and synapt ® g2 ms systems are high resolution exact mass msms platforms that are performanceenhanced replacements for the synapt hdms and synapt ms systems the performance enhancements offered by these new systems allow for higher resolution shape discrimination by the hdms version and superior mass resolution mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions in 2010 the company introduced the xevo ® tqs instrument system which is designed for the most demanding uplcmsms applications also in 2010 the company introduced the xevo ® g2 qtof tm instrument system the xevo g2 qtof is one of the most sensitive exact mass quantitative and qualitative benchtop msms instrument systems developed because it combines the integrated workflow benefits of engineered simplicity tm found in existing xevo qtof instrument systems with the ground breaking quantof tm technology of the synapt g2 instrument system in 2011 the company introduced the synapt ® g2s hdms instrument system the synapt g2s incorporates both highsensitivity waters stepwave tm ion transfer optics and triwave ® ion mobility technologies along with a suite of new informatics tools to take qualitative and quantitative high resolution performance to a new level 

lc and ms are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publiclydisclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc and lcms instrument systems chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc and lcms market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it may have a market share position in japan that ranks second to a domestic supplier

 item 1a risk factors 

the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following 

global economic conditions may decrease demand for the company’s products and harm our financial results 

the company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions these changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future there can be no assurance that the strong demand for the company’s products and services will continue in the future 

disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the company’s access to capital 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years including among other things sharp increases in the cost of new capital credit rating downgrades and bailouts severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money there can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

the company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand which may decrease for a number of reasons many beyond the company’s control 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital expenditures of the company’s customers changes in government regulations particularly effecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to academic and government institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurance that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of weakness in global economic conditions 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 52 of the company’s net sales in both 2011 and 2010 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the company’s which could result in decreased sales 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurance that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future 

the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us 

the company had approximately 991 million in debt and 1281 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 419 million from its existing credit facilities most of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs a majority of the company’s cash is generated from foreign operations with 12 billion of the company’s cash held by foreign subsidiaries the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through 1 cash from us operations 2 efficient and timely repatriation of cash from overseas 3 the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and 4 other sources obtained at an acceptable cost 

debt covenants and the company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the company’s capital and financial results 

the company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

disruption of operations at company manufacturing facilities could harm our financial condition 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and through a subcontractor in singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis products at its facilities in new castle delaware and pittsburgh pennsylvania rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

the company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political regulatory and economic changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

approximately 71 and 70 of the company’s net sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland and the united kingdom as well as significant subcontractors located in singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment in particular the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of european countries the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and associated adverse operational contractual and tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the loss of key members of management could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the key management employees have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s business would suffer if the company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have at a minimum a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s sales would deteriorate if the company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by wellestablished contract manufacturing firms in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could 

  

have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions which are unpredictable 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it does business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations 

the effects of climate change could harm the company’s business 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemical and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and wexford ireland severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunami could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resultant disruption of manufacturing operations could have a materially adverse impact to the financial results of the company 

compliance failures could harm the company’s business 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport the foreign corrupt practices act and environmental laws and regulations a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable government regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacture handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacture or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as those of the united states occupational health and safety administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and financial overview 

the company has two operating segments the waters division and the ta division “ta ® ” the waters division’s products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” mass spectrometry “ms” and chemistry consumable products and related services ta products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial food environmental academic and governmental customers these customers use the company’s products to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability of fine chemicals polymers and viscous liquids in consumer goods and healthcare products 

the company’s sales were 1851 million 1643 million and 1499 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively sales increased 13 in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 10 in 2010 as compared to 2009 in 2011 as compared with 2010 instrument system sales increased 14 while combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 11 these overall increases in 2011 sales were attributable to increased spending by the company’s pharmaceutical industrial and chemical analysis customers on new and existing lc ms and ta products the sales growth in 2011 is also attributable to an increase in demand for the recently launched acquity uplc ® hclass xevo ® qtof tm  xevo ® tqs and synapt ® g2s instrument systems sales growth of these new instrument systems was achieved in all major regions of the world the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 3 in 2011 the company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be slightly negative to 2012 sales when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates the 2010 increase in sales when compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher demand for the company’s products and services resulting from an improvement in global economic conditions introduction of new 

  

products and an increase in pharmaceutical and industrial spending on the company’s products foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in 2010 

waters division sales increased 12 in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 9 in 2010 as compared to 2009 the effect of foreign currency translation increased waters division sales by 3 in 2011 and had minimal impact on waters division sales in 2010 ta’s sales increased 16 in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 17 in 2010 as compared to 2009 the effect of foreign currency translation increased ta sales by 3 in 2011 and had minimal impact on ta sales in 2010 the july 2011 acquisition of anter corporation “anter” added 1 to ta’s sales in 2011 when compared to 2010 

geographically sales increased 16 in europe 13 in asia including japan 6 in the us and 26 in the rest of the world during 2011 as compared with 2010 the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in 2011 by 5 in europe 4 in asia and 1 in the rest of the world during 2010 as compared with 2009 sales increased 21 in asia and 9 in the us while sales were flat in europe and increased 13 in the rest of the world the effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2010 by 4 in europe and increased sales by 4 in asia and 3 in the rest of the world europe’s 2011 sales benefited from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers asia’s 2011 sales growth rate was not as high as the 2010 sales growth rate due to the impact of large regulatory pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in china in late 2010 and a slowdown in customer orders in india in late 2011 principally due to the devaluation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar the company does not expect the impact of the india rupee devaluation to have a longterm effect on sales 

in 2011 sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 13 and combined sales to industrial and environmental customers increased 15 as compared to 2010 these increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems chemistry consumables and services by the company’s customers and sales from the acquity uplc hclass xevo qtof xevo tqs and synapt g2s instrument systems in 2010 as compared to 2009 sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 12 and sales to industrial food safety and environmental customers increased 14 these increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems chemistry consumables and services by the company’s customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to the prior year combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5 higher in both 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010 as compared to 2009 these increases were primarily attributable to sales of newly introduced lc and lcms systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in asia in 2010 in 2012 as a result of the continuing austerity programs being put in place worldwide the company’s sales to governmental and academic customers may continue to lag behind the company’s overall anticipated sales growth rate 

operating income was 529 million 450 million and 395 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the overall increase in operating income in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in sales volumes and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation the overall increase in operating income in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily from increases in sales volumes with relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 26 million and 6 million of the increases in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009 respectively the company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be neutral or possibly decrease 2012 operating income when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates 

net income per diluted share was 469 406 and 334 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 net cash provided by operating activities was 497 million 458 million and 418 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the 39 million increase in operating cash flow in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily the result of higher net income and was also impacted in 2011 by the payment of amounts earned under the company’s 2010 management incentive plans the increase in operating cash flow in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily a result of higher net income lower incentive compensation payments made in 2010 as compared to 2009 and payments made in 2009 for a 6 million litigation payment and 6 million ta building lease termination 

within cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization were 85 million 63 million and 94 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively capital expenditures were higher in 2011 due to a 14 million land acquisition in the united kingdom where the company plans to construct a new facility that will consolidate certain existing primary ms research manufacturing and distribution locations the company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of 50 million to 70 million to construct this facility capital expenditures were higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new ta facility 

in january 2012 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of bahr thermoanalyse gmbh “bahr” a german manufacturer of a widerange of thermal analyzers for 12 million in cash the company acquired the net assets of anter for 11 million in cash in 2011 the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar instruments inc “thar” for 36 million in cash in 2009 the company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses product lines and technologies to augment the waters and ta operating divisions 

within cash flows used in financing activities the company received 60 million 101 million and 19 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option grants in february 2011 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period during 2011 2010 and 2009 the company repurchased 364 million 292 million and 210 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under the february 2011 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits 

in july 2011 waters entered into a new credit agreement the “2011 credit agreement” the 2011 credit agreement provides for a 700 million revolving facility and a 300 million term loan facility the term loan 

  

facility and the revolving facility both mature on july 28 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date in march 2011 the company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with a total face value of 200 million the company used the proceeds from the 2011 credit agreement and the issuances of senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes as a result of the issuances of senior unsecured notes the company’s weightedaverage interest rates have increased in 2011 due to higher rates paid on this fixedrate debt

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively the company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance and prior to shipment of the instrument at december 31 2011 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of 110 million and 25 million respectively revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the 

  

company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with multipleelement revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties 

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a whenandifavailable basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and is recognized as revenue 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2011 was 367 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 9 million 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2011 was recorded at its net realizable value of 213 million which is net of writedowns of 14 million 

  

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

 when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 192 million 237 million and 297 million respectively as of december 31 2011 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units the waters division and ta division the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2011 the company’s warranty liability was 13 million 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

  

the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money at december 31 2011 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 73 million 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to certain claims as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial position 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 720 for its us benefit plans and 250 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31 2011 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2011 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 433 for the us benefit plans and 329 for the nonus benefits plans 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standard for stockbased compensation requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this 

  

statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stockbased compensation accounting standard and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

as of december 31 2011 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument in 2010 waters introduced the acquity uplc ® hclass instrument system which incorporates the performance of acquity uplc with the operational familiarity of traditional hplc systems the acquity uplc hclass is a streamlined system that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of quaternary solvent blending and a flowthrough needle injector to deliver the advanced performance expected of uplctype separations the acquity uplc hclass delivers high resolution sensitivity and improved throughput while maintaining the robustness and reliability for which the acquity systems are known during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company experienced growth in the lc instrument system product line primarily from the sales of acquity uplc and acquity uplc hclass systems 

 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument systems and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument primarily uses acquity uplc columns in 2010 2009 and 

2008 the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in acquity uplc columns 

 

the company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and food safety testing products environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in addition the company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities these test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc 

 

in february 2009 the company acquired thar instruments inc “thar” a global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction “sfc” systems 

 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publiclydisclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

 

mass spectrometry 

 

ms is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental and food safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and environmental market segments worldwide 

 

the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole detector “sqd” and the tandem quadrupole detector “tqd” are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo ® tq and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt ® ms are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2008 the company introduced a new qtof instrument called the synapt ms this instrument is an improved version of the qtof premier tm that customers may opt to upgrade to synapt ® hdms tm capability in late 2008 the xevo ® qtof tm ms an exact mass msms benchtop instrument was introduced in late 2009 the company introduced the synapt ® g2 hdms tm system the synapt g2 hdms and synapt ® g2 ms systems are high resolution exact mass msms platforms that are performanceenhanced replacements for the synapt hdms and synapt ms systems the performance enhancements offered by these new systems allow for higher resolution shape discrimination by the hdms version and superior mass resolution mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions in 2010 the company introduced the xevo ® tqs instrument system which is designed for the most demanding uplcmsms applications also in 2010 the company introduced the xevo ® g2 qtof tm instrument system 

the xevo g2 qtof is one of the most sensitive exact mass quantitative and qualitative benchtop msms instrument system developed because it combines the integrated workflow benefits of engineered simplicity tm found in existing xevo qtof instrument systems with the ground breaking quantof technology of the synapt g2 instrument system 

 

lcms 

 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

 

waters division service 

 

the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument

protection of intellectual property 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

reliance on suppliers 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company the company believes alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

 

use of outside manufacturers 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors including the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components by a wellestablished contract manufacturing firm in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

risk of unexpected shifts in pretax income between tax jurisdictions 

the company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0 to in excess of 35 in various jurisdictions in which it does business in addition the company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including but not limited to changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the company’s income tax expense effective tax rate and results of operations in addition the company’s ireland statutory tax rate will increase to 125 in 2011 from the historical contractual tax rate of 10 and further increases are possible 

 

effects of climate change 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemical and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event 

that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes any such changes could have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 

 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and wexford ireland although the company believes it has an adequate disaster recovery plan in place severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunami could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries the effects of such damage and the resultant disruption of manufacturing operations could have a materially adverse impact to the financial results of the company

the company’s sales were 1643 million 1499 million and 1575 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively sales increased 10 in 2010 as compared to 2009 and sales decreased 5 in 2009 as compared to 2008 in 2010 as compared with 2009 instrument system sales increased 12 while combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 7 these increases in sales were primarily due to higher demand for the company’s products and services resulting from improvement in global economic conditions as compared to the prior year introduction of new products including the acquity uplc ® hclass synapt ® g2 and xevo ® qtof tm instrument systems and an increase in pharmaceutical and industrial spending on the company’s lc ms and ta products foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales in 2010 the 2009 decline in sales as compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower instrument spending by the company’s customers as a result of global economic recessionary conditions and to a lesser extent the effect of foreign currency translation 

 

waters division sales increased 9 in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 4 in 2009 as compared to 2008 foreign currency translation had minimal impact on waters division sales in 2010 and decreased sales by 2 in 2009 ta’s sales increased 17 in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 11 in 2009 as compared to 2008 foreign currency translation had minimal impact on ta’s sales in 2010 and 2009

in 2010 as compared to 2009 sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 12 and sales to industrial food safety and environmental customers increased 14 these increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems chemistry consumables and services by the company’s customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to the prior year combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5 higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 and were primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced lc and lcms systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in asia in 2009 as compared to 2008 sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 4 and sales to industrial and environmental customers decreased 11 these decreases were primarily a result of reduced spending on instrument systems caused by the global economic recession and to a lesser extent the strengthening of the us dollar in developing economies including india south america and eastern europe combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5 higher in 2009 and the increase was primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced ms instrument systems higher acquity uplc instrument system sales and global governmental stimulus spending programs 

 

operating income was 450 million 395 million and 390 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the overall increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily from the increases in sales volumes with relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages and benefits from lower spending earlier in 2010 foreign currency translation had minimal comparative impact on operating income the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was attributed to benefits of foreign currency translation and sales mix combined with lower spending these increases were partially offset by the impact of 6 million of expense in connection with the ta building lease termination payment and 3 million of severance costs related to a restructuring in europe 

 

net income per diluted share was 406 334 and 321 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2010 2009 and 2008

within cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures related to property plant equipment and software capitalization were 63 million 94 million and 69 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures were higher in 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new ta facility which was completed in june 2009 in 2010 the company entered into an agreement subject to local regulatory approval to purchase land in the united kingdom to construct a new facility which will consolidate certain existing primary manufacturing locations the company spent 3 million in 2010 in relation to this new facility and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of 70 million to 90 million to construct this facility 

 

the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar instruments inc “thar” for 36 million in cash in february 2009 the company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses product lines and technologies to augment the waters and ta operating divisions 

 

within cash flows used in financing activities the company received 101 million 19 million and 29 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributed to changes in the company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option grants in february 2009 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company repurchased 292 million 210 million and 235 million of the company’s outstanding common stock respectively under the february 2009 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs in february 2011 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 500 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels as well as to invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits

originally recorded in 2008 related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities the recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the us treasury in february 2009 the tax benefit in 2009 decreased the company’s effective tax rate by 12 percentage points in 2009 the onetime tax provision in 2008 increased the company’s effective tax rate by 14 percentage points in 2008 in addition the effective tax rate for 2008 included a 16 million benefit resulting from outofperiod adjustments related to software capitalization amortization the outofperiod adjustments had the effect of reducing the company’s effective tax rate by 40 percentage points in 2008 the remaining difference between the effective tax rates for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to differences in pretax income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates

financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices the company recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer the company structures its sales arrangements as fob shipping point or international equivalent and accordingly recognizes revenue upon shipment in some cases fob destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site 

 

the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with multiple element revenue recognition accounting standards with respect to the installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties 

 

instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition the company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable collection is probable and there are no significant postdelivery obligations remaining the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when and if available basis the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element maintenance is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element software license and is recognized as revenue 

 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may 

result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2010 was 358 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 6 million

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 181 million 215 million and 292 million respectively as of december 31 2010 

 

the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year for goodwill impairment review purposes the company has two reporting units the waters division and ta the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2010 the company’s warranty liability was 11 million 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

 

the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money at december 31 2010 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 72 million 

 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in item 3 as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial position 

 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 686 for its us benefit plans and 307 for its nonus benefit plans 

 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2010 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2010 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 531 for the us benefit plans and 363 for the nonus benefits plans 

 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standard for stockbased compensation requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stockbased compensation accounting standard and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

 

as of december 31 2010 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

recent accounting standard changes and developments 

 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in june 2009 a new accounting standard was issued relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities this statement addresses 1 the effects on certain provisions of existing accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the qualifying specialpurpose entity concept and 2 constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of existing accounting standards including those in which the accounting and disclosures under existing accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity this standard is effective for periods beginning after november 15 2009 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in january 2010 the company adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fairvalue measurements this standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level 2 and level 3 measurements as this newly issued accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure the adoption of this standard did not impact the company’s financial position or results of operations in addition effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 this standard will require additional disclosure and require an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in level 3 fairvalue measurements on a gross basis rather than as one net amount 

recently issued accounting standards 

in october 2009 a new accounting consensus was issued for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item previously the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor under the existing accounting consensus if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

also in october 2009 a new accounting consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software this consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts who mandate testing requiring hplc instrumentation 

 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc in the third quarter of 2004 during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company experienced growth in the lc instrument system product line primarily from the sales of acquity uplc systems 

 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument primarily uses acquity uplc columns in 2009 2008 and 2007 excluding the small impact from acquisitions mentioned below the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in acquity uplc columns 

 

in february 2009 the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar instruments inc “thar” a privatelyheld global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction “sfc” systems for 36 million in cash including the assumption of 4 million of debt in december 2008 the company acquired the net assets of analytical products group inc “apg” a provider of environmental testing products for quality control and proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories for 5 million in cash the apg business has been integrated 

into the company’s environmental resources associates inc “era” business which was acquired in december 2006 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of era a provider of environmental testing products for quality control proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories for 62 million in cash including the assumption of 4 million of debt era also provides product support services required to help laboratories with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in february 2006 the company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of vicam ® limited partnership “vicam” for 14 million in cash vicam is a leading provider of tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities the company’s test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc the apg era and vicam acquisitions are part of the chemistry consumable product line 

 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

 

mass spectrometry 

 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap timeofflight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental and food safety testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical food and environmental market segments worldwide 

 

the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the sqd and the tqd are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc system upgrade larger quadrupole systems such as the xevo tm tq and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing and quadrupole timeofflight “qtof tm ” instruments such as the company’s synapt tm ms are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2006 the company introduced the tandem quadrupole device the tqd and a new hybrid qtof technology system the synapt tm hdms tm  the synapt hdms system integrates ion mobility technology within a qtof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows researchers to glean molecular shape information a novel capability for a mass spectrometry instrument in 2008 the company introduced a new qtof instrument called the synapt ms this instrument is an improved version of the qtof premier tm that customers may opt to upgrade to synapt hdms capability in late 2008 the xevo tm qtof tm ms an exact mass msms benchtop instrument was introduced in late 2009 the company introduced the synapt tm g2 hdms tm system the synapt g2 hdms and synapt tm g2 ms systems are high resolution exact mass msms platforms that are performance enhanced replacements for the synapt hdms and synapt ms systems the performance enhancements offered by these new systems allow for higher resolution shape discrimination by the hdms version and superior mass resolution mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions 

lcms 

 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

 

waters division service 

 

the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry including but not limited to the following risks 

 

global economic conditions 

the global economic conditions had an unfavorable impact on demand for the company’s products in 2009 and in late 2008 these conditions resulted in a decline in demand for the company’s products and services and may result in a decline in demand for the company’s products and services in the near future there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies any further deterioration or prolonged disruption in the financial markets or market conditions generally may result in reduced demand for the company’s products and services the company’s global business may also be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity as a result of the economic and financial market situations 

 

financial market conditions 

financial markets in the us europe and asia have experienced extreme disruption over the past few years including among other things a sharp increase in the cost of new capital severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions resulting in large asset writedowns higher costs of capital rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money while currently these conditions have not impacted the company’s ability to access its existing cash or borrow on its existing revolving credit facility there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions any further deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the company participates may impair the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and impair its ability to access sources of new capital the company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur 

 

customer demand 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc ms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry products the timing and level of capital expenditures of the company’s customers changes in government regulations particularly effecting drug food and drinking water testing funding available to academic and government institutions general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations the company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end there can be no assurances that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of weakness in global economic conditions 

 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 51 and 50 of the company’s net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

competition and the analytical instrument market 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc ms lcms thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry product lines is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurances that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurances that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future 

 

levels of debt and debt service requirements 

the company had approximately 632 million in debt and 630 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 the company also had the ability to borrow an additional 479 million from its existing credit facilities most of the company’s debt is in the us there is a substantial cash requirement in the us to fund operations and capital expenditures service debt interest obligations finance potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs a majority of the company’s cash is maintained and generated from foreign operations the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the us to address these requirements through cash from us operations efficient and timely repatriation of cash from overseas the company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and other sources obtained at an acceptable cost 

 

debt covenants 

the company’s debt may become subject to restrictive covenants that limit the company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the company these debt covenants include restrictions on the company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the company’s ability to make dividend or other payments secure other indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the company’s assets the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the company’s debt agreements the company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the company’s future performance which is subject to but not limited to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond the company’s control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

 

risk of disruption of operations 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and singapore chemistry separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis products at its facility in new castle delaware rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and crawley england and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the company’s recent acquisitions any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

sovereign risk foreign operations and exchange rates 

approximately 69 and 70 of the company’s net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company has considerable manufacturing operations in ireland the united kingdom and singapore as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

reliance on key management 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the key management employees have an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

protection of intellectual property 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurances that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by thirdparty patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

reliance on suppliers 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company the company believes alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

 

use of outside manufacturers 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors since 2006 the company has transitioned the manufacturing of lc instrument systems and related components to a wellestablished contract manufacturing firm in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

risk in unexpected shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions 

the company is subject to a range of income tax rates from 0 to in excess of 35 depending on specific tax jurisdictions around the world the company typically generates a substantial portion of its taxable income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year shifts in actual taxable income from previous quarters’ projections due to factors including but not limited to changes in volume and foreign currency translation rates could have a notable favorable or unfavorable effect on the company’s income tax expense and results of operations 

 

effects of climate change 

the company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemical and other substances that are regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use andor levels of possible emissions from such chemicals andor other substances the company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to 

its manufacturing processes there can be no assurance that any such changes would not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 

 

another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions the company manufactures a growing percentage of its hplc uplc and ms products in both singapore and wexford ireland although the company believes its has an adequate disaster recovery plan in place severe weather conditions including earthquakes hurricanes andor tsunami could potentially cause significant damage to the company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries there can be no assurance that the effects of such damage and the resultant disruption of manufacturing operations would not have a materially adverse impact to the financial results of the company 

 

regulatory compliance 

the company is subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including among others health and safety importexport and environmental a portion of the company’s operations are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign agencies these regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities including design development labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution any failure by the company to comply with applicable government regulations could result in product recalls the imposition of fines restrictions on the company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations 

 

some of the company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacture handling use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances this requires the company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations if the company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacture or distribution of its products it could face civil andor criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant 

 

some of the company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization the company must comply with these rules as well as those of other agencies such as those of the united states occupational health and safety administration failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification andor the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

business and financial overview 

 

the company’s sales were 1499 million 1575 million and 1473 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively sales declined 5 in 2009 as compared with 2008 and sales grew by 7 in 2008 as compared with 2007 overall 

the 2009 decline in sales is primarily due to lower instrument spending by the company’s customers as a result of global economic recessionary conditions and to a lesser extent due to the effect of foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 2 in 2009 companies acquired in late 2008 and early 2009 added 2 to sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 2009 instrument system sales declined 10 while recurring sales of chemistry consumables and service increased 2 as compared with 2008 primarily from the effect of acquisitions the 2008 sales growth as compared to 2007 was primarily attributed to the company’s introduction of new products the increase in chemistry consumable and service sales and the effects of foreign currency translation 

 

a decline in sales as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year started in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic recession and continued into the first three quarters of 2009 this decline ended in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales increased at a rate of 3 over the 2008 fourth quarter the increase in the 2009 fourth quarter sales is attributed to favorable currency translation the benefit from acquisitions a slight improvement in global economic conditions and the introduction of new products 

 

during 2009 as compared to 2008 sales increased 1 in asia including japan while sales decreased 4 in the us 9 in europe and 12 in the rest of the world the effect of currency translation decreased 2009 sales by 2 during 2008 as compared to 2007 sales increased 1 in the us 7 in europe 16 in asia and 3 in the rest of the world the effect of currency translation benefited 2008 sales by approximately 2 

 

in 2009 as compared to 2008 sales to pharmaceutical and industrial and food safety customers decreased 4 and 11 respectively these decreases are primarily a result of reduced spending on instrument systems caused by the global economic recession and to a lesser extent the strengthening of the us dollar in developing economies including india south america and eastern europe global sales to government and academic customers were 5 higher in 2009 and the increase can be primarily attributed to sales of the newly introduced mass spectrometry instrument systems higher acquity uplc ® instrument system sales and global governmental stimulus spending programs in 2008 as compared to 2007 global sales to pharmaceutical industrial and food safety and government and academic customers grew 3 13 and 10 respectively the increases were primarily attributable to the demand for the company’s new products in the us and asia new governmental regulatory testing requirements higher awareness of food safety issues and higher chemistry consumable and service sales 

 

the waters division’s products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc ® ” and together with hplc referred to as “lc” mass spectrometry “ms” and chemistry consumable products and related services the waters division sales decline of 4 in 2009 as compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to weaker demand for instrument systems due to the reduction in capital spending by the company’s customers as a result of the global recession the waters division’s recurring revenue growth from chemistry consumables and service was 2 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily from the effect of acquisitions the waters division sales grew by 7 in 2008 as compared with 2007 the waters division sales growth in 2008 was strongly influenced by acquity uplc sales shipments of new synapt tm hdms tm  xevo tm tq and synapt tm ms systems and recurring revenue growth from the service and chemistry consumables business 

 

in february 2009 the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar instruments inc “thar” a privatelyheld global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction “sfc” systems for 36 million in cash including the assumption of 4 million of debt the company had previously made a 4 million equity investment in thar in june 2007 thar added approximately 17 million of product sales and was about neutral to earnings in 2009 after debt service costs recently acquired companies both thar and the 2008 acquisition of analytical products group inc “apg” added 2 to waters division’s sales in 2009 

 

the ta division’s “ta ® ” products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales sales for ta decreased by 11 in 2009 as compared to 2008 ta’s sales decline in 2009 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in spending by the company’s industrial customers as a result of the global economic recession the july 2008 acquisition of vti corporation “vti” added 1 to ta’s sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 ta’s 2008 sales growth of 10 as compared to 2007 can be primarily attributed to new product introductions the effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions acquisitions 

and the effect of foreign currency translation added 3 and 2 respectively to ta’s 2008 sales as compared to 2007

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with accounting standards 

for revenue recognition accordingly revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified with respect to installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort 

 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition software revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant postdelivery obligations remain software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2009 was 314 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 7 million 

 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2009 was 179 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 13 million 

 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset longlived asset or goodwill including its eventual residual value is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset the asset is writtendown to its estimated fair value net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 182 million 211 million and 293 million respectively as of december 31 2009 the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill the company performed its annual review during the fourth quarter of 2009 and currently 

does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2009 the company’s warranty liability was 10 million 

 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

 

the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money at december 31 2009 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 78 million 

 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in item 3 as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 795 for its us benefit plans and 334 for its nonus benefit plans 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2009 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2009 the company determined the weightedaverage discount rate to be 595 for the us benefit plans and 405 for the nonus benefits plans 

 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

 

stockbased compensation 

the accounting standard for stockbased compensation requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stockbased compensation accounting standard and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

 

as of december 31 2009 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

recent accounting standards changes 

 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in june 2009 a new accounting standard was issued that establishes the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” that are to be used as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” for nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states this standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september 15 2009 the adoption of this standard by the company did not have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2009 a new accounting standard was issued for measuring liabilities at fair value this standard provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods 1 a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets andor 2 a valuation technique that is consistent with gaap this standard also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in april 2009 a new accounting standard was issued to provide greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an otherthantemporary impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an otherthantemporary impairment event has occurred this standard applies to debt securities this standard was effective for periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in april 2009 a new accounting standard was issued to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements this standard was effective for periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in the second quarter of 2009 the company implemented the newly issued subsequent events accounting standard this standard establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued the adoption of this standard did not impact the company’s financial position or results of operations the company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after december 31 2009 up through february 26 2010 the date the company issued these financial statements during this period the company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events which have not been disclosed 

 

in december 2008 a new accounting standard was issued relating to the employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets this requirement amends the previous accounting standard to provide guidance on employers’ disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan this new standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 the provisions of this new standard are not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

recently issued accounting standards

in october 2009 a new accounting consensus was issued for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item previously the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor under the existing accounting consensus if the fair value of all of the 

elements in the arrangement was not determinable then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in october 2009 a new accounting consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software this consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen british pound and singapore dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

 

hedge transactions 

the company records its hedge transactions in accordance the accounting standard for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities all derivatives whether designated in hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities if the derivative is designated as a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in addition disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the company’s objectives for using derivative instruments the level of derivative activity the company engages in as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company’s financial position and performance

balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions in addition the company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts the company also assesses and documents both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 

 

cash flow hedges 

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt in august 2007 the company entered into two floatingtofixedrate interest rate swaps each with a notional amount of 50 million and maturity dates of april 2009 and october 2009 to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt at december 31 2009 the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at both december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had a 2 million liability in other current liabilities in the consolidated balances sheets related to the interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2009 the company recorded a change of 2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on these interest rate swap agreements for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax unrealized loss of 1 million and 2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income respectively on these interest rate swap agreements for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the company recorded additional interest expense of 2 million 1 million and less than 1 million respectively 

 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 33 of its sales denominated in euros 11 in japanese yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2009 as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

 

in 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of application beyond that of hplc enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc in the third quarter of 2004 during 2008 2007 and 2006 the company experienced growth in the lc instrument systems product line primarily from the sales of the acquity uplc 

 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument will primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2008 2007 and 2006 excluding the small impact from acquisitions mentioned below the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in acquity uplc columns 

 

in december 2008 the company acquired the net assets of analytical products group inc “apg” a provider of environmental testing products for quality control and proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories for 5 million in cash the apg business has been integrated into the company’s environmental resources associates inc “era” business which was acquired in december 2006 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of era a provider of environmental testing products for quality control proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories for 62 million in cash including the 

assumption of 4 million of debt era also provides product support services required to help laboratories with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis in february 2006 the company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of vicam limited partnership “vicam” for 14 million in cash vicam is a leading provider of tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities the company’s test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc the apg era and vicam acquisitions have all been integrated into the chromatography column product line 

 

in june 2007 the company made an equity investment in thar instruments inc “thar” a privately held global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction systems for 4 million in cash this investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting on february 2 2009 the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar for 36 million including the assumption of 4 million of debt 

 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

 

mass spectrometry 

 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental market segments worldwide 

 

the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the sqd and the tqd are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc upgrade large quadrupole systems such as the xevo tm tq and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof tm instruments such as the company’s synapt tm ms are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in late 2006 the company introduced a new tandem quadrupole device the tqd and a new hybrid quadrupoletime of flight technology system the synapt tm hdms tm  the synapt hdms system integrates ion mobility technology within a qtof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows researchers to glean molecular shape information a novel capability for a mass spectrometry instrument in 2008 the company introduced a new qtof instrument called the synapt ms this instrument is an improved version of the qtof premier tm that customers may opt to upgrade to synapt hdms capability in late 2008 the xevo quadrupole timeofflight qtof mass spectrometer ms an exact mass msms benchtop instrument was introduced the introduction of these new products has augmented the growth of the ms instrument systems 

lcms 

 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and be operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

 

service 

 

the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument

quarter of 2008 decreased from the fourth quarter of 2007 by 4 from the effects of foreign currency translation the company expects this effect of foreign currency trend to continue into 2009 

 

during 2008 and 2007 us sales increased 1 and 17 european sales increased 7 and 17 asian sales including japan increased 16 and 12 and sales in the rest of the world increased 3 and 11 respectively the effect of currency translation benefited the 2008 and 2007 sales growth rate by 2 and by 3 respectively both increases principally resulting from european sales 

 

in 2008 and 2007 global sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 3 and 13 respectively global sales to government and academic customers were 10 higher in 2008 and 24 higher in 2007 over the prior year respectively and can be primarily attributed to demand for the company’s new products in the us and asia global sales to industrial and food safety customers grew 13 in 2008 and 16 in 2007 primarily as a result of new governmental regulatory testing requirements higher awareness of food safety issues higher chemistry consumable and service sales the benefit from acquisitions and demand for the company’s new products 

 

the waters division sales grew by 7 in 2008 and 14 in 2007 the waters division’s products and services consist of high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography ® “uplc” and together with hplc herein referred to as “lc” mass spectrometry “ms” and chemistry consumable products and related services the waters division sales growth was strongly influenced by acquity uplc ® sales shipments of new synapt tm hdms tm  xevo tm tq and synapt ms systems and recurring sales growth from the service and chemistry consumables business 

 

in december 2008 the company acquired the net assets of analytical products group inc “apg” a provider of environmental testing products for quality control and proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories for 5 million in cash apg’s product sales in 2009 are expected to be approximately 4 million in june 2007 the company made an equity investment in thar instruments inc “thar” a privately held global leader in the design development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction systems for 4 million in cash on february 2 2009 the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of thar for 36 million including the assumption of 4 million of debt the company expects that thar will add approximately 20 million of product sales and be about neutral to earnings in 2009 after debt service costs 

 

sales growth for the ta division “ta” grew 10 and 25 for 2008 and 2007 respectively ta’s products and services consist of thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales ta’s sales growth can be primarily attributed to new product introductions the effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions the effect of foreign currency translation benefited sales by 2 in 2008 and 3 in 2007 the july 2008 acquisition of vti corporation “vti” and the august 2007 acquisition of calorimetry sciences corporation “csc” added 3 to ta’s sales growth in 2008 ta sales growth for 2007 also benefited from a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007 as well as the benefit of the csc acquisition and the 2006 acquisition of thermometric ab which added 4 to ta’s sales growth 

 

operating income was 390 million 349 million and 295 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 41 million net increase in operating income in 2008 over 2007 is primarily a result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of a onetime 12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the contribution into the waters employee investment plan a 401k defined contribution plan for us employees this 2008 increase was partially offset by a patent litigation provision of 7 million and the 9 million impact of an outofperiod capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during the three months ended june 28 2008 the 54 million net increase in operating income in 2007 over 2006 is primarily a result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume and the impact of 8 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2006 relating to the february 2006 cost reduction initiative being offset by the 12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the transitional contribution into the waters employee investment plan 

 

net income per diluted share was 321 262 and 213 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively net income per diluted share grew at a rate of 23 in both 2008 over 2007 and 2007 over 2006 respectively 

 

during the second quarter of 2008 the company identified errors originating in periods prior to the three months ended june 28 2008 the errors primarily related to i an overstatement of the company’s income tax 

expense of 16 million as a result of errors in recording its income tax provision during the period from 2000 to march 29 2008 and ii an understatement of amortization expense of 9 million for certain capitalized software the company incorrectly calculated its provision for income taxes by taxeffecting its tax liability utilizing a us tax rate of 35 instead of an irish tax rate of 10 in addition the company incorrectly accounted for irishbased capitalized software and the related amortization expense as us dollardenominated instead of eurodenominated resulting in an understatement of amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment the outofperiod adjustment increased the 2008 net income per diluted share by 008 

 

in addition the company recorded a onetime 5 million tax provision in the third quarter of 2008 associated with the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities in october 2008 this 5 million tax provision decreased net income per diluted share by 005 in 2008 these entities were effectively liquidated into the us to better align the company’s legal entity structure with its current business objectives the majority of this legal entity reorganization qualifies as a taxfree liquidation and it resulted in the company being able to utilize 572 million of cash and shortterm investments domestically in february 2009 the us treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations that eliminate concerns with respect to the 5 million unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the third quarter of 2008 through the company’s tax provision because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated during the first quarter of 2009 the company will record this 5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and therefore as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2009 

 

in october 2008 the company utilized the cash from the reorganization described above to voluntarily prepay the 150 million term loan under the credit agreement entered into in march 2008 the “2008 credit agreement” there was no penalty for prepaying the term loan and the repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008 credit agreement in addition the company utilized these cash balances to voluntarily repay 340 million of revolving outstanding debt under the credit agreement entered into in january 2007 the “2007 credit agreement” the company prepaid debt in order to reduce the company’s exposure to leverage and interest rate risk in the currently volatile capital and investment markets 

 

the company also recorded a 7 million provision in 2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a judgment issued against the company relating to an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with agilent technologies inc this litigation provision decreased net income per diluted share by 004 in 2008 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 418 million 371 million and 264 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 47 million increase in operating cash flow in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily the result of higher net income and improved cash collections from customers partially offset by a 13 million onetime transition benefit payment into the waters employee investment plan that was expensed in 2007 increases in inventory and the timing of payments to vendors the 107 million increase in operating cash flow in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily the result of higher net income the leveling off of an inventory rampup in 2006 for new product introductions and an increase in safety stock related to the outsourcing to singapore and the timing of payments to vendors in addition the 2006 operating cash flow included a 9 million tax payment associated with the american jobs creation act “ajca” 7 million of severance and other facilityrelated payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a 4 million litigation payment

within cash flows used in financing activities the company received 29 million 91 million and 40 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively fluctuations in these amounts are primarily attributed to the change in the company stock price and the expiration of stock option grants in february 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period during 2008 2007 and 2006 the company repurchased 41 million 34 million and 58 million shares at a cost of 235 million 201 million and 249 million under the february 2007 authorization 

and previously announced stock repurchase programs in february 2009 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 500 million of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels and invest in research technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin “sab” 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” accordingly revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified with respect to installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multipleelement arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort 

 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition 

with respect to certain transactions” software revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant postdelivery obligations remain software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2008 was 292 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 8 million

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company’s current business model net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 150 million 172 million and 268 million respectively as of december 31 2008 the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill the company performed its annual review during the fourth quarter of 2008 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

 

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company adopted fin 48 as of january 1 2007 fin 48 requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 were 77 million 

 

litigation 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in item 3 as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 800 for its waters retirement plan which is the majority of the company’s benefit obligation and expense 

 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2008 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2008 the company determined this rate to be 638 for the waters retirement plan which is the majority of the company’s 2008 benefit obligation and 2009 expense retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company’s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the 

assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than 1 million 

 

stockbased compensation 

the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 this standard requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas no 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas no 123r and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

 

as of december 31 2008 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

recent accounting standards changes 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings the company did not elect to remeasure any of its existing financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of this standard 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” which replaces sfas no 141 this revised standard requires assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests acquired to be measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the business combination in addition this statement expands the scope to include all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more businesses this statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 

 

sfas no 141r will be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after january 1 2009 adoption is not expected to materially impact the company’s consolidated financial position or 

results of operations directly when it becomes effective as the only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at that time relates to disposition of uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions following adoption the resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings rather than through goodwill adoption of this statement is however expected to have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions subsequent to january 1 2009 are reflected in the financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates the company 

attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines 

 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen and british pound the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

 

hedge transactions 

 

the company records its hedge transactions in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities all derivatives whether designated in hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities if the derivative is designated as a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 

 

the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks the company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fairvalue cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions the company also assesses and documents both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 

 

cash flow hedges 

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt in august 2007 the company entered into two floatingtofixedrate interest rate swaps each with a notional amount of 50 million and maturity dates of april 2009 and october 2009 to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax unrealized loss of 2 million and 1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income respectively on these interest rate swap agreements 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company entered into a floatingtofixedrate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200 million and maturity date of june 2007 to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax realized gain of 1 million and in december 2006 the company closed out the swap resulting in a pretax gain of less than 1 million the gain was deferred and was recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate swap 

 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 35 of its sales denominated in euros 10 in japanese yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2008 as a 

result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 

 

during 2007 and 2006 the company hedged its net investment in euro foreign affiliates with crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from 30 million to 100 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had no outstanding crosscurrency interest rate swaps contracts for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 10 million at december 31 2006 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts totaled 100 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 11 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 10 million and unrealized losses of 1 million 

 

other 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies primarily include the euro japanese yen british pound and singapore dollar the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 120 million 101 million and 71 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 23 million which consists of realized losses of 22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 2 million which consists of realized gains of 3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 4 million which consists of realized gains of 3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 1 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts 

 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2008 would decrease earnings by approximately 12 million 

 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally 90 days or less in commercial paper rated a1 or a1 by standard  poors and p1 by moody’s investors service bank deposits repurchase agreements us government treasury bills and aaa rated us treasury bill and european government bond money market funds similar investments with longer maturities are classified as shortterm investments cash equivalents and shortterm investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value the company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than us dollars as of december 31 2008 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles collateralized debt obligation conduits or assetbacked conduits 

 

the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of december 31 2008 the carrying value of the company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to 

analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies such as the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts that mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

 

in march 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of application beyond that of hplc enabling the uncovering of new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc in the third quarter of 2004 during 2007 2006 and 2005 the company experienced growth in the instrument systems product line primarily from the sales of the acquity uplc 

 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated alliance ® 2795 systems for high speed screening and that have a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded and competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument will primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2007 2006 and 2005 excluding the small impact from acquisitions mentioned below the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in the xbridge tm  sunfire tm and acquity uplc columns as well as in oasis ® sample preparation cartridges 

 

in february 2006 the company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of vicam limited partnership “vicam” for 138 million in cash vicam is a leading provider of tests to identify and quantify 

mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities the company’s test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer lcms or hplc in december 2006 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of environmental resources associates inc “era” a provider of environmental testing products for quality control proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories for 618 million in cash and the assumption of 38 million of debt era also provides product support services required to help laboratories with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis 

 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

 

mass spectrometry 

 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

 

currently the company offers a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof ion mobility and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental market segments worldwide 

 

the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smallersized mass spectrometers such as the sqd and the tqd are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc upgrade large quadrupole systems such as the waters quattro micro tm and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for latestage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof instruments such as the company’s qtof micro tm and qtof premier tm instruments are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in late 2006 the company also introduced a new tandem quadrupole device the tqd and a new hybrid quadrupoletime of flight technology system the synapt tm hdms tm  the synapt hdms system integrates ion mobility technology within a qtof tm geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows researchers to glean molecular shape information a novel capability for a mass spectrometry instrument the introduction of these new products has augmented the recent growth of the ms instrument systems 

 

lcms 

 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and be operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid 

instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and service integrated lcms systems 

 

service 

 

the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a multiyear contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument

reliance on outside manufacturers 

certain components or modules of the company’s lc and ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors in april 2006 the company transitioned the manufacturing of the alliance hplc instrument system to a company in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods in addition the company adopted fin 48 as of january 1 2007 fin 48 requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 were 685 million 

 

litigation 

as described in item 3 of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in item 3 as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 800 for its waters retirement plan which is the majority of the company’s benefit obligation and expense 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2007 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2007 the company determined this rate to be 640 for the waters retirement plan which is the majority of the company’s 2007 benefit obligation and 2008 expense retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company’s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by approximately 03 million a onequarter percentage point increase in the assumed longterm rate of return would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by approximately 02 million 

 

stockbased compensation 

the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 this standard requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fairvalue recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas no 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas no 123r and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs associated with awards for 2007 and 2006 now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

 

the aftertax stockbased compensation and the impact to diluted earnings per share of adopting sfas no 123r for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 were 200 million with a 019 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share and 206 million with a 020 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share respectively as of december 31 2007 the company has capitalized stockbased compensation costs of 04 million and 16 million to inventory and capitalized software respectively in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 the company has capitalized stockbased compensation costs of 06 million and 10 million to inventory and capitalized software respectively in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations including fasb interpretation “fin” no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation” for its plans under this accounting method stock option compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at the current fair value of the company’s common stock as of the date of the award generally did not require compensation expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations stockbased compensation expense recognized for the company’s fixed employee stock option plans restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan was 08 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

as of december 31 2007 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

recent accounting standards changes 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this interpretation prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure report present and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take the interpretation requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money in addition the interpretation mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax reporting positions the interpretation is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the company’s financial position see note 9 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the impact of adopting this pronouncement 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this standard addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fairvalue measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap this standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 relative to sfas no 157 the fasb proposed fasb staff positions “fsp” 157a 157b and 157c fsp 157a amends sfas no 157 to exclude sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions while fsp 157b delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis fsp 157c clarifies the principles in sfas no 157 on the fair value measurement of liabilities the company is in the process of evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings the company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” which replaces sfas no 141 this revised standard requires assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests acquired to be measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the business combination in addition this statement expands the scope to include all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more businesses this statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 the company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines 

 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen and british pound the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

 

cash flow hedges 

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt in august 2007 the company entered into two floatingtofixedrate interest rate swaps each with a notional amount of 500 million and maturity dates of april 2009 and october 2009 to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax unrealized loss of 13 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company entered into a floatingtofixedrate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 2000 million and maturity date of june 2007 to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax realized gain of 05 million and in december 2006 the company closed out the swap resulting in a pretax gain of 04 million the gain was deferred and has been recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate swap for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax unrealized loss of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement 

 

during the first quarter of 2004 the company entered into a floatingtofixedrate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 1250 million and maturity date of 21 months to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt the company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 and 09 million of the total 16 million realized gain was recognized in earnings in 2005 through the original term of the interest rate swap 

 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in interest rates the fair market value of the floatingtofixedrate interest rate swap would decrease by approximately 13 million 

 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 35 of its sales denominated in euros 9 in japanese yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2007 as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in 

foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 

 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 the company hedged its net investment in euro foreign affiliates with crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from 300 million to 1000 million at december 31 2007 the company had no outstanding crosscurrency interest rate swaps contracts for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 100 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 100 million at december 31 2006 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts totaled 1000 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 110 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 97 million and unrealized losses of 13 million at december 31 2005 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts totaled 500 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 07 million relating to closed euro crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

 

during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in japanese yen foreign affiliates with japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from 260 million to 370 million at december 31 2005 the company had no outstanding japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax realized losses of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

 

during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in british pounds ranging from £250 million to £750 million under the terms of the agreements the company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell british pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy british pounds with option premiums that offset at december 31 2005 the company had outstanding range forward agreements in british pounds with notional amounts totaling £300 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 61 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 58 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of 03 million related to the open british pound range forward agreements 

 

during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds at december 31 2005 the company had no forward exchange contracts in british pounds used to hedge its net investment position for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a realized gain of 16 million 

 

other 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen and british pound the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 1014 million 709 million and 729 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 24 million which consists of realized gains of 32 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 08 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 39 million which consists of realized gains of 25 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 14 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2005 the 

company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 05 million which consists of realized gains of 15 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 10 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts 

 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2007 would decrease earnings by approximately 101 million 

 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally 90 days or less in commercial paper rated a1 or a1 by standard  poors and p1 by moody’s investors service bank deposits repurchase agreements us government agency debt and aaa rated money market funds similar investments with longer maturities are classified as shortterm investments cash equivalents and shortterm investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value the company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than us dollars as of december 31 2007 the company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles collateralized debt obligation conduits or assetbacked conduits 

 

the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments as of december 31 2007 the carrying value of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments approximated fair value

general 

 

waters corporation “waters” or the “company” an analytical instrument manufacturer designs manufactures sells and services through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc” and together with hplc herein referred to as “lc” and mass spectrometry “ms” instrument systems and support products including chromatography columns other consumable products and comprehensive postwarranty service plans these systems are complementary products that can be integrated together and used along with other analytical instruments through its ta division “ta” the company designs manufactures sells and services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments which are used primarily in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial consumer goods and health care products the company is also a developer and supplier of software based products that interface with the company’s instruments as well as other instrument manufacturers’ instruments 

 

the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial academic and government customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s lc and ms instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full range of compounds these instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” food safety analyses and environmental testing the company’s thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals and polymers for uses in various industrial consumer goods and health care products 

 

the company typically experiences a seasonal increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar yearend 

 

waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary waters became a publicly traded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of ta instruments in may 1996 and micromass limited “micromass” in september 1997 

 

business segments 

 

the company’s business activities for which discrete financial information is available are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief executive officer as a result of this evaluation the company determined that it has two operating segments waters division and ta division as indicated above the company operates in the analytical instruments industry manufacturing distributing and servicing products in three complementary technologies lc and ms instruments columns and other consumables and thermal analysis and rheometry instruments the company’s two operating segments waters division and ta have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes 

 

information concerning revenues and longlived assets attributable to each of the company’s geographic areas is set forth in note 17 of notes to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

waters division 

 

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to 

analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

 

the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs to develop manufacturing methods and to assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies and in many instances the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts who mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

 

traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

 

in march 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company described as ultraperformance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc ®  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of application beyond that of hplc enabling the uncovering of new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc in the third quarter of 2004 during 2006 and 2005 the company experienced growth in the instrument systems product line primarily from the sales of the acquity uplc 

 

the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

 

waters hplc columns can be used on watersbranded as well as competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements at this time the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument will primarily use acquity uplc columns in 2006 and 2005 excluding the small impact from acquisitions mentioned below the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in the xbridge tm  sunfire tm and acquity uplc columns as well as in oasis ® sample preparation cartridges 

 

in february 2006 the company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of vicam limited partnership “vicam” for 138 million in cash vicam is a leading provider of tests to identify and quantify toxins in various agricultural commodities the company’s test kits provide reliable quantitative detection of particular toxins through the choice of flurometer or hplc in december 2006 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of environmental resources associates inc “era” a provider of environmental testing products for quality control proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories for 625 million in cash and the assumption of 38 million of debt era also provides product 

support services required to help laboratories with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis 

 

based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

 

waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated alliance ® 2795 systems for high speed screening and with a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

 

the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance a commitment to supply software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a multiyear contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument 

 

mass spectrometry 

 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

 

the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

 

currently the company offers and provides service support and training for a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental market segments worldwide service sales included in waters division total service sales are primarily related to the sale of parts and labor associated with instrument repair and routine maintenance 

 

the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smaller sized mass spectrometers such as the sqd and the tqd are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc upgrade large quadrupole systems such as the waters quattro micro tm and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for late stage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof instruments such as the company’s qtof micro tm and qtof premier tm instruments are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in late 2006 the company also introduced a new tandem quadrupole device the tqd and a new hybrid quadrupole — time of flight technology system the synapt tm hdms the synapt hdms system integrates ion mobility technology within a qtof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows researchers to glean molecular shape information a novel capability for a mass spectrometry instrument the introduction of these new products has augmented the recent growth of the ms instrument systems in 2005 the company introduced a new enhanced tandem quadrupole instrument the quattro premier xe and the lct premier tm  the lct premier is 

an lc electrospraytof instrument designed to deliver a higher level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise quantitative analysis in 2004 the company introduced a new qtof configuration mass spectrometry system the qtof premier to replace its qtof ultima ® line of systems and offer a higher level of instrument performance to its customers the qtof premier is a tandem mass spectrometry system developed to provide increased levels of sensitivity and specificity to customers involved in challenging analyses such as those often encountered in proteomics and metabolite profiling experiments the company began shipping the qtof premier in the fourth quarter of 2004 the qtof premier is compatible and often purchased with a specialized acquity uplc as an inlet a device to efficiently introduce a separated sample into the mass spectrometer 

 

lcms 

 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and be operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell service and support integrated lcms systems

thermal analysis 

 

thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials such as their physical state weight dimension and mechanical and electrical properties which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques consequently thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development production and characterization of materials in various industries such as plastics chemicals automobiles pharmaceuticals and electronics 

 

rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or conditions the information obtained under such conditions provides insight to a material’s behavior during manufacturing transport usage and storage 

 

thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and in many cases provide information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial consumer goods and health care products as with systems offered through the waters division a range of instrumental configurations are available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation in addition systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications for example the qseries tm family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a variety of sample cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials in 2006 ta introduced four new differential scanning calorimeters during 2005 ta introduced a new thermogravimetric analyzer “tga” the q5000ir tga and a new arg2 rheometer the introduction of these new products significantly helped grow the ta business in 2006 and 2005 

 

in august 2006 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of thermometric ab “thermometrics” a manufacturer of high performance microcalorimeters for 25 million in cash and the assumption of 12 million in debt thermometrics’ flagship product the tam iii is a modular calorimeter that employs proprietary technology to deliver unparalleled calorimetric sensitivity and temperature stability it is routinely used to characterize materials and their interactions in the fields of pharmaceuticals life and materials sciences the tam iii systems complement ta’s industry leading qseries differential scanning calorimeter product line and enhances ta’s position as the world’s leading supplier of thermal analysis instrumentation 

 

the company sells supports and services these product offerings through ta headquartered in new castle delaware ta operates independently from the waters division though several of its overseas offices are situated in waters facilities ta has dedicated field sales and service operations service sales are primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from billed labor fees associated with the repair maintenance and upgrade of installed systems

 item 1a risk factors 

 

competition and the analytical instrument market 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc ms lcms thermal analysis and rheometry product lines is highly competitive and the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors’ businesses are generally more diversified and less focused on the company’s primary instrument markets there can be no assurances that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurances that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future 

 

additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 52 and 54 of the company’s net sales in 2006 and 2005 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

risk of disruption 

the company manufactures lc instruments at facilities in milford massachusetts and singapore separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis products at its facility in new castle delaware and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and crawley england any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to either facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

foreign operations and exchange rates 

approximately 68 and 66 of the company’s 2006 and 2005 net sales respectively were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 

 

additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

reliance on key management 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the key management employees has an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

protection of intellectual property 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurances that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company by third party patent holders with respect to certain company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

reliance on customer demand 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc ms thermal analysis and rheometry products the level of capital expenditures of the company’s customers the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations there can be no assurances that the company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above 

 

reliance on suppliers 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company the company believes alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

 

reliance on outside manufacturers 

certain components or modules of the company’s ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors in 2006 the company transitioned the manufacturing of the alliance hplc instrument system to a company in singapore disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin “sab” 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” accordingly revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified with respect to installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort 

 

sales of software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” nearly all of the company’s instruments contain embedded operating system and data management software which is included in the purchase price software is also sold separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant postdelivery obligations remain software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2006 was 2722 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 84 million historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 

 

the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2006 was 1684 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 143 million 

 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company’s current business model in 2004 the company recorded a 40 million charge for an otherthantemporary impairment of its technology licenses with sandia national laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 1317 million 1493 million and 2652 million respectively as of december 31 2006 the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill the company performed its annual review during 2006 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2006 the company’s warranty liability was 126 million 

 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

 

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 

 

as of december 31 2004 the company had determined that it was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of 1675 million of its deferred tax assets would not be realized the company had therefore recorded a cumulative 1675 million valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting purposes as of december 31 2004 the valuation allowance was determined based on the company’s review of its future estimated us taxable income levels and the estimated future stock option exercises included in this 1675 million valuation allowance was 1549 million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of nonqualified stock options as required by sfas no 109 and apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” the company had originally recorded all 1549 million of these future tax benefits as increased additional paidin capital accordingly when the company recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax benefits the company also reduced additional paidin capital by 1549 million 

 

as required by sfas no 109 the company maintained this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined during 2005 that it was more likely than not that it would realize the actual tax benefit of 925 million of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been previously provided the company made this determination based on the level of the company’s actual 2005 us taxable income the company’s projected future us taxable income levels the company’s actual 2005 tax deduction from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and the fact that the company’s future tax deduction from the exercise of nonqualified stock options would most likely be less than in the past as those options which were significantly inthemoney were expiring and exercised by december 31 2005 the company therefore recorded in 2005 a 925 million reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance because this reduction in the valuation allowance included 788 million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of nonqualified stock options the company also restored 788 million to the company’s additional paidin capital in 2005 in accordance with sfas no 109 and apb no 25 the remaining balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the company made in 2004 the company made the determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 

 

litigation 

as described in item 3 of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

 

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading “hewlettpackard company” as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

 

pension and other retirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 800 for its us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the company’s benefit obligation and expense 

 

at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2006 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december 31 2006 the company determined this rate to be 582 for the company’s us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the company’s 2006 benefit obligation and 2007 expense retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company’s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

 

a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately 04 million a onequarter percentage point change in the assumed longterm rate of return would impact the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately 02 million 

 

stockbased compensation 

the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” on january 1 2006 this standard requires that all sharebased payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has used the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be materially impacted as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas no 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 

 

the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas no 123r and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs associated with awards for 2006 now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december 31 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december 31 2005 the company recognizes the expense using the straightline attribution method 

 

the aftertax stockbased compensation and the impact to diluted earnings per share of adopting sfas no 123r for the year ended december 31 2006 were 206 million with a 020 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share respectively as of december 31 2006 the company has capitalized stockbased compensation costs of 06 million and 10 million to inventory and capitalized software respectively in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r the company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb no 25 and related interpretations including financial interpretation “fin” 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation” for its plans under this accounting method stockoption compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at the current fair 

value of the company’s common stock as of the date of the award generally did not require compensation expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations stockbased compensation expense recognized for the company’s fixed employee stock option plans restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan was 08 million in 2005 the 2005 stockbased compensation expense amounts were all recorded in selling and administrative expenses 

 

as of december 31 2006 unrecognized compensation costs and related weightedaverage lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

recent accounting standards changes 

 

in january 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” and sab 107 “sharebased payment” these standards require that all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values the adoption of these standards did have a material effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations see note 13 stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

in january 2006 the company adopted sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change the adoption of sfas no 154 did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in january 2006 the company adopted sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments — an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” this standard permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation clarifies which interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 133 requires evaluation of interests in securitized financial assets clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying specialpurpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument this standard is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 the company does not believe that adoption of sfas no 155 will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this interpretation prescribes new methodology by which a company must measure report present and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take the interpretation requires financial 

statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of the tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances but it prohibits any discounting of these effects for the time value of money in addition the interpretation also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax reporting positions the interpretation will become effective in the first quarter of 2007 the company is still evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this standard addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” this standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is in the process of evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” which amends sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” sfas no 106 “employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” and sfas no 132r “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” this standard requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income this standard also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position in addition this statement will require disclosure of the effects of the unrecognized gains or losses prior service costs and transition asset or obligation on the next fiscal year’s net periodic benefit cost this standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and retrospective application of this standard is not permitted the adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the company’s financial position see note 16 retirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the impact of adopting this pronouncement 

 

in september 2006 the sec issued sab 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” this standard addresses quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements specifically how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements this standard is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines 

 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and cash flow and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen and british pound the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

 

the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified 

intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

 

cash flow hedges 

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 2000 million to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt with a maturity date of june 2007 for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax realized gain of 05 million and in december 2006 the company closed out the swap resulting in a pretax gain of 04 million the gain was deferred and will be recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate swap for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax unrealized loss of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement 

 

during the first quarter of 2004 the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 1250 million to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt with a maturity date of 21 months the company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 with a realized gain of 16 million the total pretax amount of the gain that was recognized in earnings in 2004 was 07 million the remaining 09 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap 

 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 34 of its sales denominated in euros 11 in yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2006 as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 

 

during 2006 and 2005 the company hedged its net investment in euro foreign affiliates with crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from approximately 300 million to approximately 1000 million at december 31 2006 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately 1000 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 110 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 97 million and unrealized losses of 13 million at december 31 2005 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately 500 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 07 million relating to closed euro crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar the fair market value of the crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operation as of december 31 2006 would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 100 million 

 

during 2005 and 2004 the company hedged its net investment in yen foreign affiliates with japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from approximately 260 million to approximately 370 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 the notional amounts of the outstanding contracts were zero and 370 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax realized losses of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded cumulative pretax losses of 24 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 

16 million related to closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of 08 million relating to the open japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

 

during 2005 and 2004 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in british pounds ranging from approximately £250 million to £750 million under the terms of the agreements the company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell british pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy british pounds with option premiums that offset at december 31 2005 the company had range forward agreements in british pounds with a notional amount of £300 million outstanding for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 61 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 58 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of 03 million related to the open british pound range forward agreements at december 31 2004 the company had no range forward agreements in british pounds outstanding for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded a realized cumulative net pretax loss of 86 million to accumulated other comprehensive income related to the closed range forward agreements 

 

during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds at december 31 2005 the company had no forward exchange contracts in british pounds used to hedge its net investment position for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a realized gain of 16 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 05 million related to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of 02 million related to the british pound forward agreements 

 

other 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen and british pound the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 709 million and 729 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 39 million which consists of realized gains of 25 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 14 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 05 million which consists of realized gains of 15 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 10 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 46 million which consists of realized gains of 45 million on closed forward contracts and a 01 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts 

 

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts as of december 31 2006 would decrease earnings by approximately 71 million 

 

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with weightedaverage original maturities of 90 days or less in commercial paper bank deposits repurchase agreements and money market funds cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value the company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials the company believes that hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

  the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs to develop manufacturing methods and to assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies and in many instances the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

  traditionally a typical hplc system has consisted of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

  in march 2004 waters introduced a novel technology that the company described as ultraperformance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc tm  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using the acquity uplc researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using acquity uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of application beyond that of hplc enabling the uncovering of new levels of scientific information though it offers significant performance advantages acquity uplc is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc in the third quarter of 2004 during 2005 the company experienced growth in the instrument systems product line primarily from the sales of the acquity uplc 

  the primary consumable products for lc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the lc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

  waters hplc columns can be used on waters branded as well as competitors’ lc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements at this time the company believes that its acquity uplc lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its acquity uplc instrument and furthermore that its acquity uplc instrument will primarily use acquity uplc columns 

  in 2005 the company experienced growth in its lc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in the xbridge tm  sunfire tm and acquity uplc columns as well as in oasis ® 

4 sample preparation cartridges during 2004 the company experienced growth in these businesses mainly due to xterra ® and atlantis ® columns which were newly introduced in 2003 

  based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of lc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading lc market share in the united states europe and nonjapan asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

  waters manufactures lc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated alliance ® 2795 systems for high speed screening and with a variety of detection technologies from ultraviolet “uv” absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses the company also manufactures tailored lc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as an lc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of lc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

  the servicing and support of lc and ms instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance a commitment to supply software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a multiyear contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument 

  in 2004 the company introduced a new product the electronic laboratory notebook “elab notebook tm ” designed to replace and augment the paperbased safekeeping and archiving of laboratory procedures and results in combination with the company’s scientific data management system “sdms” product elab notebook functions as a portal to laboratory scale information storage and retrieval systems as well as a flexible and personally manageable notation and display device the pricing of elab notebook is based upon the number of users or seats that the customer decides to purchase the company began shipping elab notebook in the fourth quarter of 2004 the company’s existing server based software products millenium ® and empower tm  are now augmented by the addition of the elab notebook’s internet or “web” based software that enables the reporting of scientific data sourced from a broader array of instruments 

mass spectrometry 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

  the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as lc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

  currently the company offers and provides service support and training for a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to utilize an lc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental market segments worldwide service sales included in waters division total service sales are primarily related to the sale of parts and labor associated with instrument repair and routine maintenance 

5   the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for lc the company’s smaller sized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole zq tm and waters emd are often referred to as lc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an lc system or as an lc upgrade tandem quadrupole systems such as the waters quattro micro tm and quattro premier tm xe instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for late stage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof instruments such as the company’s qtof micro tm and qtof premier tm instruments are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” in 2005 the company introduced a new enhanced tandem quadrupole instrument the quattro premier xe the introduction of the quattro premier xe helped to grow the overall ms business in 2005 the lct premier tm is an lc electrospraytof instrument designed to deliver a higher level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise quantitative analysis in 2004 the company introduced a new qtof configuration mass spectrometry system the qtof premier to replace its qtof ultima line of systems and offer a higher level of instrument performance to its customers the qtof premier is a tandem mass spectrometry system developed to provide increased levels of sensitivity and specificity to customers involved in challenging analyses such as those often encountered in proteomics and metabolite profiling experiments the company began shipping the qtof premier in the fourth quarter of 2004 the qtof premier is compatible and often purchased with a specialized acquity uplc as an inlet a device to efficiently introduce a separated sample into the mass spectrometer 

lcms 

lc and ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and be operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell service and support integrated lcms systems 

ta division 

thermal analysis 

thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials such as their physical state weight dimension and mechanical and electrical properties which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques consequently thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development production and characterization of materials in various industries such as plastics chemicals automobiles pharmaceuticals and electronics 

  rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or conditions the information obtained under such conditions provides insight to a material’s behavior during manufacturing transport usage and storage 

  thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and in many cases provide information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial consumer goods and health care products as with systems offered through the waters division a range of instrumental configurations are available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation in addition systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications for example the qseries family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample 

6 handlers and a variety of sample cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials in 2005 ta introduced a new thermogravimetric analyzer “tga” the q5000ir tga and a new arg2 rheometer the introduction of these new products significantly helped grow the ta business in 2005 in the first quarter of 2003 ta expanded its rheometry product line through the acquisition of rheometrics scientific inc “rheometrics” during 2003 the rheometrics product line was successfully integrated within the ta instruments division 

  the company sells supports and services these product offerings through ta headquartered in new castle delaware the ta division operates independently from the waters division though several of its overseas offices are situated in waters facilities ta has dedicated field sales and service operations service sales primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from billed labor fees associated with the repair maintenance and upgrade of installed systems

competition and the analytical instrument market 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc ms lcms thermal analysis and rheometry product lines is highly competitive and the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are more diversified than the company’s 

10 business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurances that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurances that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future 

  additionally the analytical instrument market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 51 and 53 of the company’s net sales in 2005 and 2004 respectively were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

risk of disruption 

the company manufactures lc instruments at its facility in milford massachusetts separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis products at its facility in new castle delaware and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and crawley england any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to either facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

foreign operations and exchange rates 

approximately 65 of the company’s 2005 net sales were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 

  additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

reliance on key management 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the key management employees has an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s operations could be adversely affected 

protection of intellectual property 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurances that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company where its intellectual property does not cover competitor products or is invalidated the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations and financial conditions 

reliance on customer demand 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its lc ms thermal analysis and rheometry products the level of capital expenditures of the company’s customers the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations there can be no assurances that the company’s results of operations will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above 

reliance on suppliers 

most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company the company believes alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

reliance on outside manufacturers 

certain components or modules of the company’s ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors additionally in 2006 the company will begin outsourcing some of the manufacturing of the alliance hplc instrument system to an outside manufacturer disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

business and financial overview 

the company’s sales grew 5 in 2005 over 2004 and 15 in 2004 over 2003 sales in constant currency grew 5 in 2005 and 11 in 2004 in 2005 the company’s business was impacted by a weakness in demand from the company’s large pharmaceutical customers while sales to all other customers increased 7 in 2005 over 2004 this increase in sales was driven primarily by the company’s food and environmental testing government and university and fine chemical customers demand for the company’s products from us pharmaceutical customers was constrained due to new drug pipeline issues and the effects of merger and litigation issues affecting those customers in 2005 which led to a reduction in capital spending in comparison to the 2004 levels despite this weakness in the us sales to nonus based pharmaceutical customers increased 8 in 2005 this sales growth was driven primarily by the company’s new products the acquity uplc tm  the qtof premier tm and quattro premier tm xe systems 

  geographically sales growth in 2005 before the effects of currency translation was strongest in japan 10 and asia 12 particularly india and china while sales in the us 2 and europe 4 grew more modestly in order to capitalize on the strong sales growth anticipated in asia and japan in 2006 

16 the company expects to accelerate its investment in these operations and fund this investment in part by managing expense growth in other geographies these realignment efforts will result in onetime expenses in 2006 

  from a product line perspective and excluding the impact of currency translation waters division lc sales grew approximately 6 in 2005 and benefited from the shipment of acquity uplc systems growth in service sales of 9 and growth in lc chemical product sales of 9 in ms sales grew approximately 2 in 2005 as fullyear growth in the shipments of the new qtof premier and quattro premier systems was offset by softer sales of single quadrupole and magnetic sector devices the thermal analysis division “ta” sales grew approximately 9 in 2005 benefiting from overall stronger industrial chemical customer demand recent new product introductions and from the expansion of its business into asian markets 

  in february 2006 the company began implementing a cost reduction plan primarily affecting operations in the us and europe that resulted in the employment of approximately 70 employees being terminated with effective dates through the third quarter of 2006 in addition the company plans to close a sales and demonstration office in the netherlands in the third quarter of 2006 the company expects to incur a onetime estimated restructuring charge in 2006 in the range of 50 million to 70 million the company expects the entire restructuring plan to be completed by the third quarter of 2006 cash expenditures associated with this restructuring are estimated to be similar to the timing of recording the expense the company is implementing this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world 

  operating income was 2832 million and 2849 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively a decrease of 17 million operating income in 2005 was impacted by a litigation provision of 31 million related to a patent litigation settlement with hewlettpackard company in february 2006 in 2004 operating income included the benefit of a litigation judgment in the amount of 171 million from perkinelmer corporation partially offset by the sum of litigation provisions of 78 million and a technology license asset impairment of 40 million the remaining increase in operating income of 67 million was primarily a result of sales growth 

  operating cash flow increased to 2981 million in 2005 compared to 2594 million in 2004 the increase of 387 million in 2005 is primarily attributable to improvements in dayssalesoutstanding “dso” and improving inventory turns dso improved to 70 days in 2005 from 76 days in 2004 while inventory turns improved to 36 turns in 2005 from 33 turns in 2004 capital expenditures related to property plant equipment software capitalization and other intangibles were 510 million in 2005 compared to 662 million in 2004 in 2004 capital expenditures included the purchase of a building adjacent to the company’s headquarters in milford massachusetts costing 181 million 

  in 2005 the board of directors of the company approved the repatriation of 5000 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the company will use the repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses and investments in the us in connection with this distribution all repatriated in the second half of 2005 the company recorded 240 million of federal state and foreign income taxes excluding the impact of this onetime income tax expense the company’s effective rate was 177 compared to 216 in 2004 as a result of the relative increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates primarily ireland 

  in october of 2005 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 5000 million of its outstanding common shares over a twoyear period the company has repurchased 56 million shares at a cost of 2161 million under this new program through december 31 2005 during 2005 the company repurchased a total of 154 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 6593 million this total includes share repurchases associated with the october 2005 program as well as previously authorized share repurchase programs the company believes that the share repurchase programs are beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the number of outstanding shares the company also believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given 

17 current cash and debt levels and invest in research technology acquisitions and business acquisitions to further grow the company’s sales and profits 

  in october 2005 the company fully exercised the 1000 million expansion feature in the credit agreement dated december 2004 increasing the amount from 7000 million to 8000 million in november 2005 the company entered into a new credit agreement that provides for a 2500 million term loan facility as of december 31 2005 the company had 5000 million of longterm debt and 3100 million of shortterm debt under these credit agreements for a total of 8100 million outstanding as compared to 4400 million outstanding at december 31 2004 2500 million of which was classified as longterm debt the company plans to use the proceeds of the term loan to finance the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase program previously approved by its board of directors and for general corporate purposes the company also believes that this additional borrowing capacity will provide the company the flexibility to fund working capital needs and potential acquisitions

net sales 

net sales in 2005 were 11582 million an increase of 5 compared to sales of 11045 million in 2004 foreign currency translation had no effect overall on sales growth in 2005 in 2005 product sales increased 279 million or 3 and service sales increased 258 million or 9 over sales in 2004 the increase in product sales is primarily due to the continued strength of lc ms and ta instrument sales growth increases in sales of chromatography columns and consumables and particularly the fullyear sales in 2005 of the acquity uplc system the increase in service sales is primarily due to growth in the company’s instrument installed base and sales of service contracts the company expects sales to grow in 2006 from higher sales of new products and service sales growth in both of its operating divisions 

  the following commentary discusses the company’s sales performance by product line in constant currencies 

waters division net sales 

with respect to the waters division’s performance by product line overall lc sales in 2005 grew approximately 6 the growth in lc instrument sales in 2005 was 3 this growth was due principally to the fullyear impact of products introduced in 2004 such as the acquity uplc instrument in combination with demand for existing lc instruments in 2005 the sales of lc consumables sample preparation devices and chromatography columns grew 9 primarily as a result of continued strength in demand from the introduction of the new xbridge tm  sunfire tm and acquity uplc chromatography columns and oasis ® sample preparation cartridges service sales in 2005 grew 9 over 2004 due to increased sales of service plans to the company’s growing installed base of customers for the lc business service sales were approximately 33 of total lc revenue in 2005 as compared to 32 in 2004 service sales growth was geographically broadbased and was driven by increased demand primarily from large multinational customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed waters instruments and their newly purchased waters instruments lc consumables accounted for approximately 18 of overall lc sales in 2005 and 2004 

  ms sales grew approximately 2 in 2005 the increase in sales over 2004 is primarily the result of an increase in qtof premier and quattro premier xe system sales substantially offset by weak single quadrupole and magnetic sector instrument sales the company plans to introduce new ms instruments in 2006 that it believes should refresh a substantial portion of its quadrupolebased ms instrument sales 

  geographically waters lc sales grew 11 in asia and 9 in japan while the us and european sales grew 3 and 5 respectively ms sales were strongest in japan growing at 8 while ms sales in the us declined 6 the company believes that the ms sales in the us were significantly and negatively impacted by the weak demand from the company’s large pharmaceutical customers sales growth rates in asia and japan were driven by business associated with pharmaceutical industry demand in india and more broadbased growth in china increased regulations for food and drinking water testing also contributed to sales growth in japan and in asia 

18 ta instruments division net sales 

sales for thermal analysis instruments rheometry instruments and related service sales grew 9 in 2005 strong demand for ta products from customers outside of the us contributed to the division’s overall sales growth sales growth for ta outside of the us was 15 in 2005 compared to 2004 strong demand for the division’s products in japan and in asia overall associated with expanded sales and marketing efforts were especially important factors in effecting the division’s positive sales growth performance sales in the us grew 3 in 2005 and 2004 service sales were approximately 27 and 26 respectively of overall revenue and grew approximately 16 in 2005 primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2005 was 6799 million compared to 6497 million for 2004 an increase of 302 million or 5 and generally consistent with the increase in net sales gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 587 in 2005 from 588 in 2004 the slight decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to a higher mix of more costly new products in particular the acquity uplc instrument as well as lower sales of higher margin ms instruments these factors negatively affecting gross profit percentage were partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin chromatography consumables and service sales the company expects that gross margin percent will decline slightly in 2006 as a result of the continued higher sales of new products with higher manufacturing costs transitional expenses associated with the movement of alliance instrument system production to singapore as well as due to the expensing of stock options under statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses for 2005 and 2004 were 3217 million and 3002 million respectively as a percentage of net sales selling and administrative expenses increased to 278 for 2005 compared to 272 for 2004 the 215 million or 7 increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2005 is primarily attributable to the following an increase of approximately 41 million as a result of foreign currency effects that included a reduction of 22 million in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains annual merit increases effective in april in both years and other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs of approximately 154 million an increase in travel expenses of approximately 64 million and an increase in expenses associated with a new building in milford massachusetts acquired in 2004 the impact of these increases was primarily offset by lower management incentive compensation expense derived from 2005 financial results the company expects that selling and administrative expenses will grow in 2006 at a percentage rate that is slightly lower than the expected sales growth rate this slower growth in expenses will be effected through cost reduction efforts that will result in a onetime charge in 2006 this outlook does not include the effect of expensing of stock options under sfas no 123r 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses were 669 million for 2005 and 652 million for 2004 an increase of 17 million or 3 the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount as the company continues to invest in the development of new and improved lc ms thermal analysis and rheometry products the company expects research and development expenses to grow in 2006 at a similar rate to sales growth this anticipated growth rate does not include the effect of expensing of stock options under sfas no 123r

interest expense 

interest expense was 247 million and 101 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in 2005 interest expense is primarily attributable to a combination of additional borrowings in the us to fund the stock repurchase programs and higher interest rates on the company’s outstanding debt 

interest income 

interest income for 2005 and 2004 was 193 million and 119 million respectively the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields

impact of new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” this standard requires that all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be recognized in the statement of 

20 operations based on their fair values this charge will be allocated to line items within the consolidated statements of operations based on underlying employee service the company will begin recognizing these charges in the three months ending april 1 2006 under the modified prospective method the final standard allows alternative methods for determining fair value the company will use the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stockbased compensation awards the company has made changes to its equity compensation structure and will begin granting a combination of restricted stock units and nonqualified stock options the company estimates that the adoption of sfas no 123r will result in a negative impact to earnings per diluted share net of tax of approximately 021 to 024 in 2006

expensed inprocess research and development 

in 2003 in connection with the acquisition of creon the company wrote off the fair value of purchased inprocess research and development “iprd” of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of 60 million the amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses as of the creon acquisition date the “acquisition date” there were four projects that met the above criteria the significant iprd projects identified consist of the elab notebook and the automatic lcms dereplication system the iprd charges associated with these projects were 45 million and 08 million respectively 

  management determined the valuation of the iprd using a number of factors including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of the projects ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects iii whether the projects had an alternative future use and iv the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 

  the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality as of the acquisition date none of the iprd projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality in assessing the technological feasibility of a project consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome 

  future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management’s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management’s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion the discount rates include a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized the cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from 55 to 60 per annum depending on the project’s stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed this discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased iprd resulted in a total valuation of 60 million although work on the projects related to the iprd continued after the acquisition the amount of the purchase price allocated to iprd was written off because the projects underlying the iprd that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date 

other income expense net 

in 2004 and 2003 the company recorded 10 million and 03 million respectively of pretax charges for otherthantemporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments the 2004 pretax 

24 charge of 10 million is for the company’s remaining investment carrying value of geneprot this charge was recorded based on the company’s current assessment of geneprot’s financial condition 

interest expense 

interest expense was 101 million and 24 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in 2004 interest expense is primarily attributed to the additional borrowings in the us to fund the stock repurchase programs 

interest income 

interest income for 2004 and 2003 was 119 million and 71 million respectively the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate was 216 in 2004 and 236 in 2003 the change in effective tax rates for the period was impacted by the net tax effect of the perkinelmer litigation judgment received and litigation provisions and restructuring charges made during 2004 compared to the tax effect of certain litigation provisions restructuring charges expensed inprocess research and development and loss on sale of a business incurred during 2003 the effective tax rates excluding these items and corresponding tax effects were 210 and 230 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates primarily ireland 

liquidity and capital resources 

  net cash provided by operating activities was 2981 million 2594 million and 1570 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the primary sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities aside from net income and reasons for their change are as follows depreciation and amortization have increased over the three years presented as a result of higher capital spending on equipment and facilities and the fullyear impact of acquisitions particularly in 2005 and 2004 deferred income taxes decreased in 2005 primarily as a result of the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards the change in the tax benefit related to stock option plans is primarily attributable to the significant exercises of stock options in 2003 and 

25 2004 related to previously granted options about to expire which had low exercise prices the change in accounts receivable is primarily related to the timing of the company’s sales within the quarter the timing of cash receipts from customers and foreign currency translation dso at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 70 days 76 days and 71 days respectively the growth in inventory over the three years is primarily related to the company’s sales growth and the introduction of new products most recently the acquity uplc system although inventory levels have grown they have not increased at the same rate of sales growth thus resulting in improved inventory turns of 36 33 and 31 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  the changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities are primarily related to the increase in income tax accruals resulting from the repatriation of funds in 2005 and timing of payments of income tax compensation and retirement accruals during the three years presented the 2005 change in accrued litigation is attributed to payment of legal fees directly associated with existing litigation accruals and a provision of 31 million relating to patent litigation with hewlettpackard company which was settled in february 2006 the 2004 change in accrued litigation of 161 million is primarily due to the 181 million payment to applied biosystems mds sciex instruments for the settlement of a patent litigation matter and a 78 million provision offset by approximately 41 million of payments in connection with the hewlettpackard patent litigation matter the 2003 change in accrued litigation of 601 million is primarily attributed to the company paying 596 million in connection with both the applera patent litigation and the dep settlement changes in deferred revenue and customer advances are primarily attributable to the company’s growth in service sales contracts and the timing of contract billings 

  net cash used in investing activities totaled 510 million in 2005 compared to 1086 million in 2004 and 187 million in 2003 additions to fixed assets and intangible assets were 510 million in 2005 662 million in 2004 and 346 million in 2003 included in 2004 was a 250000 square foot building purchase adjacent to the company’s headquarters in milford massachusetts for 181 million as well as approximately 32 million of costs in construction inprogress related to improvements made to the building aside from the purchase of this building fixed asset and intangible asset additions were consistent with capital spending trends and expectations throughout the respective years to accommodate the company’s growth business acquisitions were 424 million and 352 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively there were no business acquisitions in 2005 in addition net cash used by investing activities in 2003 benefited from the release of the restricted cash related to a payment made to applera for an unfavorable judgment in patent litigation 

  regarding cash provided by used in financing activities the company repurchased 154 million 55 million and 119 million common stock shares at a cost of 6593 million 2313 million and 3246 million respectively during 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively under previously announced programs on october 24 2005 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 5000 million of its outstanding common shares over a twoyear period the company repurchased 56 million shares at a cost of 2161 million under this new program through december 31 2005 leaving 2839 million authorized for repurchases in the future the company believes that these share repurchase programs benefit shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the outstanding shares while maintaining adequate financial flexibility given current cash and debt levels to fund future share repurchases and pursue acquisition opportunities the company received 168 million 450 million and 278 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plans in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004 and 2003 were unusually high due to significant exercises of stock options related to previously granted options about to expire 

  in november 2005 the company entered into a new credit agreement the “november 2005 credit agreement” that provides for a 2500 million term loan facility due in november 2010 the company may on a single occasion request of the lender group that the facility be increased up to an additional 1000 million the company plans to use the proceeds of the term loan to finance the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase program previously approved by its board of directors and for general corporate purposes the interest rates applicable to any us borrowings under the november 2005 credit agreement are at the company’s option equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 12 or on any euro borrowings the applicable 1 2 3 6 9 or 12 month libor 

26 rate in each case plus an interest rate margin based upon the company’s leverage ratio which can range between 375 basis points and 1125 basis points the november 2005 credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3501 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3251 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters respectively in addition the november 2005 credit agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in the company’s existing credit facility the november 2005 credit agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties affirmative covenants and events of default similar in nature to those in the company’s existing credit facility 

  in december 2004 the company had entered into a syndicated committed credit agreement the “credit agreement” that provides for a 2500 million term loan facility due in december 2009 and subsequent to the amendment discussed below a 4500 million revolving facility which includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility in october 2005 the company fully exercised the 1000 million expansion feature in the credit agreement dated december 2004 increasing the amount from 7000 million to 8000 million the company used the proceeds of the additional borrowings to finance the repurchase of common stock and for general corporate purposes as provided for under the credit agreement in october 2005 the company amended the credit agreement the “amended credit agreement” to increase the leverage ratio test from not more than 301 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to 3251 and to amend the definition of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to exclude stockbased compensation to the extent deducted from consolidated net income pursuant to statement sfas no 123r all other terms and conditions under the original credit agreement with respect to interest rates interest coverage ratio test maturity dates and affirmative and negative covenants remained substantially the same in the amended credit agreement 

  as of december 31 2005 the company had 2500 million borrowed under the november 2005 credit agreement and 5600 million under the amended credit agreement for a total of 8100 million borrowed under the two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of 2384 million after outstanding letters of credit in total 5000 million of the total debt was classified as longterm debt and 3100 million classified as shortterm debt at december 31 2005 in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2004 the company had aggregate borrowings under the amended credit agreement of 4400 million of which 2500 million was classified as longterm debt the remaining amounts of shortterm debt of 163 million and 167 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively represent various local lines of credit throughout the company’s worldwide subsidiaries 

  the company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of 4936 million at the end of 2005 and expected cash flow from operating activities together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital capital spending requirements authorized share repurchase amounts potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months management believes as of the date of this report that its financial position along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external sources will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

summary 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its policies and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there are other items within the company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets once the product is shipped all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order the company’s products generally carry one year of warranty these costs are accrued at the point of shipment once the warranty period has expired the customer may purchase a service contract service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straightline basis over the contract term at december 31 2005 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of approximately 717 million and 80 million respectively 

  product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured the company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” accordingly revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured and if applicable upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period with respect to installation obligations the larger of the contractual cash 

29 holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort 

  sales of software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” nearly all of the company’s instruments contain embedded operating system and data management software which is included in the purchase price software is also sold separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant postdelivery obligations remain software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer industry trends and the macroeconomic environment sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2005 was 2568 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 66 million historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 

  the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2005 was 1316 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 134 million 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

   when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company’s current business model in 2004 the company recorded a 40 million charge for an otherthantemporary impairment of its technology licenses with sandia national laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 844 million 1410 million and 2106 million respectively as of december 31 2005 the company performs annual impairment 

30 reviews of its goodwill the company performed its annual review during 2005 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

warranty 

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2005 the company’s warranty liability was 117 million 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely the company must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

  the company has a significant income tax benefit associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options recorded to additional paidin capital historically the company believed that it was more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets associated with this tax benefit would not be realized and as a result a valuation allowance was established for all the deferred tax assets relating to us income this valuation allowance against us assets was maintained until an appropriate level of taxable income in the us could be sustained in 2005 the company believed it had reached an appropriate sustainable level of profitability in the us therefore 925 million of the valuation allowance was reversed of which 788 million was credited to additional paidin capital and the balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the company made in 2004 the company made this determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 

litigation 

as described in item 3 of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

  with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading “hewlettpackard company” as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

31 pension and other postretirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 800 for its us definedbenefit pension plan which is the majority of the company’s benefit obligation and expense 

  at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody’s aa interest rate as of december 31 2005 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at yearend 2005 the company determined this rate to be 550 for its us definedbenefit pension plan which is the majority of the company’s benefit obligation and expense postretirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company’s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

  a onequarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately 04 million a onequarter percentage point change in the assumed longterm rate of return would impact the company’s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately 01 million 

recent accounting standards changes 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued at the present time the company does not believe that adoption of sfas 154 will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which is an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” the interpretation requires a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated the interpretation is effective for years ending after december 15 2005 the interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” this standard requires that all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values the standard is effective for public companies for the first annual period beginning after june 15 2005 the final standard allows alternative methods for determining fair value the company will use the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of its stockbased compensation awards the company has made changes to its equity compensation structure and will begin granting a combination of restricted stock units and nonqualified stock options the company estimates that the adoption of sfas no 123r under the modified prospective method will result in a negative impact to earnings per diluted share net of tax of approximately 021 to 024 in 2006 

32   in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 107 “sharebased payments” which expresses the sec staff’s views regarding the application of sfas no 123r as noted above the adoption of sfas no 123r as applied using standards set forth in sab 107 will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations and financial position 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets” which amends accounting principles board opinion no 29 this standard requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 and should be applied prospectively the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities this standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 at the present time the company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 2000 million to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt with a maturity date of june 2007 for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax unrealized losses of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement during the first quarter of 2004 the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 1250 million to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt with a maturity date of 21 months the company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 with a realized gain of 16 million the total pretax amount of the gain that was recognized in earnings in 2004 was 07 million the remaining 09 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap 

33   assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in interest rates the fair market value of the floating to fixed rate interest rate swap would decrease by approximately 27 million and increase interest expense by approximately 20 million 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 30 of its sales denominated in euros 12 in yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2005 as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 

  during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in euro foreign affiliates with crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from approximately 300 million to approximately 500 million at december 31 2005 the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately 500 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 07 million relating to closed euro crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

  during 2005 and 2004 the company hedged its net investment in yen foreign affiliates with japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from approximately 260 million to approximately 370 million respectively at december 31 2005 and 2004 the notional amounts of the outstanding contracts were zero and 370 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax realized losses of 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded cumulative pretax losses of 24 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized losses of 16 million related to closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of 08 million relating to the open japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 16 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 13 million relating to the closed japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized gains of 03 million relating to the open japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements 

  during 2005 and 2004 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in british pounds ranging from approximately £250 million to £750 million under the terms of the agreements the company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell british pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy british pounds with option premiums that offset at december 31 2005 the company had range forward agreements in british pounds with a notional amount of £300 million outstanding for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 61 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 58 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of 03 million related to the open british pound range forward agreements at december 31 2004 the company had no range forward agreements in british pounds outstanding for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded a realized cumulative net pretax loss of 86 million to accumulated other comprehensive income related to the closed range forward agreements 

  during 2005 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds at december 31 2005 the company had no forward exchange contracts in british pounds used to hedge its net investment position for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded a realized gain of 16 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the company 

34 recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consists of realized gains of 05 million related to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of 02 million related to the british pound forward agreements as of december 31 2004 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds with a notional amount of approximately £450 million outstanding for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recorded realized losses of 33 million in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds that were entered into and closed in 2003 as of december 31 2003 the company had no open forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds 

  assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar the fair market value of the crosscurrency interest rate swap range forwards and foreign exchange contracts agreements designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operations as of december 31 2005 would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 104 million 

other 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen and british pound the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 729 million and 629 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 05 million which consists of realized gains of 15 million relating to the closed forward contracts and 10 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 46 million which consists of realized gains of 45 million on closed forward contracts and a 01 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recorded cumulative pretax gains of 54 million which consists of realized gains of 46 million on closed forward contracts and 08 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts 

  assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts as of december 31 2005 would decrease earnings by approximately 73 million 

  the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less in repurchase agreements and money market funds cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value the company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits

general 

waters corporation “waters” or the “company” an analytical instrument manufacturer designs manufactures sells and services through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” ultra performance liquid chromatography “uplc” together with hplc herein referred to as “lc” and mass spectrometry “ms” instrument systems and associated service and support products including chromatography columns and other consumable products additionally and as a result of the acquisitions by waters division of creon lab control ag “creon” in july 2003 and nugenesis technologies corporation “nugenesis” in february 2004 the company entered the laboratory informatics market “laboratory informatics” which consists of laboratorytoenterprise scale software systems for managing and storing scientific information collected from a wide variety of instrument test methods through its ta instruments division “ta” the company designs manufactures sells and services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial consumer goods and health care products the company is also a developer of and supplier of software based products which interface with the company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system 

  the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial academic and government customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s lc instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full range of compounds ms instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” food safety analyses and environmental testing the company’s thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals and polymers for uses in various industrial consumer goods and health care products 

  waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary the company previously operated as the waters chromatography division of millipore corporation prior to a management buyout of the division that became effective on august 18 1994 waters became a publicly traded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of micromass limited “micromass” in september 1997 and ta in may 1996 

business segments 

the company evaluated its business activities that are regularly reviewed by the chief executive officer for which discrete financial information is available as a result of this evaluation the company determined that it has two operating segments waters division and ta division 

  as indicated above the company operates in the analytical instruments industry manufacturing distributing and servicing products in three complementary technologies lc instruments columns and other consumables ms and thermal analysis and rheometry instruments laboratory informatics consists of laboratorytoenterprise scale software systems for managing and storing scientific information collected from a wide variety of lc and ms instrument test methods and is an integral product line within the waters division 

  the company’s two operating segments waters division and ta have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes

high performance and ultra performance liquid chromatography 

developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications 

  the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs to develop manufacturing methods and to assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as the identification of food content for nutritional labeling in the food and beverage industry the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies and in many instances the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

  a complete hplc system consists of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector 

  the primary “consumable products” for hplc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the hplc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

  waters columns can be used on waters branded as well as competitors’ hplc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements 

  during 2003 and 2004 the company experienced growth in its hplc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in the xterra tm and atlantis tm columns as well as in oasis tm sample preparation cartridges all newly introduced in 2003 in 2004 the company introduced a new column brand called sunfire tm  

  based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of hplc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading hplc market share in the united states europe and nonjapan asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan 

  waters manufactures hplc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from breeze tm systems for academic research applications to fully automated alliance®2795 systems for high speed screening and with a variety of detection technologies from uv absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses in 2003 the company introduced new application tailored hplc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as a new hplc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of hplc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection 

  in march 2004 waters introduced a novel hplctype technology that the company described as ultraperformance liquid chromatography which utilizes a packing material with narrow diameter particles and a specialized instrument the acquity uplc tm  to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow 

4 chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles by using uplc and the acquity instrument researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by hplc in addition in using uplc researchers have the potential to extend the range of application beyond that of hplc enabling the uncovering of new levels of scientific information though uplc and the acquity instrument are an extension of hplc the instrument is compatible with the company’s software products and the general operating protocols of hplc for these reasons the company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument the company began shipping the acquity uplc system for demonstration and evaluation in the second quarter of 2004 with a normalized shipping plan similar delivery schedules as compared to hplc products beginning in the third quarter of 2004 

  the servicing and support of lc instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance a commitment to supply software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a one or two year contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument 

  in the third quarter of 2003 waters expanded its data management product lines through the acquisition of creon and further enhanced its capability in this area through the acquisition of nugenesis in the first quarter of 2004 these new laboratory informatics software products available for sale by the waters division as a result of these acquisitions expand the range of the company’s information management offerings the company’s existing server based software products millenium® and empower tm  are now augmented by the addition of creon’s internet or “web” based software that enables the reporting of scientific data sourced from a broader array of instruments 

  broadly defined laboratory informatics products are involved with the safe keeping and organization of laboratory procedures and experimental results the products developed by creon and nugenesis are softwarebased systems designed to accommodate the general information archiving and retrieving needs of laboratories involved in instrumental analyses typically within pharmaceutical chemical and academic institutions customers buying these products are often using them to replace paperbased or internally developed home grown softwarebased systems that lack the capacity security and ease of use that is either desired or required the company feels it has retained the development resources from the acquired companies to ensure continued leadership in this emerging market and plans to continue selling and supporting its informatics customers through the worldwide fieldbased resources of the waters division augmented by a smaller group of specialists 

  in 2004 the company introduced a new informatics product the electronic laboratory notebook “elab notebook tm ” designed to replace and augment the paperbased safekeeping and archiving of laboratory procedures and results in combination with the company’s scientific data management system “sdms” product elab notebook functions as a portal to laboratory scale information storage and retrieval systems as well as a flexible and personally manageable notation and display device the pricing of elab notebook is based upon the number of users or seats that the customer decides to purchase the company began shipping elab notebook in the fourth quarter of 2004 

mass spectrometry 

mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions 

  the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as hplc uplc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography gas chromatography and elemental analysis systems a wide variety of instrumental designs fall 

5 within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments 

  currently the company offers and provides service support and training for a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by waters are designed to utilize an hplc or uplc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental markets worldwide service revenues are primarily related to the sale of parts and to billed labor associated with instrument repair and routine maintenance 

  the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for hplc and uplc the company’s smaller sized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole zq tm and waters emd tm  are often referred to as hplc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an hplc system or as an hplc upgrade tandem quadrupole systems such as the waters quattro micro tm and quattro ultima® instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for late stage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof instruments such as the company’s qtof micro tm and qtof ultima® instruments are typically used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” 

  in 2003 the company introduced two new mass spectrometry systems the quattro premier tm and the lct premier tm  the quattro premier is a tandem quadrupole instrument that is designed to deliver a higher level of speed sensitivity and reliability in a more compact configuration the lct premier is a lc electrospraytof instrument designed to deliver a higher level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise quantitative analysis 

  in 2004 the company introduced a new qtof configuration mass spectrometry system the qtof premier tm to replace its qtof ultima line of systems and offer a new level of instrument performance to its customers the qtof premier is a tandem mass spectrometry system developed to provide increased levels of sensitivity and specificity to customers involved in challenging analyses such as those often encountered in proteomics and metabolite profiling experiments the company began shipping the qtof premier in the fourth quarter of 2004 the qtof premier is compatible and often purchased with an hplc or uplc system as an inlet a device to efficiently introduce a separated sample into the mass spectrometer 

lcms 

liquid chromatography hplc and uplc and mass spectrometry ms are instrumental technologies often embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device an increasing percentage of the company’s customers are purchasing lc and ms components simultaneously and it is becoming common for lc and ms instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and be operated by the same user the descriptions of lc and ms above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners increasingly in today’s instrument market this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both lc and ms technologies as part of a single device in response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments the company has organized its waters division to develop manufacture sell and support integrated lcms systems 

ta division 

thermal analysis 

thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials such as their physical state weight dimension and mechanical and electrical properties which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques consequently thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development production and characteriza 

6 tion of materials in various industries such as plastics chemicals automobiles pharmaceuticals and electronics 

  rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or conditions the information obtained under such conditions provides insight to a material’s behavior during manufacturing transport usage and storage 

  thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and in many cases provide information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial consumer goods and health care products as with hplc a range of instrumentation is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation in addition systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications for example the qseries tm family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a variety of sample cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials in 2002 ta introduced a new dynamic mechanical analyzer “dma” the q800 tm dma in 2003 ta introduced two new dma’s the q400 tm dma and the q600 tm dma additionally in the first quarter of 2003 ta expanded its rheometry product line through the acquisition of rheometrics scientific inc “rheometrics” during 2003 the rheometrics product line was successfully integrated within the ta instruments division 

  the company sells supports and services these product offerings through ta headquartered in new castle delaware the ta division operates independently from the waters division though several of its overseas offices are situated in waters facilities ta has dedicated field sales and service operations and service revenue primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from billed labor expenses associated with the repair maintenance and upgrade of installed systems 

customers 

the company has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts other industrial accounts universities and government agencies the pharmaceutical segment represents the company’s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies generic drug manufacturers and biotechnology companies the company’s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers polymer manufacturers food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories the company also sells to various universities and government agencies worldwide the company’s technical support staff works closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements 

  the company does not rely on any single customer or one group of customers for a material portion of its sales during fiscal years 2004 and 2003 no single customer accounted for more than 3 of the company’s net sales 

sales and service 

the company has one of the largest sales and service organizations in the industry focused exclusively on lc ms and thermal analysis markets across these technologies using respective specialized sales and service forces the company serves its customer base with approximately 1990 field representatives in 89 sales offices throughout the world as of december 31 2004 compared to approximately 1890 field representatives in 97 sales offices as of december 31 2003 the sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships while service representatives work in the field to install instruments and minimize instrument downtime for customers technical support representatives work directly with customers helping them to develop applications and procedures the company provides customers with comprehensive product literature and also makes consumable products available through a dedicated catalog 

7 manufacturing 

the company provides high quality lc products by controlling each stage of production of its instruments and columns the company assembles most of its lc instruments at its facility in milford massachusetts where it performs machining wiring assembly and testing the milford facility employs manufacturing techniques that are expected to meet the strict iso 9002 quality manufacturing standards and fda mandated good manufacturing practices the company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic components such as computers monitors and circuit boards to outside vendors that can meet the company’s quality requirements 

  the company manufactures its lc columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland where it processes sizes and treats silica and polymer media that are packed into columns solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping containers the wexford facility also manufactures and distributes certain data instruments and software components for the company’s lc ms and thermal analysis product lines these facilities meet the same iso and fda standards met by the milford massachusetts facility and are approved by the fda 

  the company manufactures most of its ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland certain components or modules of the company’s ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors each stage of this supply chain is closely monitored by the company to maintain its high quality and performance standards the instruments components or modules are then returned to the company’s facilities where its engineers perform final assembly calibrations to customer specifications and quality control procedures the company’s ms facilities meet similar iso and fda standards met by the milford massachusetts facility and are approved by the fda 

  thermal analysis products are manufactured at the company’s new castle delaware facility and rheometry products are manufactured at the company’s new castle delaware and crawley england facilities similar to ms certain elements of ta’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and are then returned to the company’s facilities for final assembly calibration and quality control the company’s thermal analysis facilities meet similar iso standards met by the milford massachusetts facility 

research and development 

the company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products which both complement and update the existing product offering the company’s research and development expenditures for 2004 2003 and 2002 were 652 million 592 million and 519 million respectively nearly all of the current lc products of the company have been developed at the company’s main research and development center located in milford massachusetts with input and feedback from the company’s extensive field organizations the majority of the ms products have been developed at facilities in england and nearly all of the current thermal analysis products have been developed at the company’s research and development center in new castle delaware at december 31 2004 there were approximately 525 employees involved in the company’s research and development efforts the company has increased research and development expenses relating to acquisitions and the company’s continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements despite the company’s active research and development programs there can be no assurances that the company’s product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the company will be accepted by the marketplace 

employees 

the company employed approximately 4200 employees with 49 located in the united states and 3900 employees with 48 located in the united states at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase of 8 over 2003 is primarily due to the acquisition of nugenesis and increases in service personnel in support of the company’s growing installed base of instrument systems the company considers its employee relations in general to be good and the company’s employees are not represented by any unions the company believes that its future success depends in a large part upon its continued ability to attract and 

8 retain highly skilled employees during 2004 the company announced and commenced a small restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various support functions and field sales and service organizations around the world the employment of approximately 70 people was terminated as a result of this restructuring all of whom had left the company as of december 31 2004 

competition 

the analytical instrument and systems market is highly competitive the company encounters competition from several worldwide instrument manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies the company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of instrument performance reliability and service and to a lesser extent price some competitors have instrument businesses that are more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets some competitors have greater financial and other resources than the company 

  in the markets served by hplc uplc ms and lcms the company’s principal competitors include applied biosystems inc agilent technologies inc thermo electron corporation varian inc shimadzu corporation and bruker biosciences corporation in the markets served by ta the company’s principal competitors include perkinelmer inc mettlertoledo international inc shimadzu corporation haake and parrphysica the company is not aware of a competitor offering a uplc system comparable to its acquity instrument 

  the market for consumable hplc products including separation columns is also highly competitive but is more fragmented than the analytical instruments market the company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized companies that pack and distribute columns the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica packs columns and distributes its own product the company competes in this market on the basis of reproducibility reputation and performance and to a lesser extent price the company’s principal competitors for consumable products include phenomenex supelco inc agilent technologies inc alltech international holdings inc and merck and co inc the acquity instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with uplc columns to effect the chemical separation uplc columns are both fluidically and electronically connected to the acquity instrument to allow users to simultaneously employ and track the performance status of the uplc column the company believes that the expansion of uplc technology will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between uplc and the acquity uplc instrument

risk factors 

competition and the analytical instrument market 

the analytical instrument market and in particular the portion related to the company’s hplc uplc ms lcms thermal analysis and rheometry product lines is highly competitive and the company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both 

10 domestic and foreign markets some competitors have instrument businesses that are more diversified than the company’s business but are typically less focused on the company’s chosen markets there can be no assurances that the company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the company or that the company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions there can be no assurances that the company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future 

  additionally the market may from time to time experience low sales growth approximately 53 of the company’s net sales in 2004 were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

risk of disruption 

the company manufactures hplc and uplc instruments at its facility in milford massachusetts separation columns at its facilities in taunton massachusetts and wexford ireland ms products at its facilities in manchester england cheshire england and wexford ireland thermal analysis products at its facility in new castle delaware and rheometry products at its facilities in new castle delaware and crawley england any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities whether due to labor difficulties destruction of or damage to either facility or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

foreign operations and exchange rates 

approximately 64 of the company’s 2004 net sales were outside of the united states and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies as a result a significant portion of the company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 

  additionally the us dollar value of the company’s net sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

reliance on key management 

the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise none of the key management employees has an employment contract with the company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the company if for any reason such key personnel do not continue to be active in management the company’s operations could be adversely affected 

protection of intellectual property 

the company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable however there can be no assurances that any patents held by the company will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company conversely there could be successful claims against the company where its intellectual property does not cover competitor products or is invalidated the company’s patents including those licensed from others expire on various dates if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights it could have an adverse and material effect on the company’s results of operations and financial conditions 

reliance on customer demand 

the demand for the company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its hplc uplc ms thermal analysis and rheometry products the level of capital expenditures of the company’s customers the rate of economic growth in the company’s major markets and competitive considerations there can be no assurances that the company’s results of operations will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above 

 most of the raw materials components and supplies purchased by the company are available from a number of different suppliers however a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the company the company believes alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and accordingly adversely affect the company’s business 

 certain components or modules of the company’s ms instruments are manufactured by longstanding outside contractors disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the company the company believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these components or modules but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations

with respect to the waters division’s performance by product line excluding the effects of currency translation lc sales liquid chromatography — including hplc and uplc product lines grew approxi 

16 mately 9 the growth in lc instrument sales in 2004 was 7 this growth was due principally to the introduction of new products such as the acquity uplc instrument and steady demand for existing instruments in 2004 the sales of lc consumables sample preparation devices in the company’s chemistry operations grew 10 primarily as a result of continued strength in demand related to pharmaceutical production and the introduction of new chromatography columns most notably the sunfire tm product line lc service sales grew 13 over 2003 due to increased sales of service plans to the company’s growing installed base of customers for the lc business service revenue was approximately 28 of total lc revenue in 2004 the growth of lc service revenue was geographically broadbased and was driven by increased demand primarily from large multinational customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased waters instruments lc consumables account for approximately 19 of overall lc sales 

  ms sales grew approximately 6 in 2004 excluding the effects of currency translation the increase in sales over 2003 is primarily a result of strong growth of tandem quadrupole instruments throughout the year and the positive impact of new product shipments especially the qtof premier late in the year the growth in 2004 is also a result of weak 2003 ms performance during which ms sales declined 18 over the prior year due primarily to the effects of a patent litigation loss sustained in 2002 during 2004 the company reentered all instrument categories impacted by the patent litigation loss service revenue for the ms product line accounted for approximately 19 of total ms revenue in 2004 and 2003 and grew approximately 12 in 2004 due to increased sales of service plans to the company’s growing installed base of customers

  geographically waters lc and ms sales in asia had the highest growth in 2004 growth in asia was highlighted by business associated with growth of the pharmaceutical industry in india and more broadbased growth in china more regulations for food and drinking water testing contributed to sales growth in japan and in southeast asia in asia and in japan the company’s growth rates in sales excluding the effects of currency translation were 27 and 14 respectively sales in the us grew 12 while europe experienced a modest 1 increase in sales due to slower sales volume in the first half of the year 

ta instruments division net sales 

sales for thermal analysis instruments rheometry instruments and related service revenues grew 11 in 2004 excluding the effects of currency translation the growth of this business was influenced by strong sales growth of 16 outside of the us primarily from europe and asia as a result of expanded sales and marketing efforts in the regions sales in the us grew 5 in 2004 and 2003 service revenue was approximately 26 of overall revenue and grew approximately 10 in 2004 primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments 

gross profit

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses were 652 million for 2004 and 592 million for 2003 an increase of 60 million or 10 the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to laboratory informatics acquisitions the effects of foreign currency translation and to the company’s continued commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and improved lc ms thermal analysis and rheometry products 

purchased intangibles amortization

expensed inprocess research and development 

in 2003 in connection with the acquisition of creon the company wrote off the fair value of purchased inprocess research and development “iprd” of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of 60 million the amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses as of the creon acquisition date the “acquisition date” there were four projects that met the above criteria the 

19 significant iprd projects identified consist of the elab notebook and the automatic lcms dereplication system the iprd charges associated with these projects were 45 million and 08 million respectively 

  management determined the valuation of the iprd using a number of factors including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of the projects ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects iii whether the projects had an alternative future use and iv the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 

  the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality as of the acquisition date none of the iprd projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality in assessing the technological feasibility of a project consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome 

  future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management’s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management’s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion the discount rates include a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized the cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from 55 to 60 per annum depending on the project’s stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed this discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased iprd resulted in a total valuation of 60 million although work on the projects related to the iprd continued after the acquisition the amount of the purchase price allocated to iprd was written off because the projects underlying the iprd that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date as of december 31 2004 the iprd automatic lcms dereplication system project still had not reached technological feasibility the expected remaining cost to complete this project is not considered material to the company and there are currently no expected material variations between projected results from the projects versus those at the time of the acquisition the company expects the project to be completed within the next twelve months 

other income expense net 

in 2004 and 2003 the company recorded 10 million and 03 million respectively of pretax charges for otherthantemporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments note 5 the 2004 pretax charge of 10 million is for the company’s remaining investment carrying value of geneprot this charge was recorded based on the company’s current assessment of geneprot’s financial condition 

interest expense 

interest expense was 101 million and 24 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in 2004 interest expense is primarily attributed to the additional borrowings in the us to fund the stock repurchase programs note 10 

interest income

revenue recognition 

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets once the product is shipped all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order the company’s products generally carry one year of warranty these costs are accrued at the point of shipment once the warranty period has expired the customer may purchase a service contract service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straightline basis over the contract term at december 31 2004 the company had current and longterm deferred revenue liabilities of approximately 668 million and 73 million respectively

27 when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors including hourly service billing rates estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort

valuation of equity investments

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely the company must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

  the company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options the corresponding credit was to additional paidincapital because of the outstanding stock options the company believes that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will not be realized therefore a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to us income in the future event there is us taxable income the valuation allowance would be reversed and deferred tax assets recorded with a corresponding credit to additional paidincapital 

litigation 

as described in item 3 of part i of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

  with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading “hewlettpackard company” as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

29 pension and other postretirement benefits 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 800 

  at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits and changes as longterm interest rates change at yearend 2004 the company determined this rate to be 575 postretirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company’s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions”

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets” which amends accounting principles board opinion no 29 this standard requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 and should be applied prospectively at the present time the company does not believe that adoption of sfas 153 will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

30 the maximum was repatriated the company estimates an increase in the income tax provision of between 200 million and 450 million depending on the final technical clarifications 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines further information regarding the company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in notes 2 and 10 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to certain intercompany balances forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in euro japanese yen and british pound the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances in addition the company utilizes derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 

  the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates the company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate at times to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

cash flow hedges 

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 

  during the first quarter of 2004 the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of 1250 million to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt with a maturity date of 21 months the company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 with a realized gain of 16 million the total pretax amount of the gain that was reclassified to earnings in 2004 was 07 million the remaining 09 million will be reclassified to earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap as of december 31 2004 the company had no outstanding cash flow hedges 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world with approximately 31 of its sales denominated in euros 11 in yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations any increase or decrease in the fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company’s consolidated foreign affiliates therefore these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 

  during 2004 the company hedged its net investment in yen foreign affiliates with crosscurrency interest rate swaps with notional values ranging from approximately 250 million to approximately 370 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 the notional amounts of outstanding contracts were approximately 370 million and 250 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 24 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consisted of realized losses 

31 of 16 million relating to closed crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of 08 million relating to the japanese yen crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 16 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consisted of realized gains of 13 million and unrealized gains of 03 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consisted of realized losses of 14 million and unrealized gains of 04 million 

  during 2004 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded a cumulative net pretax gain of 07 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which consisted of realized gains of 05 million related to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of 02 million related to the british pound forward agreements as of december 31 2004 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds with a notional amount of approximately 450 million british pounds outstanding for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recorded realized losses of 33 million in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds that were entered into and closed in 2003 as of december 31 2003 the company had no open forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded unrealized gains of 03 million in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds 

  during 2004 the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in british pounds under the terms of the agreement the company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell british pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy british pounds with option premiums that offset for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recorded a realized cumulative net pretax loss of 86 million to accumulated other comprehensive income related to the closed range forward agreements as of december 31 2004 the company had no open range forward agreements in british pounds 

  assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar the fair market value of the crosscurrency interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts agreements designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operations as of december 31 2004 would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 123 million 

other 

the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies include the euro japanese yen and british pound the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 629 million and 320 million respectively 

  assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar the fair market value of the forward contracts designated as fair value hedges as of december 31 2004 would decrease earnings by approximately 63 million 

  the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less in repurchase agreements and money market funds cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value the company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits

 item 1 business general waters corporation “waters” or the “company” an analytical instrument manufacturer designs manufactures and sells through its waters division high performance liquid chromatography “hplc” and mass spectrometry “ms” instrument systems and associated service and support products including chromatography columns and other “consumable” products through its ta instruments division “tai” the company designs manufactures services and sells thermal analysis and rheology instruments the company is also a developer and supplier of software based products which interface with the company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system   the company’s products are used by pharmaceutical life science biochemical industrial academic and government customers working in research and development quality assurance and other laboratory applications the company’s hplc instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full range of compounds ms instruments are used in drug discovery and development including clinical trial testing the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as “proteomics” and environmental testing the company’s thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous liquids for uses in various industrial consumer goods and health care products   waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of waters technologies corporation its operating subsidiary the company previously operated as the waters chromatography division of millipore corporation prior to a management buyout of the division that became effective on august 18 1994 waters became a publicly traded company with its initial public offering “ipo” in november 1995 since the ipo the company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of micromass limited “micromass” in september 1997 and tai in may 1996 business segments as indicated above the company operates in the analytical instruments industry manufacturing and distributing products in three complementary technologies hplc ms and thermal analysis in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 the company completed the integration of the micromass field sales service distribution and manufacturing organizations into the waters division and changed the internal reporting structure to reflect this integration as a result the company has two operating segments waters division and tai which have similar economic characteristics product processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments because of these similarities the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes waters division hplc developed in the 1950’s hplc is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications   the most significant enduse markets for hplc are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries in these markets hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs to develop manufacturing methods and to assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is also used in a variety of other applications such as the identification of food content for nutritional labeling in the food and beverage industry the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry as well as applications in 2 other industries such as chemical and consumer products hplc is also used by universities research institutions and government agencies and in many instances the united states food and drug administration “fda” and the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and their international counterparts mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

  a complete hplc system consists of five basic components solvent delivery system sample injector separation column detector and data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow the chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system then records and stores the information from the detector   the primary “consumable products” for hplc are chromatography columns these columns are packed with separation media used in the hplc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the chromatography column contains one of several types of packing typically stationary phase particles made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components   waters columns can be used on watersbranded as well as its competitors’ hplc systems the company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica packs columns and distributes its own products in doing so the company believes it can better ensure product consistency a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and react quickly to new customer requirements   during 2002 and 2003 the company experienced growth in its hplc chromatography column and sample preparation businesses especially in the newly introduced xterra tm and atlantis tm columns as well as in oasis tm sample preparation cartridges   based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors the company believes that it is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of hplc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related services the company also believes that it has the leading hplc market share in the united states europe and nonjapan asia and believes it has a leading market share position in japan   waters manufactures hplc instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation from breeze tm systems for academic research applications to fully automated alliance tm 2795 systems for high speed screening and with a variety of detection technologies from uv absorbance to ms optimized for certain analyses in 2003 the company introduced new application tailored hplc systems for the analysis of biologics as well as a new hplc detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of hplc to compounds that are not amenable to uv absorbance detection   the servicing and support of hplc instruments and accessories is an important source of revenue for the waters division these revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans demand service customer training and performance validation services support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance a commitment to supply software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly repair a nonfunctioning instrument in return for a fee described in a one or two year contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument   in the third quarter of 2003 waters expanded its data management product lines through the acquisition of creon lab control ag “creon” the new software products available for sale by the waters division as a result of this acquisition expand the range of the company’s information management offerings the company’s existing server based software products millenium and empower are now completed by the addition of creon’s internet or “web” based software that enables the reporting of scientific data sourced from a broader array of instruments 3 mass spectrometry mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions   the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacturing sale and distribution of ms instruments these instruments can be integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such as hplc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography gas chromatography and elemental analysis systems a wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of ms instrumentation including devices that incorporate quadrupole ion trap time of flight “tof” and classical magnetic sector technologies furthermore these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments   currently the company offers and provides service support and training for a wide range of ms instruments utilizing various combinations of quadrupole tof and magnetic sector designs these instruments are used in drug discovery and development as well as for environmental testing the majority of mass spectrometers sold by waters are designed to utilize an hplc system as the sample introduction device these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical and environmental markets worldwide service revenues are primarily related to the sale of parts and with billed labor associated with instrument repair and routine maintenance   the mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection device for hplc the company’s smaller sized mass spectrometers such as the single quadrupole zq tm and waters emd tm  are often referred to as hplc “detectors” and are either sold as part of an hplc system or as an hplc upgrade tandem quadrupole systems such as the waters quattro micro tm and quattro ultima tm instruments are used primarily for experiments performed for late stage drug development including clinical trial testing and qtof instruments such as the company’s qtof micro tm and qtof ultima tm instruments are typically used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics” the majority of mass spectrometers sold by the company are designed to use an hplc system as the sample introduction device   in 2003 the company introduced two new mass spectrometry systems the quattro premier tm and the lct premier tm  the quattro premier tm is a new tandem quadrupole instrument that is designed to deliver a higher level of speed sensitivity and reliability in a more compact configuration the lct premier tm is a qtof instrument designed to deliver a new level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise quantitative analysis tai thermal analysis thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials such as their physical state weight dimension and mechanical and electrical properties which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques consequently thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development production and characterization of materials in various industries such as plastics chemicals automobiles pharmaceuticals and electronics   rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials rheology characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or conditions the information obtained under such conditions provides insight to a material’s behavior during manufacturing transport usage and storage   the company sells supports and services these products offering through tai headquartered in new castle delaware this division operates independently from the waters division though several of its overseas offices are situated in waters facilities tai has dedicated field sales and service operations and service 4 revenue primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from billed labor expenses associated with the repair maintenance and upgrade of installed systems

business 

  

waters an analytical instrument manufacturer is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of hplc instruments chromatography columns and other consumables and related service the company believes it has the largest hplc market share in the united states europe and nonjapan asia and believes it has a leading position in japan hplc the largest product segment of the analytical instrument market is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect identify monitor and measure the chemical physical and biological composition of materials and to purify a full range of compounds through micromass the company believes it is a market leader in the development manufacture and distribution of mass spectrometry instruments which are complementary products that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments especially hplc through tai the company believes it is also the world’s leader in thermal analysis a prevalent and complementary technique used in the analysis of polymers 

  

developed in the 1950’s hplc today is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and materials hplc’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify 80 of all known chemicals and materials as a result hplc is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes quality control and process engineering applications within the pharmaceutical and life science industries its most significant enduse market hplc is used extensively to identify new drugs to develop manufacturing methods and to assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals hplc is used to identify food content for nutritional labeling in the food and beverages industry and to test water and air purity within the environmental testing industry hplc is also used in a variety of applications in other industries such as chemical and consumer products as well as by universities and government agencies in many instances the food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency regulations and those of their international counterparts mandate testing that requires hplc instrumentation 

  

  

waters manufactures over 100 hplc instrument types a complete hplc system consists of five basic components the solvent delivery system the sample injector the separation column the detector and the data acquisition unit the solvent delivery system pumps the solvent through the hplc system while the sample injector injects the sample into the solvent flow the separation column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by the detector which measures the presence and amount of the constituents the data acquisition unit then records and stores the information from the detector consumable products primarily are columns packed with separation media used in the hplc testing process and are replaced at regular intervals the separation column contains one of several types of packing typically stationary phase packing made from silica as the sample flows through the column it is separated into its constituent components 

  

the acquisition of micromass expanded the company’s product offerings in mass spectrometry instruments the company’s mass spectrometry line is a world leader in the development manufacture sale and support of organic inorganic stable isotope and inductivelycoupled plasma “icp” mass spectrometers typically combined with hplc chemical electrophoresis chemical electrophoresis chromatography gas chromatography or elemental analysis systems mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions these products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science pharmaceutical biomedical clinical environmental and geochemistry markets worldwide with the acquisition of micromass waters became one of the leading worldwide manufacturers of analytical systems that bring together hplc and mass spectrometry detection or hplcms design innovations in hplcms interfacing technology have drastically improved the operating efficiencies of these systems greatly simplifying their operation driving down their overall cost and making them much more affordable for the average analytical laboratory these laboratories previously relied on expert mass spectrometrists to provide them the information they now get in minutes the largest market for hplcms is the pharmaceutical market where new drug development technologies are placing greater demands on laboratories to screen and analyze new drug compounds 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company combined the field sales service and distribution organizations of it hplc and micromass operations the purpose of this integration was to enhance customer service capabilities and eliminate redundant functions 

  

the acquisition of tai expanded the company’s product offerings to include thermal analysis and rheology products tai develops manufactures sells and services thermal analysis and rheology instruments which are used for the physical characterization of polymers and related materials thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials such as their physical state weight dimension and mechanical and electrical properties which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques consequently thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development production and characterization of materials in various industries such as plastics chemicals automobiles pharmaceuticals and electronics rheology instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials rheology characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity elasticity and deformation under different types of loading the information obtained provides insight with regard to a material’s behavior during manufacture transport usage and storage 

  

instruments and data products comprise approximately two thirds of the company’s total revenue consumable products and service comprise the remaining amount of the company’s total revenue

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

financial overview 

  

sales grew by 4 in 2002 and by 8 in 2001 excluding currency effects sales grew 2 in 2002 and 11 in 2001 sales growth before currency effects in both years reflected increased customer demand for new products sales growth in 2002 was adversely impacted by the effect of ongoing patent litigation in the us as discussed below as a result of this litigation sales in the us were down 5 while sales growth elsewhere was generally broadbased geographically reported operating income for 2002 and 2001 was 1964 million and 1495 million respectively operating income excluding provisions for litigation of 79 million an impairment charge of 24 million and restructuring and other unusual charges of 74 million for 2002 was 2142 million a 5 decrease from the 2245 million excluding provisions for litigation of 750 million generated in 2001 the company remained essentially debtfree while generating allin cash flow of 849 million allin cash flow is the increase of cash including changes in restricted cash plus the reduction of debt in february 2002 the company entered into an agreement to replace its existing credit facility the new credit facility provides a 2500 million line of credit and is unsecured 

  

in march 2002 the company was informed as a result of a jury’s finding on a civil action filed by competitors that the quattro ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer sold in the us infringes on their us patent the jury has determined damages in the amount of 475 million in march 2003 the infringement in the us was affirmed on appeal including damages and interest of approximately 540 million similar claims have been asserted against the company in other countries and there is a possibility that claims may be made with respect to other products in the mass spectrometry line the company recorded a 750 million patent litigation charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this matter including interest court costs legal fees and other charges an additional provision of 28 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2002 relating to current year sales the amounts recorded represent the company’s best estimate of its exposure based on information currently available 

  

during 2002 approximately 62 of the company’s combined net sales were derived from operations outside the united states the company believes that the geographic diversity of its sales reduces its dependence on any particular region the us dollar value of these revenues varies with currency exchange fluctuations and such fluctuations can affect the company’s results from period to period 

  

year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001 

  

net sales

gross profit 

  

gross profit for 2002 was 5165 million compared to 4973 million for 2001 an increase of 192 million or 4 gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 580 in 2002 from 579 in 2001 these gross profit amounts and gross profit percentages reflect a reclassification of certain labor and related costs associated with service revenues that were previously classified in operating expenses and included in selling general and administrative expenses the company experienced a higher mix of sales of more profitable consumables and services in 2002 as well as reductions in hplc manufacturing costs due to lower material costs in addition the company acquired the businesses of its irish and korean distributors in early 2002 and mid 2001 respectively as such the incremental profit from direct billings have increased gross profit and gross profit percentages in 2002 as well as operating expenses the company experienced an increase in service labor costs offsetting some of the abovementioned increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for 2002 and 2001 were 2468 million and 2190 million respectively as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to 277 for 2002 from 255 for 2001 after considering the reclassification of certain labor and related costs discussed above the 278 million or 13 increase primarily resulted from increased headcount and related costs required to support anticipated increased current and future sales levels including the acquisitions of irish and korean distributor businesses headcount rose from 2133 at december 31 2001 to 2230 at december 31 2002 or 5 in addition the company recorded an increase of approximately 25 million in patent defense costs during 2002 the company changed its method of accounting for legal costs associated with litigating patents effective january 1 2002 and current year patent related expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses the company also recorded a provision of 15 million for estimated damages incurred with respect to ongoing patent infringement litigation during 2002 expenses also slightly increased due to the effects of currency translation foreign currency transaction gains and losses were negligible in fiscal year 2002 

  

research and development expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 519 million for 2002 and 466 million for 2001 an increase of 53 million or 11 the company continued to invest significantly in the development of new and improved hplc mass spectrometry thermal analysis and rheology products 

  

goodwill and purchased technology amortization 

  

goodwill and purchased technology amortization for 2002 was 36 million compared to 71 million for 2001 a decrease of 35 million or 50 the change was primarily related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 in accordance with recently adopted accounting standards

the company recorded 74 million of charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 for restructuring and other specific incremental charges relating to its integration of the worldwide sales service and distribution groups of the micromass division with the waters hplc division the charges in 2002 include severance costs for 42 people cancellation penalties for distributor contracts facility closure costs and other specific incremental costs related to this integration the objective of this strategy is to leverage the strengths of both divisions and align operating expenses to a more rational level as a percentage of sales there was no such charge in 2001 

  

the following table provides additional information about the 2002 restructuring and other unusual charges 

  

   

  

  

operating income 

  

operating income for 2002 was 1964 million compared to 1495 million for 2001 this increase of 469 million or 31 for the year is primarily attributed to the decrease in litigation provisions from 750 million to 79 million an increase in sales and the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 offsetting the increase in operating income is an increase in operating expenses including 74 million for restructuring and other unusual charges associated with the integration of the worldwide sales service and distribution groups of the micromass division with the waters hplc division and a 24 million charge of an otherthantemporary impairment of a longlived asset operating expenses grew faster than sales as the company has yet to realize the full benefits of the combination of the micromass and hplc field operations 

  

other income expense net 

  

in 2002 the company recorded 137 million in pretax charges for otherthantemporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments including investments in geneprot and variagenics the impairment charges were offset by a 77 million termination fee received from geneprot for cancellation of its 200 million order in 2001 the company recorded a 71 million pretax charge for an otherthantemporary impairment to the carrying amount of certain equity investments primarily its investment in variagenics 

  

interest income expense net 

  

net interest income for 2002 and 2001 was 50 million for both years the company experienced an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances in 2002 offset by an increase in interest expense due to accrued postjudgment interest associated with the applera patent litigation 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the company’s effective income tax rate was 221 in 2002 and 223 in 2001 the 2002 tax rate decreased primarily due to the continued favorable shift in the mix of taxable income to lower tax rate jurisdictions 

  

income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

  

income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change for 2002 and 2001 was 1522 million and 1145 million respectively resulting in an increase of 377 million or 33 the increase is primarily due to the decrease in litigation provisions from 750 million to 79 million an increase in sales and the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 offsetting this increase is an increase in operating expenses including 74 million for restructuring and other unusual charges associated with the integration of the worldwide sales service and distribution groups of the micromass division with the waters hplc division and a 24 million charge of an otherthantemporary impairment of a longlived asset operating expenses grew faster than sales as the company has yet to realize the full benefits of the combination of the micromass and hplc field operations 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

  

in 2002 the method of accounting for patent related costs associated with patent litigation was changed effective january 1 2002 from a method of capitalizing the patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated remaining economic life to expensing the costs as incurred the company believes that this change is preferable because it will provide a better comparison with the company’s industry peers the majority of which expense these costs as incurred the 45 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years after reduction for income taxes of 13 million is included as a charge to net income for 2002 

  

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2000 

  

net sales 

  

net sales for 2001 were 8592 million and were an increase of 8 compared to 7951 million for 2000 excluding the adverse effects of a stronger us dollar in 2001 particularly with the euro and the japanese yen 2001 net sales increased by 11 over 2000 overall orders and sales reflected continued strong demand across all major geographies especially from life science customers hplc and ms sales in 2001 grew slightly more than 10 in constant currencies over 2000 while ta sales were flat order backlog remained unchanged for the year sales of highend mass spectrometry products were strong for 2001 in all of the company’s life science applications 

  

gross profit 

  

gross profit for 2001 was 4973 million compared to 4641 million for 2000 an increase of 332 million or 7 gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 579 in 2001 from 584 in 2000 these gross profit amounts and gross profit percentages reflect a reclassification of certain labor and related costs associated with service revenues that were previously 

  

classified in operating expenses and included in selling general and administrative expenses the decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily due an increase in service labor costs and to some extent the adverse effects of currency translation to the company’s sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was offset by productivity improvements realized from volume growth and cost savings efficiencies and a modest shift in sales mix toward higher margin chemistry and service product lines 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for 2001 and 2000 were 2190 million and 2037 million respectively as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 255 for 2001 from 256 for 2000 after considering the reclassification of certain labor and related costs discussed above the 153 million or 8 increase in 2001 resulted primarily from increased headcount particularly in aftersales technical support within the company’s mass spectrometry business headcount rose from 1895 at december 31 2000 to 2133 at december 31 2001 or 13 this increase in headcount and related costs were required to support increased current and future sales levels and were slightly reduced by the effects of currency translation foreign currency transaction gains and losses were negligible in fiscal year 2001 

  

research and development expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 466 million for 2001 and 425 million for 2000 an increase of 41 million or 10 the company continued to invest significantly in the development of new and improved hplc mass spectrometry thermal analysis and rheology products 

  

goodwill and purchased technology amortization 

  

goodwill and purchased technology amortization was 71 million for both 2001 and 2000 as there was relatively no change in the nature or amortization periods of the asset components in 2002 goodwill amortization ceased in accordance with recently issued accounting standards goodwill amortization was approximately 40 million in 2001 

  

litigation provisions 

  

in 2001 the company recorded a 750 million pretax charge for patent litigation as more fully described in note 9 of the financial statements there was no such charge in 2000 

  

operating income 

  

operating income for 2001 excluding a provision for patent litigation was 2245 million compared to 2108 million for 2000 this increase of 137 million or 6 for the year is attributed to production efficiencies and continued focus on cost controls in all operating areas operating income as a percentage of sales decreased slightly from 265 in 2000 to 261 in 2001 essentially due to marginal increases in operating expenses in relation to sales growth unfavorably impacted by currency translation 

  

other income expense net 

  

in 2001 the company recorded a 71 million pretax charge for an otherthantemporary impairment to the carrying amount of certain equity investments there was no such charge in 2000 

  

interest income expense net 

  

net interest income for 2001 and 2000 was 50 million and 01 million respectively the change primarily reflected the elimination of debt under the company’s bank credit agreement during 2000 and interest earned on investments of cash generated from the company’s positive cash flow offset slightly by lower yields 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the company’s effective income tax rate was 223 in 2001 and 26 in 2000 the 2001 tax rate decreased primarily due to the continued favorable shift in the mix of taxable income to lower tax rate jurisdictions and tax benefits provided by the provision for patent litigation 

  

income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

  

net income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change for 2001 and 2000 was 1145 million and 1561 million respectively resulting in a decrease of 416 million or 27 the decrease was primarily due to a 750 million pretax charge against income in 2001 for patent litigation and to a certain extent the unfavorable impact of currency translation offset by sales growth favorable interest income dynamics and the impact of a decrease in the company’s effective income tax rate 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

during 2002 net cash provided by the company’s operating activities was 2196 million primarily as a result of net income for the year of 1477 million after adding back depreciation of 260 million amortization of intangible assets of 112 million and noncash impairment charges of 161 million the 2196 million is an increase of 304 million over 2001 and is primarily due to the increase in the company’s net income working capital for 2002 was 3162 million relatively flat with 2001 excluding the increase in cash 

  

in terms of working capital and after excluding the effects of currency translation 18 million was used as accounts receivable grew relatively proportionate to sales growth dayssalesoutstanding stood at 70 days at december 31 2002 compared to 67 days at december 31 2001 with the increase mainly attributed to the effects of currency translation approximately 46 million was used for inventory growth related to current sales expectations within liabilities an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities and deferred revenue and customer advances provided 64 million in addition from financing activities the company received 113 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and its employee stock purchase plan 

  

primary uses of cash flow during the year were 993 million for the purchase of treasury shares 204 million for investments in unaffiliated companies and business acquisitions and 380 million of property plant and equipment and software capitalization investments approximately 499 million of cash was reclassed to restricted cash during the period in connection with the standby letter of credit issued by the company with respect to the unfavorable judgment in the applera patent litigation in march 2003 the unfavorable judgment was upheld in appeals court the company is expected to pay approximately 540 million in damages including interest in the second quarter of 2003 cash held as restricted will no longer be required once payment has been made 

  

the company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalent balance of 2633 million and expected cash flow from operating activities together with borrowings available from its credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital capital spending requirements and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation in the foreseeable future it is the company’s intention to continue to purchase the remaining 1007 million in treasury shares available under its stock repurchase program during the first half of 2003 because the repurchases are made in the us only the company may have borrowings against its credit facility in 2003 

  

commitments 

  

the company paid 193 million in the first quarter of 2003 for acquisitions the company also has various ongoing license and collaboration agreements in conjunction with its research and development efforts capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to be similar to 2002 levels the company has commitments for lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2019 covering certain buildings office equipment and automobiles future minimum rents payable as of december 31 2002 under noncancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year are 138 million 119 million 88 million and 54 million for the years 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively future minimum rents payable from 2007 through 2019 are 216 million 

  

the company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties including but not limited to product technical obsolescence regulatory compliance protection of intellectual property rights changes in pharmaceutical industry spending competitive advantages current and pending litigation and changes in foreign exchanges rates that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the company’s existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility the company also believes there are no provisions in the new credit facility its real estate leases and supplier and collaborative agreements that would accelerate payments require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical transactions as a publicly held company the company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

summary 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis waters evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition product returns and allowances bad debts inventory valuation equity investments goodwill and intangible assets income taxes warranty and installation provisions contingencies and litigation waters bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service respectively partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets once the product is shipped all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order the company’s products generally carry one year of warranty these costs are accrued at the point of shipment once the warranty period has expired the customer may purchase a service contract service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straightline basis over the contract term at december 31 2002 the company had a deferred revenue liability of 521 million 

  

product shipments including those for demonstration or evaluation and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue related to installation of certain products is deferred when the product is shipped and recognized when installation is complete the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred and recognized under a multiple element arrangement in accordance with sab 101 the company changed its method of revenue recognition for products requiring installation effective january 1 2000 previously the company recognized revenue related to both the sale and the installation of certain products at the time of shipment and accrued all associated costs estimates of the fair value of installation revenue deferred are based on comparable values from contracts in the same product family where installation is quoted or billed separately 

  

loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 

  

waters maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required waters does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including but not limited to past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer independent credit reports industry trends and the macroeconomic environment sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2002 was 1983 million net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of 58 million historically the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 

  

waters values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis “fifo” waters estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence historical demand projections of future demand including that in the company’s current backlog of orders and industry and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required the company’s inventory balance at december 31 2002 was 1116 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 110 million the company wrotedown inventory in 2002 by approximately 20 million to reflect decreased net realizable value for mass spectrometry inventory 

  

  

valuation of equity investments 

  

waters holds minority equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices for investments where the company is not publicly traded the company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements and progress of technological expectations the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is otherthantemporary future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2002 the company recorded a 76 million and 61 million charge respectively to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the impairment of certain equity investments at december 31 2002 the company had equity investments totaling 157 million included in other assets on the balance sheet 

  

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

  

the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company’s current business model net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 3467 million as of december 31 2002 in 2002 statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 142 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result the company ceased amortization of approximately 1635 million of goodwill as of december 31 2001 the company had recorded approximately 40 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately the same amount of amortization in 2002 in lieu of amortization the company was required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in 2002 and is required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter the company completed its initial review during the first half of 2002 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

  

warranty 

  

product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments while waters engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company’s previous estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2002 the company’s warranty liability was 96 million 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely the company must establish a valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 

  

the company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options the corresponding credit was to additional paidincapital because of the outstanding stock options the company believes that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will not be realized therefore a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to us income the remaining net deferred tax assets of 26 million at december 31 2002 relate to foreign deferred tax assets that are expected to be utilized 

  

  

litigation 

  

as described in item 3 of this form 10k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 

  

with respect to the claims referenced in item 3 management of the company to date has been able to make both of these determinations and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading “applera corporation” “hewlettpackard company” and “environmental legal proceedings” as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company’s results of operation or financial position 

  

recent accounting standards changes 

  

in december 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 148 accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure – an amendment to sfas 123 sfas 148 amends sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results sfas 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 with respect to the alternative transition methods permitted and the annual disclosures required the disclosure provisions for interim financial information is effective for all periods presented in financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 management has not yet evaluated the alternative transition methods if it were to adopt sfas 123 under this new standard however the company has complied with all current disclosure requirements 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fin 34 fin 45 requires that guarantors recognize a liability for certain types of guarantees equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance fin 45 also requires increased disclosure of guarantees including product warranty information the disclosure provisions of fin 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december 15 2002 the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december 31 2002 the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of fin 45 the company does not expect the application of fin 45 as it relates to initial recognition and measurement of an obligation to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force “eitf” has set forth in eitf issue 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring the scope of sfas 146 also includes 1 costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease 2 termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a onetime benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferredcompensation contract and 3 costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees sfas 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 early application is encouraged the company does not expect the application of sfas 146 to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to financial risk in several areas including changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments for purposes other than trading in accordance with the company’s overall risk management guidelines further information regarding the company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in notes 2 and 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

foreign exchange 

  

the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world as a result the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company uses debt swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts to partially mitigate such effects and these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations the debt swap agreements effectively swap higher us dollar fixed rate borrowings for lower fixed rate borrowings denominated in the respective currencies during 2002 the company opened and subsequently closed debt swap agreements in japanese yen in december 2002 the company entered into new debt swap agreements in japanese yen with notional amounts totaling 250 million with terms of three months and an interest rate of 07 for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded cumulative net pretax losses of 10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which consisted of realized losses of 14 million relating to the closed debt swap agreements and unrealized gains of 4 million relating to the new japanese yen swap agreements both of which partially offset hedged foreign exchange impacts in december 2002 the company also opened forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds with notional amounts totaling 400 million and terms of fortyfive days for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded unrealized gains of 3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2001 the company held debt swap agreements in japanese yen with notional amounts totaling 270 million with terms of three months and an interest rate of 15 for the year ended december 31 2001 the company recorded cumulative net pretax gains of 78 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which consisted of realized gains of 68 million and unrealized gains of 10 million 

  

assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in yearend exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar the fair market value of the debt swap agreements as of december 31 2002 would decrease by 25 million 

  

the company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances principal hedged currencies include the euro and british pound the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately 690 million and 541 million respectively 

  

interest rates 

  

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations when borrowing in connection with its credit agreement as a result the company may periodically attempt to minimize its interest rate exposures by using certain financial instruments such as interest swap agreements for the purposes other than trading at december 31 2002 and 2001 there were no outstanding interest swap agreements 

  

the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations the company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less in repurchase agreements and money market funds cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value the company periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits
