inclusion and diversity 

eaton is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and inclusive at all levels reflecting the diversity of our customers and communities our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the best employees without regard to race color social or economic status religion national origin marital status age veteran status sexual orientation gender identity or any protected status it is the policy of the company to make all decisions regarding employment including hiring compensation training promotions transfers or layoffs based on the principle of equal employment opportunity and without discrimination

at eaton one of our aspirational goals is to be a model of inclusion and diversity among our peers our plan to achieve this goal encompasses a number of actions including an examination into our programs practices processes and policies to look for opportunities to strengthen our support of underrepresented individuals groups and businesses across our operations 

compensation 

a key component of eaton’s attraction and retention strategy is competitive compensation eaton regularly benchmarks its compensation practices with industry peers to maintain a top performing workforce eaton’s 2021 total employee costs was 55 billion including salaries wages equitybased compensation pension and other benefits the total compensation of our median employee on october 1 2020 as reported in our 2021 proxy statement filed in march 2021 and as calculated in accordance with item 402u of regulation sk was 63951 

safety 

throughout our operations our goal is to have no safety incidents and we continue to make progress towards that goal for example in 2020 we reduced our total recordable case rate trcr by 26 040 and our days away case rate dacr by 26 017 compared to 2019 our trcr of 040 approaches our longterm goal of 025 which we believe is a worldclass safety rate 

further in 2021 the company took a number of measures to continue to protect our workforce from the covid19 pandemic including the following as appropriate 

• training our employees at sites around the world in cleaning and disinfecting protocols 

• enacting social distancing procedures staggered shifts a rotating office work schedule and modified workspace and meeting space layouts as appropriate 

• requiring employees to stay at home if they are feeling ill and encouraging increased hand washing and hygiene practices across all sites 

• advising employees to take advantage of flexible work options 

• restricting visitors to all sites 

• encouraging vaccination for all employees and at select locations arranging for vaccination clinics and transportation 

• consulting regularly with doctors and health care organizations

in the event an employee suspects they have been exposed to covid19 or testing confirms it sites will implement a response plan that includes 

• communication with all who may have been exposed 

• disinfecting work stations and common areas 

• shutting down the facility if warranted 

these actions are aligned with preventive health protocols of governmental authorities and health organizations including the centers for disease control us and the world health organization 

achieving worklife balance 

achieving worklife balance is a common concern of todays employees flexible work solutions and inclusive programs will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent and make it possible for employees in varied situations to be able to remain at eaton flexible solutions include compressed work weeks remote working job sharing parttime work flextime and telework

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

operational risks 

impacts related to and recovery from the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the global outbreak of covid19 has disrupted economic activity around the world as a result we and our employees suppliers customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities including as a result of shutdowns travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities while a substantial portion of our businesses and facilities have been classified as essential in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated we can give no assurance that there will not be additional closures in the future or that our businesses and facilities will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we have experienced and could continue to experience supply and labor shortages as the company expands its production capacity to meet increased customer demand as global economies recover the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the resurgence of covid19 as a result of new variants the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated around the globe the impact of covid19 on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to contain the impact of covid19 on public health and the global economy the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality impaired 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection additionally many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data or connects to external and internal systems because of this cybersecurity threats pose a material risk to our business operations 

global cybersecurity threats range from widespread vulnerabilities sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats or uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to itot systems these threats may be directed at eaton its products software embedded in eaton’s products or its thirdparty service providers the risk is amplified by the increasingly connected nature of our products and systems these threats may originate from anywhere in the connected world and take the form of phishing malware bots or humancentric attacks eaton continually seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats 

as a result of our worldwide operations we are subject to laws and regulations including data protectionprivacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example the global data protection regulation gdpr prefers that we manage personal data in the eu and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations 

eaton’s customers including governmental agencies are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards which may result in additional operating or production costs our cybersecurity program aligns with wellknown industrywide security control frameworks despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include theft of intellectual property disruption of operations reputational damage adverse health and safety consequences the loss or misuse of confidential information product failure as well as exposure to fines legal claims or enforcement actions 

the effects of climate change including weather disruptions and regulatorymarket reactions create uncertainties that could negatively impact our business 

global increases in greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change and there is a growing consensus that dramatic emissions reductions are needed to avoid severe climate impacts extreme weather events linked to climate change including hurricanes flooding wildfires and high heatwater scarcity create physical risks to eaton’s operating locations and supply chains while eaton is working to make its own operations carbon neutral by 2030 a global failure to achieve commitments could cause increases in these extreme weather events political instability and workforce migration ultimately increasing eaton’s cost of doing business 

regulatory reactions to climate change may pose more stringent obligations on eaton’s operations and change customer demands while eaton is already gearing its portfolio towards products that will reduce carbon and combat climate change there is a risk that eaton may not innovate quickly enough to meet changing regulatory or market demands increasing demands for metals as the world electrifies may lead to scarcity and increased costs as may uncertainty over carbon taxes and grid stability during a renewables transition despite these uncertainties we believe eaton is well positioned to capitalize on secular trends and market opportunities arising from these risks 

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns such as the spread of covid19 any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” shortages have affected the prices eatons businesses are charged as global economies recover from the covid19 pandemic if this trend continues the competitive position of our products and services may be impacted which could have a material adverse impact on operating results 

further some of eatons suppliers of component parts have increased their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts including logistics inflation should this trend continue or become more prevalent the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating results 

industry and market risks 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves 

eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitability 

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services or maintain its present market positions 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market the companys market positions may also be impacted by new entrants into eatons product or regional markets 

legal and regulatory risks 

eatons global operations subject it to economic risk as eatons results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation regulations and policies or currency fluctuations 

operating globally subjects eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation data privacy and exchange controls changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect operating results 

further existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results 

eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be affected materially by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax legislation regulations and policies the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which eaton operates if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include material unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities 

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights which could affect the companys ability to compete 

protecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies 

eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact eatons businesses 

at any given time eaton may be subject to litigation the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses financial condition or results of operations information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in note 10 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

operational risks 

the coronavirus covid19 outbreak has negatively impacted our results of operations 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic outbreak authorities have implemented measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions shelterin placeorders and shut downs and consumers have changed their demand patterns as a result our operations and financial results have been impacted the degree to which covid19 impacts our future results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality impaired 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption breach or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage further  cyberbased risks could also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products facilities or infrastructure such attacks could result in disruptions to third party systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our own or that of third parties further to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are protected configured updated and monitored all of which are typically outside our control 

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns such as the spread of covid19 any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating results 

further eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating results 

industry and market risks

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services or maintain its present market positions 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market the companys market positions may also be impacted by new entrants into eatons product or regional markets

further existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves 

eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitability 

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research   development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and   there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce   new products and services or maintain its present market positions 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market the companys market positions may also be impacted by new entrants into eatons product or regional markets 

eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growth 

eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the company a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by for example delaying eatons ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the companys operations

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk   of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which eaton operates any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption breach or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage further  cyberbased risks could also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products facilities or infrastructure such attacks could result in disruptions to third party systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our own or that of third parties further to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are protected configured updated and monitored all of which are typically outside our control 

eatons global operations subject it to economic risk as eatons   results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation   regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

operating globally subjects eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation data privacy and exchange controls changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect operating results 

further existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results 

eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax legislation regulations and policies the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which eaton operates if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and   significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase   operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons   products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating results 

further eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating results

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights   which could affect the companys ability to compete 

protecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves 

eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitability 

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research   development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and   there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce   new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

 3 

eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growth 

eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the company a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by for example delaying eatons ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the companys operations 

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk   of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which eaton operates any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

eatons global operations subject it to economic risk as eatons   results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government   regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

operating globally subjects eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect operating results 

eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws with the administration change in the united states tax reform is anticipated it is uncertain what if any impact this reform may have to eaton since proposals have not been reduced to legislative language at this time the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which eaton operates if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and   significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase   operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons   products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating results 

further eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating results 

 4 

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights   which could affect the companys ability to compete 

protecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies 

eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could   adversely impact eatons businesses 

at any given time eaton may be subject to litigation the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses financial condition or results of operations information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in note 8 and note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

legislative and regulatory action could materially adversely affect eaton 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which eaton relies or broaden the circumstances under which the company would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect its effective tax rate eaton cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the incorporation in ireland or limiting eatons ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us the company could be subject to increased taxation andor potentially significant expense 

additionally existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

eaton may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of cooper or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

eatons ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the cooper transaction will depend to a large extent on the companys ability to integrate the two businesses the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 many of these factors will be outside of eatons control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of eaton 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves 

eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets it serves and expansion of geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitability 

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research   development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and   there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce   new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

 4 

eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growth 

eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the company a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by for example delaying eatons ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the companys operations 

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk   of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which eaton operates any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

eatons global operations subject it to economic risk as eatons   results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government   regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

operating globally subjects eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect operating results 

eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which eaton operates if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and   significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase   operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons   products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating results 

further eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating results 

 5 

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights   which could affect the companys ability to compete 

protecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies 

eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could   adversely impact eatons businesses 

at any given time eaton may be subject to litigation the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses financial condition or results of operations information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

legislative and regulatory action could materially adversely affect eaton 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which eaton relies or broaden the circumstances under which the company would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect its effective tax rate andor require the company to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve its effective tax rate eaton cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the incorporation in ireland or limiting eatons ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us the company could be subject to increased taxation andor potentially significant expense

 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eatons businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves   

eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets it serves and expansion of geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitability 

eatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research   development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and   there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce   new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

table of contents 

eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growth 

eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue to be employed a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the company an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by for example delaying eatons ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the companys operations 

eatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world many   of which are located outside the united states and are subject to greater risks   of disrupted production 

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide in the last five years the companys operations outside the united states have increased significantly in relative size in comparison to its total operations the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns some of eatons nonunited states manufacturing facilities also may be more susceptible to economic and political upheaval than united states facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses 

if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost 

eaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures or computer viruses in addition security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if these information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage 

eatons substantial foreign sales subject it to economic risk as eatons   results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in local government   regulations and policies and foreign currency fluctuations 

as noted above in item 1 “foreign operations” a significant portion of eatons sales are to customers outside the united states and the company expects sales in foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total sales foreign sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect operating results 

eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

eaton is subject to income taxes in the united states and various nonunited states jurisdictions domestic and international liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions the companys effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal state and local tax authorities and by nonunited states tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and   significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase   operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons   products 

eatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating results 

further eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents 

finally while eaton carefully monitors the viability of each of its suppliers the recent global economic downturn has had an adverse impact on eatons suppliers liquidity and solvency should one or more material suppliers become insolvent eaton could be required to pay increased prices for affected raw materials or components or experience difficulty in replacing the insolvent supplier either of which could adversely affect operating results 

eaton engages in acquisitions and joint ventures and may encounter unexpected   difficulties identifying pricing or integrating those businesses 

eaton seeks to grow in part through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures which are intended to complement or expand the companys businesses and expects to continue to do so in the future the success of this strategy will depend on eatons ability to identify price finance and complete these transactions or arrangements success will also depend on the companys ability to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with the companys strategic partners in the joint ventures eaton may encounter unexpected difficulties in completing and integrating acquisitions with eatons existing operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore the company may not realize the degree or timing of benefits anticipated when it first entered into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect the companys business and operating results 

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights   which could affect the companys ability to compete 

protecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies moreover the protection provided to eatons intellectual property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may not be as advantageous as remedies available under united states law 

eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could   adversely impact eatons businesses 

at any given time eaton may be subject to litigation the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses financial condition or results of operations information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 36 

eaton participates in markets that are competitive and eatons results could be   adversely impacted by competitors actions 

eatons businesses operate in competitive markets the company competes against other global manufacturers and service providers on the basis of product performance quality and price in addition to other factors while eatons product development and quality initiatives have been competitive strengths in the past actions by eatons competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices andor a decline in the companys market share either of which could adversely affect operating results

patents and trademarks 

eaton considers its tradename and trademark to be significant value to its business as a whole the company’s products are marketed with a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses or other forms of intellectual property that expire at various dates in the future eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable based on the broad scope of the company’s product lines management believes

foreign operations 

financial information related to eaton’s foreign operations is presented in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 52 information regarding risks that may affect foreign operations is presented in item 1a of this form 10k report 




 item 1a risk factors 

among the risks that could materially adversely affect eaton’s businesses financial condition or results of operations are the following 

volatility of end markets that eaton serves 

eaton’s segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets it serves and expansion of geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect the company’s revenues operating results and profitability 

eaton’s operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services  

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eaton’s customers the company’s businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market the end result could be a negative impact on the company’s operating results 

page 4 

eaton’s operations depend on production facilities throughout the world many of which are located outside the united states and are subject to greater risks of disrupted production  

eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide in recent years the company’s operations outside the united states have increased significantly in relative size in comparison to its total operations the company’s manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster or labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns some of eaton’s nonunited states manufacturing facilities also may be more susceptible to economic and political upheaval than united states facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the company for the losses 

eaton’s substantial foreign sales subject it to economic risk as eaton’s results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in local government regulations and policies and foreign currency fluctuations 

as noted above in item 1 “foreign operations” a significant portion of eaton’s sales are to customers outside the united states and the company expects sales in foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total sales foreign sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eaton’s operating results while the company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities these risks could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses and significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eaton’s products 

eaton’s major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 “raw materials” significant shortages could affect the prices eaton’s businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

further eaton’s suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the company’s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

finally while eaton carefully monitors the viability of each of its suppliers the global economic downturn has and may continue to have an adverse impact on eaton’s suppliers’ liquidity and solvency should one or more of material suppliers become insolvent eaton could be required to pay increased prices for affected raw materials or components or experience difficulty in replacing the insolvent supplier either of which could adversely affect eaton’s results of operations 

eaton engages in acquisitions and joint ventures and may encounter unexpected difficulties identifying pricing or integrating those businesses 

eaton seeks to grow in part through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures which are intended to complement or expand the company’s businesses and expects to continue to do so in the future the success of this strategy will depend on eaton’s ability to identify price finance and complete these transactions or arrangements success will also depend on the company’s ability to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with the company’s strategic partners in the joint ventures eaton may encounter unexpected difficulties in completing and integrating acquisitions with eaton’s existing operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore the company may not realize the degree or timing of benefits eaton anticipated when it first entered into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations 

eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights which could affect the company’s ability to compete 

protecting eaton’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eaton’s competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of eaton or its business segments there can be no assurance that any one or more of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the company’s employees and into nondisclosure agreements with eaton’s suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of the company’s proprietary information these measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies moreover the protection provided to eaton’s intellectual 

page 5 

property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may not be as advantageous to eaton as the remedies available under united states law 

eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact eaton’s businesses 

at any given time eaton may be subject to litigation the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses financial condition or results of operations information regarding the company’s current legal proceedings is presented in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 36 

eaton participates in markets that are competitive and eaton’s results could be adversely impacted by competitors’ actions 

eaton’s businesses operate in competitive markets the company competes against other global manufacturers and service providers on the basis of product performance quality and price in addition to other factors while eaton’s product development and quality initiatives have been competitive strengths in the past actions by eaton’s competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices andor a decline in the company’s market share either of which could adversely affect eaton’s results
