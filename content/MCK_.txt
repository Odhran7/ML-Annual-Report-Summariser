government regulation 

mckesson generally and in many of the highly regulated industries in which it operates is subject to oversight by various federal state and local governmental entities in the us and elsewhere the company incurs significant expense and makes large investments to enable it to comply with regulations and guidance promulgated by those governmental entities a failure or alleged failure by the company to comply with statutes regulations or other laws could have a material adverse impact to the company’s business operations reputation results of operations and financial and competitive position 

controlled substances we are subject to the operating and security standards of the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” hhs the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments and comparable agencies in the us and other countries we maintain extensive controlled substance monitoring and reporting programs at considerable expense in order to help us meet those standards we have incurred monetary penalties and licensing sanctions pursuant to these requirements and future allegations of noncompliance could result in our inability to obtain maintain or renew permits licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses 

additionally the company is a defendant in many litigation matters alleging claims related to its distribution of controlled substances opioids including claims about regulatory compliance on february 25 2022 the company and two other us pharmaceutical distribution companies collectively distributors determined that there is sufficient state and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement to settle a substantial majority of opioidsrelated lawsuits filed against the distributors by us states territories and local governmental entities the company incurs and expects to continue to incur significant expense in order to resolve those and other opioidsrelated matters as part of that resolution the company will bear a portion of the expense to establish and maintain a clearinghouse for data related to distribution of controlled substance for more information about those litigation matters refer to financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

government contracts our contracts with government entities typically are subject to procurement laws that include socioeconomic employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements these statutory and regulatory requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden we are subject to audits investigations and oversight proceedings about our compliance with contractual and legal requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements or we fail an audit we may be subject to sanctions such as monetary damages criminal and civil penalties termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work 

mckesson corporation 

federal state and local governmental entities in the us and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny of practices that may indicate fraud waste and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers healthcare providers and other companies and individuals as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to statutes regulations and government guidance that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and as such may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense failure to comply with these laws including the federal antikickback statute could subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs or pursue government contracts 

healthcare regulation in the us the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers there are also further efforts to broaden healthcare coverage us lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices including requiring greater price transparency authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under the medicare program and drug importation measures provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and patients by regulating pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control government healthcare system costs european governments are continuously reviewing measures to support the reduction of public healthcare spending such measures can exert pressure on pricing frameworks and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals which in turn may impact customer behavior there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood and timing of any healthcare policy reform as each eu country operates in a separate healthcare environment 

in december 2020 the cms issued a final rule pertaining to “best price” reporting requirements under the medicaid drug rebate program among other things that rule may impact drug pricing and solutions to help patients afford their medications this rule is subject to ongoing litigation unless the legal challenge to the rule is successful the rule will likely become effective on january 1 2023 there is substantial uncertainly about the likelihood timing and ultimate resolutions of these lawsuits 

additionally there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical drug supply chain in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit stolen contaminated or otherwise harmful drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking for example the us drug quality and security act of 2013 “dqsa” requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements and the us food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies such as track and trace or authentication technologies to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs we also have recordkeeping and other obligations under the eu falsified medicines directive pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs 

mckesson corporation 

data security and privacy we are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” we must maintain administrative physical and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information “protected health information” and ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information we are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union the personal information protection and electronic documents act “pipeda” in canada and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy laws in the united states including the california consumer protection act “ccpa” some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions or otherwise limit our use of data many of these laws also require us to provide access or other data rights modification deletion portability etc to consumers’ and patients’ individual personal data records within specified periods of time laws such as the federal cyber incident reporting for critical infrastructure act of 2022 may require us to provide notifications of significant data privacy breaches or cybersecurity incidents before our investigations are complete we are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity fines private litigation including class actions reputational impacts and other costs we also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy and data security laws our efforts to comply with privacy and data security laws complicate our operations and add to our costs 

environmental regulation we are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations including those relating to radiationemitting equipment operated at us oncology network practices additionally our operations are subject to regulations under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites as discussed in more detail below we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are not material to our operations or financial position other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws regulations or government guidance in the future 

climate change regulation governments in the us and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climaterelated matters additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources and other requirements compliance with climaterelated laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions new or expanded climaterelated laws could impose costs on us including capital expenditures to develop data gathering and reporting systems until the timing and extent of climaterelated laws are clarified we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations

some of our distribution arrangements with manufacturers provide us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development research and development expenses were 70 million 74 million and 96 million during 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively

litigation and regulatory risks 

we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 

we are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes which may include asserted class action litigation such as those described in financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report regulatory proceedings involve allegations such as false claims healthcare fraud and abuse and antitrust violations civil litigation proceedings involve commercial employment environmental intellectual property tort and other claims despite valid defenses that we assert legal disputes are often costly timeconsuming distracting to management and disruptive to normal business operations the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter ultimately is favorably resolved the outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict outcomes can occur that are not justified by the evidence or existing law outcomes include monetary damages penalties and fines and injunctive or other relief that requires us to change our business operations and incur significant expense accordingly legal disputes might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might experience losses not covered by insurance or indemnification 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans for example pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions mislabeling of prescriptions inadequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable or coverages might not cover our losses we generally seek to limit our contractual exposure but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability uninsured losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we experience costly legal disputes government actions and adverse publicity regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids 

the company is a defendant in many litigation matters alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances opioids as described in financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report we regularly are named as a defendant in similar new cases the plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities such as states provinces counties and municipalities as well as businesses groups and individuals the cases allege violations of controlled substance laws and other laws and they make common law claims such as negligence and public nuisance many of these cases raise novel theories of liability any proceedings can have unexpected outcomes that are not justified by evidence or existing law legal proceedings such as these often involve significant expense management time and distraction and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify it is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years outcomes include monetary damages penalties and fines and injunctive or other relief that requires us to change our business operations and incur significant expense although the company has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself some proceedings have been and others may be resolved by negotiated outcome not all proceedings however are resolved by settlement our reputation has been and may continue to be impacted by publicity regarding the litigation and related allegations the adverse outcome of legal proceedings might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might experience increased costs to distribute controlled substances such as opioids 

legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation liabilities for taxes or assessments or other costs of compliance under any such laws might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation business operations and our financial position or results of operations

we may be unsuccessful in achieving our strategic growth objectives 

our business strategy to become a diversified healthcare services company includes investing to build an integrated oncology service business and expand our biopharma services business our ability to grow those businesses will depend on our hiring and retaining talented individuals with necessary knowledge and skills acquiring developing and implementing new technologies and capabilities forming and expanding business relationships and successfully competing against providers of similar services some competitors have more experience than we do in enabling technologies such as data analytics we may not achieve our desired return on our investments through our growth strategies if we fail to achieve acceptable sales and profitability in our strategic growth areas it might have a materially adverse impact on our business prospects and our financial position or results of operations 

our business strategy included expanding our retail pharmacy operations our retail pharmacy operations involve numerous risks such as the following ones we might encounter difficulties attracting and retaining customers to our retail locations due to their unfamiliarity with our brands or our inexperience with local market preferences competition from our retail pharmacy operations might strain relationships with our retail pharmacy customers consolidation of retail pharmacies with thirdparty payers expansion of large retail pharmacy networks reductions in reimbursement rates shifts in the mix of branded and generic pharmaceutical sales and exclusion from preferred pharmacy networks can impair our retail pharmacy sales and profitability failure to maintain profitable retail pharmacy operations may result in significant costs including those associated with site closures and reductions in workforce we incur longlived asset impairments related to our retail pharmacy networks if our retail pharmacy operations fail to achieve or are unable to sustain acceptable net sales and profitability levels it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions payment defaults or contract nonrenewal 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from and have a significant portion of our accounts receivable with a small number of customers at march 31 2022 sales to our largest customer represented approximately 21 of our consolidated revenues and approximately 28 of our trade receivables and those of our ten largest customers combined accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated revenues and approximately 43 of our trade receivables a material default in payment reduction in purchases or the loss of business from a large customer might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks 

our contracts with government entities are subject to risks such as lack of funding and compliance with unique requirements for example government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding which may be eliminated or reduced in addition the future volume of products or services purchased by a government customer is often uncertain our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little prior notice government contracts typically expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts in addition government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socioeconomic employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements for example our contracts with the us government generally require us to comply with the federal acquisition regulations procurement integrity act buy american act trade agreements act and other laws and regulations we are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements or we fail an audit we may be subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages criminal and civil penalties termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work these requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

our participation in vaccination distribution programs may materially affect our operating results reputation and business 

we participate as a distributor in governmentsponsored vaccination programs such as the us government’s covid19 distribution program “federal covid19 response” we also provide supplies used for vaccine administration in the federal covid19 response our participation in such programs exposes us to various uncertainties for example the novel nature and rapid mutation of the sarscov‑2 virus the changing distribution scope of covid19 vaccines supply chain stability inflation and the effectiveness of other covid19 transmission mitigation measures introduce uncertainty about what volumes of vaccines and related supplies may be distributed by us the safety and efficacy of newly developed vaccines and the cost of distribution because of such uncertainties our operating results may be subject to variability our participation in such programs also exposes us to various risks including regulatory compliance government oversight dependence on government funding contractual performance litigation security risks and supply chain challenges any significant problems with our participation in such programs might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and our business because of these risks and uncertainties our operating results may be materially higher or lower than our projections 

mckesson corporation 

we might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers 

we attempt to structure our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide certain distribution agreements with manufacturers include pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation and we cannot control the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price changes we might be unable to renew pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers in a timely and favorable manner any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might infringe intellectual property rights or our intellectual property protections might be inadequate 

we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties but third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and may do so in the future if a court were to hold that we infringed other’s rights we might be required to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license stop selling or using the infringing products or services or incur other sanctions we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure obligations and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions we might initiate costly and timeconsuming litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others our intellectual property protection efforts might be inadequate to protect our rights our competitors might develop noninfringing products or services equivalent or superior to ours any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

our use of thirdparty data is subject to limitations that could impede the growth of our data services business 

we attempt to structure our diligence processes to satisfy contractual and other operative data usage rights and limitations associated with customer partner and other thirdparty data flowing through our businesses these rights and limitations can apply to both confidential commercial data and personal data provided to us by these customers partners and other third parties failure to satisfy these data usage rights and limitations can lead to contractual breach and other legal claims or reputational impacts if a court were to hold that we violated these contractual rights we might be required to pay substantial damages we may need to stop using sharing andor selling certain products and services or we could incur other financial legal andor reputational consequences in addition in order to reach our data strategy growth objectives we might be unable to obtain at an acceptable cost the data usage rights needed to advance such goals any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees including key executives and other talent is essential for us to meet our objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers results in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes such as illness and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles employees might not successfully transition into new roles any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

industry and economic risks 

we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models 

many of our products and services are designed and intended to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems the healthcare industry and related government programs are changing some of these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business 

for example some changes in reimbursement methodologies including government rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers those changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models and increases in the use of managed care 

mckesson corporation 

in the us the aca significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers there have been continued efforts to challenge the aca there are also efforts to broaden healthcare coverage us lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices including requiring greater price transparency enabling medicare to directly negotiate drug prices and drug importation measures these proposals might result in significant changes in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models 

private challenges to government healthcare policy may also have significant impacts on our business for example over a dozen pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally restricted sales under the 340b drug pricing program to contract pharmacies the 340b drug pricing program requires manufacturers to offer discounts on certain drugs purchased by “covered entities” which include safetynet providers the hrsa has taken the position that a covered entity may dispense such discounted drugs through multiple contract pharmacies starting in 2020 some manufacturers began to restrict such practices a number of manufacturers and the hhs continue to litigate these issues so far lower courts have rendered somewhat conflicting opinions 

provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers 

many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and patients by regulating pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control government healthcare system costs european governments are continuously reviewing measures to support the reduction of public healthcare spending such measures can exert pressure on pricing frameworks and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals which in turn may impact customer behavior there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood and timing of any healthcare policy reform as each eu country operates in a separate healthcare environment 

although there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood timing and results of these health reform efforts their implementation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation 

our businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses due to consolidation a few large suppliers control a significant share of the pharmaceuticals market this concentration reduces our ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and causes us to depend on a smaller number of suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations have consolidated and have greater power to negotiate favorable prices consolidation by our customers suppliers and competitors might reduce the number of market participants and give the remaining enterprises greater bargaining power which might lead to erosion in our profit margin consolidation might increase counterparty credit risk because credit purchases increase for fewer market participants these competitive pressures and industry consolidation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply 

our supply arrangements might be interrupted or adversely affected by a variety of causes over which we have no control such as export controls or trade sanctions labor disputes unavailability of key manufacturing sites inability to procure raw materials quality control concerns ethical sourcing issues supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other general supply constraints our inventory might be requisitioned diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency disaster and civil defense declarations the fda banned certain manufacturers from selling raw materials and drug ingredients in the us due to quality issues for example government actions in response to the covid19 pandemic affect our supply allocation and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships changes in the healthcare industry’s or our suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income we might experience disruptions in our supply of higher margin pharmaceuticals including generic pharmaceuticals any of these changes or disruptions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals 

our generic pharmaceuticals distribution business is subject to pricing risks we might be adversely impacted if our clarusone joint venture is unsuccessful or experiences margins declines generic drug manufacturers often offer a generic version of branded pharmaceuticals while they challenge the validity or enforceability branded pharmaceutical patents the patent holder might assert infringement claims against us for distributing those generic versions and the generic drug manufactures may not fully indemnify us against such claims these risks as well as changes in the availability pricing volatility reimbursement rates for generic drugs or significant changes in the nature frequency or magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by inflation an economic slowdown or recession 

inflationary conditions result in increased costs and decreased levels of consumer commercial spending and to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases from our suppliers increase the costs which we incur to purchase inventories and services inflationary pressure is increased by supply chain disruptions and reduced availability of key commodities cost inflation during 2022 generally increased our transportation operational and other administrative costs associated with our normal business operations an economic slowdown or recession could reduce the prices our customers are able or willing to pay for our products and services and reduce the volume of their purchases recessionary pressure may be increased by the covid19 pandemic and regional political and military conflicts any economic slowdown or recession and the impact of inflation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

disruption or other changes in capital and credit markets might impede access to credit and increase borrowing costs for us and our customers and suppliers and might impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by financial institutions or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market might adversely affect our borrowing ability and cost of borrowing we generally sell our products and services under shortterm unsecured credit arrangements an adverse change in general economic conditions or access to capital might cause our customers to reduce their purchases from us or delay or fail paying amounts owed to us suppliers might increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale due to limited availability of credit suppliers might be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives these risks are increased by the covid19 pandemic and regional political and military conflicts interest rate increases or changes in capital market conditions might impede our or our customers’ or suppliers’ ability or cost to obtain credit any of these risks might have a material adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business in various currencies including the us dollar euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in us dollars for example we are exposed to transactional currency exchange risk due to our import and export of products that are purchased or sold in currencies other than the us dollar we also have currency exchange risk due to intercompany loans denominated in various currencies the covid19 pandemic and regional political and military conflict have affected and might increase currency exchange rate volatility we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

executive summary 

the following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business operating results financial condition and liquidity for the year ended march 31 2022 

• the pandemic disease caused by the sarscov2 coronavirus “covid19” impacted our results of operations for the year ended march 31 2022 as previously disclosed in our 2021 annual report pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased across the enterprise during the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the weakened and uncertain global economic environment and covid19 restrictions including governmentmandated business shutdowns and shelterinplace orders following the onset of the pandemic the recovery from the pandemic is favorably reflected in our results when comparing 2022 versus 2021 we also had favorable contributions from our covid19 vaccine and related ancillary supply kit distribution programs during 2022 

• in 2021 we began distributing certain covid19 vaccines under the direction of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” since 2021 and through the end of 2022 we distributed over 380 million covid19 vaccine doses to administration sites all across the us and in support of the us government’s international donation mission for a more indepth discussion of how covid19 impacted our business operations and outlook refer to the covid19 section of trends and uncertainties included below 

• revenues of 264 billion reflects an 11 increase from the prior year primarily driven by market growth in our us pharmaceutical segment 

• gross profit increased 8 from the prior year primarily driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid19 vaccines in our medicalsurgical solutions segment as well as growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and the contribution from our covid19 vaccination distribution program in our us pharmaceutical segment

trends and uncertainties 

the impact of inflationary and global events 

our business and results of operations financial condition and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions including inflation increased competition for talent and disruption of the supply chain as well as by political or civil unrest or military action including the conflict between russia and ukraine cost inflation during 2022 generally affects us by increasing transportation operational and other administrative costs associated with our normal business operations which we might not be able to fully pass along to our customers although it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future they did not have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity for the year ended march 31 2022 

covid19 

the sarscov2 novel strain of coronavirus which causes the infectious disease known as covid19 continues to evolve since it was declared a global pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization we continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the ongoing impacts covid19 has on our business operations and financial results the full extent to which covid19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments which are described in our “risks and forwardlooking information” section below 

our response to covid19 in the workplace 

we are committed to continuing to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees the various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our business operations include telecommuting and workfromhome policies restricted travel employee support programs and enhanced safety measures during the first quarter of 2022 we approved changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies and support flexibility for our employees including a partial remote work model for certain employees as further discussed in this financial review and in financial note 3 “restructuring impairment and related charges net” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report during the third quarter of 2022 we continued to refine our policies and apply safety measures in the workplace as recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” as covid19 cases increased across north america and europe driven by the highly contagious omicron variant 

during 2022 we continued covid19 vaccination protocols for our us and canada employees which are designed to be consistent with federal state and local laws and with customer requirements and to protect the safety of our employees customers patients and communities while also safeguarding the healthcare supply chain in europe we followed applicable government guidelines we continue to monitor all of these changing laws requirements and guidelines we have not observed a material increase in employee turnover as a result of covid19 vaccination protocols however we are unable to predict whether such protocols will have a material impact on our workforce in the future 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

our role in the distribution of covid19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits 

as a diversified healthcare services leader we remain well positioned to respond to the covid19 pandemic in the us canada and europe we have worked and continue to work closely with national and local governments agencies and industry partners to ensure that available supplies including ppe and medicine reach our customers and patients 

through a contract with the cdc we continue to support the us government as a centralized distributor of covid19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines we began distributing certain covid19 vaccines in december 2020 in the first quarter of 2022 mckesson began supporting the us government’s commitment to donate covid19 vaccines worldwide for this initiative we are responsible for picking and packing the covid19 vaccines into temperaturecontrolled coolers and preparing them for pickup by an international partner we do not manage the actual shipments of the vaccines to other countries the results of operations related to our vaccine distribution are reflected in our us pharmaceutical segment we also continue to manage the assembly storage and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer covid19 vaccines including sourcing some of those supplies through agreements with both the department of health and human services “hhs” and pfizer inc the results of operations for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies are reflected in our medicalsurgical solutions segment the future financial impact of the arrangements with the cdc and hhs depend on numerous uncertainties which are described in our “risks and forwardlooking information” section below 

mckesson canada and mckesson europe are playing a role by supporting governments and public health entities through distributing covid19 vaccines and administering them in pharmacies additionally mckesson canada and mckesson europe are distributing covid19 tests and certain ppe 

trends in our business 

at the onset of the covid19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter of 2020 we had higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes and increased retail pharmacy foot traffic as our customers increased supplies on hand in march during 2021 pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased as a result of the weakened and uncertain global economic environment and covid19 restrictions including governmentmandated business shutdowns and shelterinplace orders we also had a decrease in demand for primary care medicalsurgical supplies due to deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic and closures of doctors’ offices which was partially offset by demand for ppe and covid19 tests additionally the decreased traffic in doctors’ offices and general shelterinplace guidance by governmental authorities negatively impacted retail pharmacy foot traffic in both europe and canada this drove favorability in our results when comparing 2022 versus 2021 particularly during the first quarter 

we have observed improvements in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits during 2022 compared to the prior year period however the recovery of covid19 continues to be nonlinear and impacted by virus variants such as omicron and ongoing fluctuations in case levels during the year ended march 31 2022 the us distribution of covid19 vaccines and related ancillary kits favorably impacted our results we recognized higher sales for covid19 tests primarily due to limited product availability in the first quarter of 2021 and increased demand during 2022 corresponding with the spike in positive covid19 cases as a result of the delta and omicron variants 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

impact to our supply chain 

we also continue to monitor and address the covid19 pandemic impacts on our supply chain although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers their locations and the extent to which they are impacted by the covid19 pandemic we are proactively working with manufacturers industry partners and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic overall during 2022 we had an increase in supply chain costs primarily related to transportation and labor however this did not materially impact our results of operations for the year ended march 31 2022 in our medicalsurgical solutions segment we have observed certain supply chain disruptions for covid19 tests which poses a potential risk for supply availability to meet the future demand as potential shortages or disruptions of any products are identified we address supply continuity which includes securing additional products when available sourcing backup products when needed and following allocation procedures to maintain and protect supply as much as possible we utilize business continuity action planning to maintain and protect operations across all locations and facilities 

impact to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

for the year ended march 31 2022 covid19 tests and the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid19 vaccines in our medicalsurgical solutions segment contributed approximately 18 billion or 16 to segment revenues and including total inventory charges as further described below increased our segment operating profit by approximately 208 million or 22 

the distribution of covid19 vaccines in our us pharmaceutical segment contributed less than 10 to segment operating profit during the year ended march 31 2022 the financial impact from our covid19 response efforts in the international segment during 2022 was not material to our consolidated results but contributed to year over year favorability in segment operating results during the year ended march 31 2021 particularly during the first quarter we had lower pharmaceutical volumes specialty drug volumes and patient care visits that negatively impacted our consolidated revenues and income loss from continuing operations before income taxes the recovery of prescription volume trends and patient care visits which are also described in more detail above in the “trends in our business” section had a favorable impact year over year across our businesses when comparing 2022 versus 2021 

additionally certain ppe items held for resale were valued in our inventory at costs that were inflated by earlier covid19 pandemic demand levels that inventory valuation if not supported by market resale prices may be written down to net realizable value we may also writeoff inventory due to decreased customer demand and excess inventory during the year ended march 31 2022 we recorded inventory charges totaling 164 million on certain ppe and other related products in our medicalsurgical solutions segment of this amount we recorded 147 million in cost of sales driven by the intent of management not to sell certain excess ppe inventory which required an inventory writedown to zero and instead direct it to charitable organizations or otherwise dispose we recorded 8 million in total operating expenses for excess inventory which had already been committed for donation at the time of the charge and subsequently was delivered during 2022 in addition 9 million of inventory charges were recorded in cost of sales for ppe and other related products that management intends to sell although market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand may require additional writedowns in future periods of other ppe and related product categories we are taking measures to mitigate such risk 

overall these covid19 related items had a net favorable impact on consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march 31 2022 compared to the prior year period impacts to future periods due to covid19 may differ based on future developments which is described in our “risks and forwardlooking information” section below 

during the year ended march 31 2022 we maintained appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels and experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor the covid19 situation closely and engage with manufacturers industry partners and government agencies to anticipate shortages and respond to demand for certain medications and therapies we are monitoring our customers closely for changes to their timing of payments or ability to pay amounts owed to us as a result of covid19 pandemic impacts to their businesses we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility longterm debt markets and commercial paper markets our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations have remained open and accessible to us during the covid19 pandemic at march 31 2022 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates judgments and assumptions used in our forecasts we still face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects of covid19 on our future business operations financial condition results of operations and liquidity the full extent to which covid19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments including the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic potential seasonality of viral outbreaks impacts of additional variants of the sarscov2 virus the amount of covid19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits that we are contracted to distribute the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and governmental measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus the effectiveness of treatments of infected individuals commercialization of covid19 vaccines competition in covid19 vaccine distribution and changes or disruptions in product supply we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic on supply chains due to several rapidly changing variables related to the covid19 pandemic estimations of future economic trends and the timing of when covid19 may no longer significantly impact our ability to forecast future financial performance remain challenging additionally we periodically review our intangible and other longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable key assumptions and estimates about future values in our impairment assessments can be affected by a variety of factors including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on industry and economic trends as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts material changes to key assumptions and estimates can decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and have resulted in impairment charges of certain longlived assets and could potentially result in future impairment charges refer to item 1a  risk factors in part i of this annual report for a disclosure of risk factors related to covid19 

opioidrelated litigation and claims 

we are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances opioids in federal and state courts throughout the us and in puerto rico and canada the plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general county and municipal governments tribal nations hospitals health and welfare funds thirdparty payors and individuals 

on february 25 2022 the company and two other united states pharmaceutical distribution companies collectively distributors determined that there is sufficient state and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement settlement to settle a substantial majority of opioidsrelated lawsuits filed against the distributors by us states territories and local governmental entities under the settlement 46 of 49 eligible states and their participating subdivisions as well as the district of columbia and all eligible territories collectively settling governmental entities have agreed to join the settlement the settlement became effective on april 2 2022 if all conditions to the settlement are satisfied including the receipt of approval by relevant courts of consent decrees to dismiss the lawsuits the distributors would pay the settling governmental entities up to approximately 195 billion over 18 years with up to approximately 74 billion to be paid by the company for its 381 portion under the settlement a minimum of 85 of the settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic most of the remaining percentage relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs and would be payable over a shorter time period under the settlement the distributors will establish a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlledsubstance distribution data which will be available to the settling us states to use as part of their antidiversion efforts the settlement provides that the distributors do not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses 

the settlement only addresses the claims of attorneys general of us states and territories and political subdivisions in participating states and territories the terms under which the distributors previously agreed to settle opioids claims of the states of new york ohio rhode island florida and texas and each of their participating subdivisions will become part of the settlement the previously disclosed agreement for the distributors to settle opioids claims of the attorney general of west virginia will remain a separate settlement arrangement that is not part of the settlement governmental entities not participating in the settlement may continue to pursue their claims the states of alabama oklahoma and washington chose not to participate in the settlement we have reached separate agreements in principle with the attorneys general of alabama and washington to settle the claims of those states and their subdivisions the distributors previously settled with the cherokee nation and reached a separate agreement in principle to settle the claims of the remaining federally recognized native american tribes

we recorded a charge of 81 billion during the year ended march 31 2021 related to our estimated liability to us governmental entities including those expected to participate in the settlement the states and subdivisions that were not expected to participate or were not eligible and the native american tribes in connection with the settlement and other opioidrelated settlement accruals described above we recorded additional charges of 274 million during the year ended march 31 2022 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations our total estimated liability for opioidrelated claims was 83 billion as of march 31 2022 of which 10 billion was included in “other accrued liabilities” for the amount estimated to be paid prior to march 31 2023 and the remaining liability was included in “longterm litigation liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet 

although the vast majority of opioid claims have been brought by governmental entities in the us the company is also a defendant in cases brought in the us by private plaintiffs such as hospitals health and welfare funds thirdparty payors and individuals as well as four cases brought in canada three by governmental or tribal entities and one by an individual these claims and those of private entities generally are not included in the settlement or in the charges recorded by the company described above the company believes it has valid legal defenses in these matters and intends to mount a vigorous defense 

because of the many uncertainties associated with ongoing opioidrelated litigation matters we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioidrelated litigation matters in light of the uncertainty the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued 

notwithstanding the settlement we also continue to prepare for trial in pending matters we believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and absent an acceptable settlement intend to vigorously defend against all such claims an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position cash flows or liquidity or results of operations refer to financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information

revenues 

revenues increased for the years ended march 31 2022 and 2021 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to market growth including expanded business with existing customers within our us pharmaceutical segment market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion

goodwill impairments 

as discussed in the “overview of our business” section our operating structure was realigned commencing in the second quarter of 2021 into four reportable segments us pharmaceutical rxts medicalsurgical solutions and international these reportable segments encompass all operating segments of the company the segment realignment resulted in changes in multiple reporting units across the company as a result we were required to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units and recorded a goodwill impairment charge in our europe retail pharmacy reporting unit of 69 million during the second quarter of 2021 at march 31 2022 the balance of goodwill for our reporting units in europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the international segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in canada 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 and at an interim date if indicators of potential impairment exist the annual impairment testing performed in 2022 and 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill however other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods including our mckesson canada reporting unit within our international segment where the risk of material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units refer to “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review for further information 

restructuring initiatives and longlived asset impairments 

during the first quarter of 2022 we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees this initiative primarily included the rationalization of our office space in north america where we ceased using office space we exited the portion of the facility no longer used we also retained and repurposed certain other office locations we recorded charges of 124 million for the year ended march 31 2022 primarily related to lease rightofuse and other longlived asset impairments lease exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization this initiative was substantially complete in 2022 after which immaterial charges will continue to be incurred through the termination date of certain leases

interest expense 

interest expense decreased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the repayment of 10 billion of longterm debt in the third quarter of 2021 and our tender offer activity in the second quarter of 2022 interest expense fluctuates based on timing amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters based upon past experience and management’s judgment that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowances for credit losses our receivables primarily consist of shortterm trade accounts receivable from customers that result from the sale of goods and services we also provide other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts

at march 31 2022 trade and notes receivables were 168 billion prior to allowances of 99 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 our provision for bad debts was 29 million 4 million and 91 million respectively at march 31 2022 and 2021 the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 06 and 12 respectively an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2022 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 17 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worstcase scenarios additional information concerning our allowances for credit losses may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report 

inventories inventories consist of merchandise held for resale we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value except for inventories determined using the lifo method which are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under lifo approximates market the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the firstin firstout “fifo” method and weightedaverage purchase prices rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold 

in determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

at march 31 2022 and 2021 total inventories net were 187 billion and 192 billion respectively in our consolidated balance sheets the lifo method was used to value approximately 63 and 58 of our inventories at march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively if we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation inventories would have been approximately 383 million and 406 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory we recognized lifo credits of 23 million 38 million and 252 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively in our consolidated statements of operations the lower lifo credits in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded offpatent to generic drug launches our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2022 and 2021 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a riskadjusted discount rate some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life refer to financial note 4 “business acquisitions and divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and longlived assets 

goodwill 

as a result of acquiring businesses we have 95 billion of goodwill at march 31 2022 and 2021 and 21 billion and 29 billion of intangible assets net at march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

we apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value if any but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the reasonableness of our concluded fair values 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge under the market approach significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit under the income approach significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates the discount rates represent the weightedaverage cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure included in the estimate of the weightedaverage cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections an increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate 

the annual impairment testing performed for 2022 2021 and 2020 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill the segment change in the second quarter of 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the company and as a result goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 69 million in 2021 as the estimated fair value of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit within the international segment at march 31 2022 and 2021 the balance of goodwill in the international segment primarily relates to our mckesson canada reporting unit 

the estimated fair value of our mckesson canada reporting unit in our international segment exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 22 in 2022 the goodwill balance of this reporting unit was 15 billion at march 31 2022 or approximately 16 of the consolidated goodwill balance generally a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of approximately 22 for mckesson canada or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 2 could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods under the income approach other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions may require us to further revise the projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods refer to financial note 11 “goodwill and intangible assets net” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information 

longlived assets 

currently all of our intangible and other longlived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 24 years we review intangible and other longlived assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of intangible and other longlived assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 

our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income refer to financial note 3 “restructuring impairment and related charges net” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our longlived asset impairments 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

longlived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized fair value is determined based on the total consideration expected to be received by the company the fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group when the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale 

valuation of equity method investments we evaluate our investments for otherthantemporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired when the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment we consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost the financial condition of the investees and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary expectations about the business operations of investees as well as industry financial and market factors any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties including those used to conclude on the taxfree nature of the separation of the change healthcare jv and the unrecognized tax position related to opioidrelated litigation and claims and may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations 

we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided 



mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties in conjunction with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party on february 25 2022 the company and two other us pharmaceutical distribution companies collectively “distributors” determined that there is sufficient state and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement to settle a substantial majority of opioidrelated lawsuits filed against the distributors by us states territories and local governmental entities based on our estimated liability under the settlement and to governmental entities not expected to participate in the settlement we recorded a charge of 81 billion for the year ended march 31 2021 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations included in this annual report in connection with the settlement and other opioidrelated settlement accruals we recorded additional charges of 274 million during the year ended march 31 2022 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations because of the many uncertainties associated with the remaining opioidrelated litigation matters we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioidrelated litigation matters while we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity refer to financial note 18 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund our shortterm and longterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our 40 billion revolving credit facility at march 31 2022 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future

we believe that our future operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2022 and 2021 included approximately 15 billion and 23 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the us respectively our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the us is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes following enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the repatriation of cash to the us is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and receivables as well as an increase in other accrued liabilities and an increase in our current portion of debt partially offset by a decrease in drafts and accounts payable and an increase in net current assets held for sale related to our eu disposal group and uk disposal group consolidated working capital improved at march 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables 

our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended march 31 2022 primarily due to an increase in mckesson stockholders’ deficit driven by share repurchases partially offset by net income for the year to date period our debt to capital ratio was also impacted by a decrease in total debt from the completion of a cash tender offer to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of 922 million and the redemption of our €600 million eurodenominated notes both in july 2021 partially offset by the issuance of notes with a principal amount of 500 million in august 2021 our debt to capital ratio increased for 2021 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by net loss for the year and share repurchases 

on july 23 2021 we raised our quarterly dividend from 042 to 047 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the board dividends were 183 per share in 2022 and 167 per share in 2021 we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2022 and 2021 we paid total cash dividends of 277 million and 276 million respectively 

our redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily related to our consolidated subsidiary mckesson europe at march 31 2021 the carrying value was 13 billion and we owned approximately 78 of mckesson europe’s outstanding common shares under the domination agreement the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe had a right to put “put right” their shares at €2299 per share increased annually for interest in the amount of five percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the german bundesbank less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid by mckesson “put amount” during 2022 and 2021 we paid 10 billion and 49 million respectively to purchase 345 million and 18 million shares respectively of mckesson europe through exercises of the put right by the noncontrolling shareholders which reduced the balance of our redeemable noncontrolling interests 

the put right expired on june 15 2021 at which point the remaining shares owned by the minority shareholders valued at 287 million were transferred from redeemable noncontrolling interests to noncontrolling interests at march 31 2022 we owned approximately 95 of mckesson europe’s outstanding common shares 

additionally we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €083 per mckesson europe share the “compensation amount” to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe under the domination agreement the compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the consolidated statements of operations the domination agreement does not expire but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six months’ advance notice

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2022 and 2021 we had 35 billion and 63 billion respectively in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 basis points increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings would not have resulted in a material impact to earnings in 2022 or 2021 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign currency exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps the forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps are intended to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of march 31 2022 and 2021 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 122 million and 267 million respectively however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 15 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps 

mckesson corporation 

in july 2021 we announced our intention to exit our businesses in europe during 2022 we entered into an agreement to sell certain of our businesses in the european union which is anticipated to close within the second half of fiscal year 2023 we also completed the sale of our austrian business during 2022 and on april 6 2022 we completed the sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the united kingdom refer to financial note 2 “held for sale” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on these divestitures subsequent to the completion of these divestitures our foreign currency exchange rate risk will be primarily limited to the canadian dollar 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

health and safety our security and safety departments employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate any potential risks this includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security we routinely assess facilities to monitor closely adherence to established security and safety standards if we identify a vulnerability it is documented and the facility prepares an action plan our employees receive specialized training related to their role work setting and equipment used in their work environment as our processes evolve we update relevant safety training modules which may include new employee training programs in response to the covid19 pandemic our priority has been and continues to be protecting the health and safety of our employees the various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our business operations including telecommuting and workfromhome policies restricted travel and enhanced safety measures are intended to limit employee exposure to the virus that causes covid19 as they perform their jobs while also providing employee support programs and a sense of belonging for additional information on our response to covid19 in the workplace refer to the covid19 section of “trends and uncertainties” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

government regulation 

mckesson generally and in many of the highly regulated industries in which it operates is subject to oversight by various federal state and local governmental entities failure to comply with laws regulations and guidance promulgated by those entities could have a material adverse impact to the company’s business operations reputation results of operations and financial position 

controlled substances we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments hhs the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” and other comparable agencies we have received monetary penalties andor licensing sanctions pursuant to these requirements and future allegations of noncompliance could result in an inability to obtain maintain or renew permits licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses 

mckesson corporation 

additionally the company is a defendant in approximately 3200 cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances opioids as described in financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k the plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities such as states provinces counties and municipalities as well as businesses groups and individuals as a result of ongoing advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework to resolve the claims of governmental entities and our assessment of certain other opioidrelated claims we have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable and recorded a charge of 81 billion for the year ended march 31 2021 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations in this annual report on form 10k because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioidrelated litigation including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioidrelated litigation matters the adverse outcome of legal proceedings might also involve significant expense management time and distraction and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify in addition to this litigation legislative or regulatory measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation 

government contracts our contracts with government entities are subject to unique compliance risks and typically are subject to procurement laws that include socioeconomic employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements we are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements or we fail an audit we may be subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages criminal and civil penalties termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work these requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden and material noncompliance could harm our reputation 

local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving or allegedly involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid other government healthcare programs and government contracts our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws regulation and government guidance on fraud and abuse many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and as such may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and government guidance including but not limited to those involving the regulation of controlled substances the federal antikickback statute and others could subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs or pursue government contracts 

healthcare regulation in the us the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers there are also further efforts to broaden healthcare coverage us lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending these measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood timing and results of these health reform efforts 

mckesson corporation 

additionally there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking for example the us drug quality and security act of 2013 “dqsa” requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements and the us food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies such as track and trace or authentication technologies to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs we also have recordkeeping and other obligations under the eu falsified medicines directive pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs 

data security and privacy we are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” we must maintain administrative physical and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information “protected health information” and ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information we are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union the personal information protection and electronic documents act “pipeda” in canada and the california consumer protection act “ccpa” some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions we are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity fines private litigation including class actions and other costs we also have contractual obligations to customers that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy laws our efforts to comply with privacy laws complicate our operations and add to our compliance costs 

we and our external service providers use technology and systems to perform our business operations such as the secure electronic transmission processing storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information and other types of personal information confidential financial information proprietary information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce despite physical technical and administrative security measures that we implement in order to among other things address regulatory requirements our technology systems and operations may continue to be subject to cybersecurity incidents the risk of cybersecurity incidents may be increased due to a variety of factors both internal and external a cybersecurity incident might involve a material data breach or other material impact to the integrity and operations of the technology systems and operations which might result in litigation or regulatory action 

environmental regulation we are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations including those relating to radiationemitting equipment operated at us oncology network practices additionally our operations are subject to regulations under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites as discussed in more detail below we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations presently are not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws regulations or government guidance in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2021 and is not expected to be material in the next year 

mckesson corporation 

climate change regulation governments in the us and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climaterelated matters additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources and other requirements compliance with climaterelated laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions new or expanded climaterelated laws could impose substantial costs on us until the timing and extent of climaterelated laws are clarified we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations 

other information about the business 

customers during 2021 sales to our ten largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 51 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 21 of our total consolidated revenues in 2021 in may 2019 we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with cvs to june 2023 our ten largest customers comprised approximately 32 and cvs was approximately 19 of total trade accounts receivable at march 31 2021 we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our us pharmaceutical segment 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 7 of our purchases in 2021 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound the ten largest suppliers in 2021 accounted for approximately 50 of our purchases 

some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development research and development “rd” expenses were 74 million 96 million and 71 million during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

litigation and regulatory risks 

we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 

we are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes which may include asserted class action litigation such as those described in financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements in this report regulatory proceedings might involve allegations such as false claims healthcare fraud and abuse and antitrust violations civil litigation proceedings might involve commercial employment environmental intellectual property tort and other claims despite valid defenses that we assert legal disputes are often costly timeconsuming distracting to management and disruptive to normal business operations the outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict outcomes can occur that are not justified by the evidence or existing law the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter is favorably resolved accordingly any legal dispute might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might experience losses not covered by insurance 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans for example pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions mislabeling of prescriptions inadequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable or coverages might not cover our losses we generally seek to limit our contractual exposure but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability uninsured losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

our business strategy included expanding our retail pharmacy operations our retail pharmacy operations involve numerous risks such as the following ones we might encounter difficulties attracting and retaining customers to our retail locations due to their unfamiliarity with our brands or our inexperience with local market preferences competition from our retail pharmacy operations might strain relationships with our retail pharmacy customers consolidation of retail pharmacies with third party payers expansion of large retail pharmacy networks reductions in reimbursement rates shifts in the mix of branded and generic pharmaceutical sales and exclusion from preferred pharmacy networks can impair our retail pharmacy sales and profitability failure to maintain profitable retail pharmacy operations may result in significant costs including those associated with site closures and reductions in workforce if our retail pharmacy operations fail to achieve or are unable to sustain acceptable net sales and profitability levels it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions payment defaults or contract nonrenewal 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from and have a significant portion of our accounts receivable with a small number of customers at march 31 2021 sales to our largest customer represented approximately 21 of our consolidated revenues and approximately 19 of our trade receivables and those of our ten largest customers combined accounted for approximately 51 of our consolidated revenues and approximately 32 of our trade receivables a material default in payment reduction in purchases or the loss of business from a large customer might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks 

our contracts with government entities are subject to risks such as lack of funding and compliance with unique requirements for example government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding which may be eliminated or reduced in addition the future volume of products or services purchased by a government customer is uncertain our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little or no prior notice government contracts typically expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts in addition government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socioeconomic employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements for example our contracts with the us government generally require us to comply with the federal acquisition regulations procurement integrity act buy american act trade agreements act and other laws and regulations we are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements or we fail an audit we are subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages criminal and civil penalties termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work these requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

our participation in vaccination distribution programs may materially affect our operating results reputation and business 

we participate as a distributor in governmentsponsored vaccination programs such as the us government’s covid19 distribution program “federal covid19 response” we also provide supplies used for vaccine administration in the federal covid19 response our participation in such programs exposes us to various uncertainties for example the novel nature of the sarscov‑2 virus and the broad scope of the ongoing covid19 vaccine distribution program introduce uncertainty about what volumes of products may become available for distribution by us the effectiveness of vaccines and the cost of distribution because of such uncertainties our operating results may be subject to variability our participation in such programs also exposes us to various risks including regulatory compliance government oversight dependence on government funding contractual performance litigation security risks and supply chain challenges any significant problems with our participation in such programs might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and our business because of these risks and uncertainties our operating results may be materially higher or lower than our projections 

we might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers 

we attempt to structure our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide certain distribution agreements with manufacturers include pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation and we cannot control the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price changes we might be unable to renew pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers in a timely and favorable manner any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we might infringe intellectual property rights or our intellectual property protections might be inadequate 

we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties but third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and may do so in the future if a court were to hold that we infringed other’s rights we might be required to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license stop selling or using the infringing products or services or incur other sanctions we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure obligations and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions we might initiate costly and timeconsuming litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others our intellectual property protection efforts might be inadequate to protect our rights our competitors might develop noninfringing products or services equivalent or superior to ours any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees including key executives and other talent is essential for us to meet our objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes such as illness and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles employees might not successfully transition into new roles any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

industry and economic risks 

we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models 

many of our products and services are designed and intended to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems the healthcare industry and related government programs are changing some of these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business 

for example some changes in reimbursement methodologies including government rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers those changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models and increases in the use of managed care 

in the us the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers there are continued efforts to challenge the aca there are also efforts to broaden healthcare coverage us lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures these proposals might result in significant changes in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers pbm managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models 

provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers 

many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending these measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices 

mckesson corporation 

although there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood timing and results of these health reform efforts their implementation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation 

our businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses due to consolidation a few large suppliers control a significant share of the pharmaceuticals market this concentration reduces our ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and causes us to depend on a smaller number of suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations have consolidated and have greater power to negotiate favorable prices consolidation by our customers suppliers and competitors might reduce the number of market participants and give the remaining enterprises greater bargaining power which might lead to erosion in our profit margin consolidation might increase counterparty credit risk because credit purchases increase for fewer market participants these competitive pressures and industry consolidation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply 

our supply arrangements might be interrupted or adversely affected by a variety of causes over which we have no control such as export controls or trade sanctions labor disputes unavailability of key manufacturing sites inability to procure raw materials quality control concerns ethical sourcing issues supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war our inventory might be requisitioned diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency disaster and civil defense declarations for example government actions in response to the covid19 pandemic affect our supply allocation and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships changes in the healthcare industry’s or our suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income we might experience disruptions in our supply of higher margin pharmaceuticals including generic pharmaceuticals any of these changes or disruptions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals 

our generic pharmaceuticals distribution business is subject to pricing risks we might be adversely impacted if our clarusone generic pharmaceutical sourcing joint venture with walmart inc is unsuccessful or experiences margins declines generic drug manufacturers often offer a generic version of branded pharmaceuticals while they challenge the validity or enforceability branded pharmaceutical patents the patent holder might assert infringement claims against us for distributing those generic versions and the generic drug manufactures may not fully indemnify us against such claims these risks as well as changes in the availability pricing volatility reimbursement rates for generic drugs or significant changes in the nature frequency or magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown or recession 

an economic slowdown or recession affecting our businesses in one or more regions could reduce the prices our customers are able or willing to pay for our products and services and the volume of their purchases this risk is increased by the covid19 pandemic any economic slowdown or recession might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

disruption or other changes in capital and credit markets might impede access to credit and increase borrowing costs for us and our customers and suppliers and might impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by financial institutions or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market might adversely affect our borrowing ability and cost of borrowing we generally sell our products and services under shortterm unsecured credit arrangements an adverse change in general economic conditions or access to capital might cause our customers to reduce their purchases from us or delay or fail paying amounts owed to us suppliers might increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale due to limited availability of credit suppliers might be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives these risks are increased by the covid19 pandemic interest rate increases or changes in capital market conditions might impede our or our customers’ or suppliers’ ability or cost to obtain credit any of these risks might have a material adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we may have difficulties in sourcing or selling products due to a variety of causes 

we might experience difficulties and delays in sourcing and selling products due to a variety of causes such as difficulties in complying with the legal requirements for export or import of pharmaceuticals or components suppliers’ failure to satisfy production demand manufacturing or supply problems such as inadequate resources and real or perceived quality issues difficulties in product manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in supplier production shutdowns product shortages and other supply disruptions the fda banned certain manufacturers from selling raw materials and drug ingredients in the us due to quality issues the covid19 pandemic adversely affects the availability of some products resulting in product allocation and delivery delays any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to the tax laws in the us at the federal state and local government levels and to the tax laws of many other jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate and cash flow the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by the brexit withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union 

we have operations in the uk and the european union “eu” and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions that might follow the uk withdrawing from the european union “brexit” brexit could adversely affect political regulatory economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets for example we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our uk operations customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by brexit any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business in various currencies including the us dollar euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in us dollars for example we are exposed to transactional currency exchange risk due to our import and export of products that are purchased or sold in currencies other than the us dollar we also have currency exchange risk due to intercompany loans denominated in various currencies the covid19 pandemic has affected and might increase currency exchange rate volatility we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

general risk factors 

we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control such as widespread public health issues natural disasters political events and other catastrophic events 

we might be adversely affected by events outside of our control including widespread public health issues such as epidemic or pandemic infectious diseases natural disasters such as earthquakes floods or severe weather political events such as terrorism military conflicts and trade wars and other catastrophic events these events can disrupt operations for us our suppliers our vendors and our customers for example in february 2021 a severe winter storm affecting the united states temporarily impacted our distribution business operations primarily in texas they might affect consumer confidence levels and spending in response to these events we might suspend operations implement extraordinary procedures seek alternate sources for product supply or suffer consequences that are unexpected and difficult to mitigate in particular the rapid and widespread transmission of the sarscov2 novel coronavirus beginning in late 2019 impacts us in significant ways for example to mitigate the spread of the covid19 disease caused by sarscov2 we implemented travel restrictions and remote working arrangements for most of our employees in order to minimize physical contact and we implemented additional sanitation and personal protection measures in our warehouse retail pharmacy and delivery operations these measures might not fully mitigate covid19 risks to our workforce and we could experience unusual levels of absenteeism that might impair operations and delay delivery of products the covid19 pandemic affects product manufacturing supply and transport availability and cost the pandemic reduces demand for some products due to delays or cancellations of elective medical procedures consumer selfisolation and business closures among other reasons the covid19 pandemic influences shortages of some products with product allocation resulting in delivery delays for customers the ongoing impacts of the pandemic might cause a general economic slowdown or recession in one or more markets disruptions and volatility in global capital markets and other broad and adverse effects on the economy business conditions commercial activity and the healthcare industry the pandemic might impact our business operation financial position and results of operation in unpredictable ways that depend on highly uncertain future developments such as determining the effectiveness of current or future government actions to address the public health or economic impacts of the pandemic any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the longterm effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread the impacts may include physical risks such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions social and human effects such as population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing compliance costs and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes and other adverse effects the effects could impair for example the availability and cost of certain products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require we bear losses incurred as a result of for example physical damage to or destruction of our facilities such as distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change these events and impacts could materially adversely affect our business operations financial position or results of operation

trends and uncertainties 

covid19 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus which causes the infectious disease known as covid19 was reported in wuhan china the who declared covid19 a “public health emergency of international concern” on january 30 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11 2020 

we continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts covid19 has on our business and operations the pandemic developed rapidly during our fourth quarter of 2020 and continued to evolve throughout 2021 infection rates varied throughout our fiscal year peaking in january 2021 a significant number of new covid19 cases continue to be reported particularly in the us these also include cases from new and emerging covid19 variants which could have the potential to be more severe spread more easily require different treatments or change the effectiveness of current vaccines however vaccines which have met the us food and drug administration’s “fda’s” standards for safety effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization “eua” are currently being administered across the country as further discussed below as of march 31 2021 nearly 154 million doses of covid19 vaccines have been administered in the us according to the cdc the full extent to which covid19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments which are described at the end of this covid19 section 

in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state and local government directives and policies have been put in place in the us to enhance availability of medications and supplies to meet the increased demand assist frontline healthcare providers manage public health concerns by creating social distancing and address the economic impacts including sharply reduced business activity increased unemployment and overall uncertainty presented by this healthcare emergency similar governmental actions have occurred in canada and europe the timing of which has varied across geographies in december 2020 the fda issued an eua for the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine manufactured by pfizer inc “pfizer vaccine” and the moderna covid19 vaccine manufactured by modernatx inc “moderna vaccine” to be distributed in the us these authorizations were followed by an eua for the janssen covid19 vaccine manufactured by janssen biotech inc a janssen pharmaceutical company of johnson  johnson “janssen vaccine” in february 2021 governmentcoordinated administrative or allocation decisions at the federal state and local levels may cause variability in the timing and volume of covid19 vaccine distribution and administration activities our role in the distribution of covid19 vaccines in the us as well as the assembly and distribution of related ancillary supply kits is discussed further below similar covid19 vaccine authorizations have occurred in canada and europe mckesson canada’s corporately owned retail pharmacy chain rexall as well as independent pharmacy banners are supporting canada’s vaccination efforts mckesson europe is also playing a role in helping support governments and public health entities in not only distributing covid19 vaccines across several european countries but administering them in pharmacies as well 

as a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions retail pharmacy community oncology and specialty care and healthcare information solutions we are well positioned to respond to the covid19 pandemic in the us canada and europe we have worked and continue to work closely with national and local governments agencies and industry partners to ensure that available supplies including personal protective equipment “ppe” and medicine reach our customers and patients

our response to covid19 in the workplace 

during this unprecedented time we are committed in continuing to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees the various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our business operations including telecommuting and workfromhome policies restricted travel employee support programs and enhanced safety measures are intended to limit employee exposure to the virus that causes covid19 we expanded employee medical benefits covering covid19 related visits treatments and testing as well as expanded telehealth options to protect employee safety we provided further support including additional emergency leave and an internal paid time off donation platform for employees impacted by covid19 for employees whose roles require presence at our facilities we enhanced safety by promoting the practice of social distancing providing reminders to wash or disinfect hands and avoid unnecessary face touching making face masks available placing hand sanitizers within our operating environments and periodically cleaning and disinfecting our facilities for employees whose roles do not require presence at our facilities we added technology resources to support their working remotely these responses were initially put in place during our fourth quarter of 2020 during the second quarter of 2021 we also implemented onsite workplace temperature screening as we continue to adapt our health and safety practices in response to the covid19 pandemic when working in frozen vaccine storage environments employees are provided with protective gear including special clothing gloves and facial gear these steps to protect employee safety have resulted in limited disruption from covid19 to our normal business operations productivity trends and have not materially impacted our operating expenses or operating margins 

we have evaluated the impact of our telecommuting and workfromhome policies on our system of internal controls and we have concluded that these policies did not have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended march 31 2021 we also took various actions to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our results from operations through costcontainment and payrollrelated expenses 

trends in our business 

at the onset of the covid19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter of 2020 we experienced higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes and increased retail pharmacy foot traffic as our customers increased supplies on hand in march which drove unfavorability in our results of operations when comparing 2021 versus 2020 

during the first quarter of 2021 we experienced growth in pharmaceutical distribution and specialty drug volumes at a lower rate in the us while pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased in europe and canada due to the covid19 pandemic as compared to the same prior year period specialty drug volumes increased but were negatively impacted by lower demand for elective specialty drugs as compared to the same prior year period we also experienced decreased demand for primary care medicalsurgical supplies due to deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic and closures of doctors’ offices which was partially offset by demand for ppe and covid19 tests additionally the decreased traffic in doctors’ offices and general shelterinplace guidance by governmental authorities negatively impacted retail pharmacy foot traffic in both europe and canada 

while we experienced improvements in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits during our second quarter of 2021 the impact and recovery of covid19 for the second half of our fiscal year was nonlinear and tracked with patient mobility we also saw increased demand for covid19 tests and continued sales of ppe throughout the year in our medicalsurgical solutions segment partially offset by the impacts of social distancing measures which resulted in a less severe cough cold and flu season savings for reduced travel and meetings across the enterprise as well as improvements of retail pharmacy foot traffic in europe and canada the vaccine and related ancillary kit distribution in the us favorably impacted our results in the second half of fiscal 2021 as further discussed below

our role in the distribution of covid19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits 

on august 14 2020 we expanded our contractual relationship with the cdc through an amendment to our existing vaccines for children program contract for the distribution of certain covid19 vaccines the covid19 vaccine distribution agreement with the cdc was finalized during the third quarter of 2021 we support the us government as a centralized distributor of covid19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines in the centralized model the us government directs us on the distribution of the vaccines and related supplies to pointofcare sites across the country we make no decisions on where products are to be distributed nor how the products are allocated between the various provider sites and ultimately administered to the individuals receiving a vaccine we utilize our expertise and capabilities to support the cdc’s efforts to vaccinate everyone in the us who wants to receive a covid19 vaccine the cdc and mckesson collaborated similarly in response to the 2009 h1n1 pandemic 

in december 2020 we began distributing the moderna vaccine in the us and in march 2021 we began distributing the janssen vaccine we may distribute other future authorized covid19 vaccines that are refrigerated or frozen ancillary supply kits may be shipped either together with the moderna vaccine and janssen vaccine or in advance of the vaccines the results of operations related to our vaccine distribution are reflected in our us pharmaceutical segment the pfizer vaccine which is ultrafrozen is not being distributed by mckesson although we are providing ancillary supplies needed for its administration 

on september 23 2020 we announced our contract with the hhs under which our medicalsurgical solutions segment manages the assembly and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer covid19 vaccines including sourcing some of those supplies we also have an agreement with pfizer to assemble and distribute ancillary supply kits needed to administer that particular covid19 vaccine ancillary supply kits include alcohol prep pads face shields surgical masks needles and syringes and other vaccine administration items for the pfizer vaccine ancillary supply kits also include the diluent needed to administer the ultrafrozen vaccine we began assembling the ancillary supply kits in september 2020 in preparation for vaccine authorization and subsequent distribution ancillary supply kits to administer the pfizer vaccine are shipped directly to pointofcare sites and all other ancillary supply kits are shipped to our dedicated vaccine distribution centers the results of operations for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies are reflected in our medicalsurgical solutions segment the future financial impact of the arrangements with the cdc and hhs depend on numerous uncertainties which are described at the end of this covid19 section 

to manage the covid19 vaccine and ancillary supply kit distribution we have set up special dedicated vaccine distribution centers that include largescale custom freezers and refrigerators to safely store and process millions of vaccine doses these facilities can scale to meet the demand of increasing volumes of vaccines being manufactured we have also set up distribution centers for kitting and inventory management as part of our contract with the hhs we are working with delivery partners to manage the delivery of vaccines and ancillary supply kits from our centralized vaccine distribution centers to pointofcare destinations as directed by the cdc the capital expenditures we made during 2021 to prepare for vaccine and ancillary supply kit distribution were not material to our financial condition or liquidity

impact to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

for the year ended march 31 2021 the demand for covid19 tests the year over year impact from ppe and other related products net of inventory charges as well as the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid19 vaccines in our medicalsurgical solutions segment contributed approximately 20 in segment revenues and segment operating profit additionally the distribution of covid19 vaccines in our us pharmaceutical segment contributed approximately 2 in segment operating profit for the year ended march 31 2021 during our fourth quarter of 2020 we experienced a temporary increase in demand for pharmaceuticals subsequently during the first quarter we had lower pharmaceutical volumes specialty drug volumes and patient care visits that negatively impacted our consolidated revenues and income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march 31 2021 during the year ended march 31 2021 selling distribution general and administrative expenses decreased as a result of the pandemic largely due to savings from restricted travel and decreased meetings the favorable reduction in selling distribution general and administrative expenses was partially offset by increased costs of transport costs for enhanced procedures to sanitize operating facilities and costs of providing ppe and other related products for employee use additionally increased costs for certain ppe compressed our margins certain ppe items held for resale were valued in our inventory at costs that were inflated by earlier covid19 pandemic demand levels that inventory valuation if not supported by market resale prices may be written down to net realizable value we may also writeoff inventory due to decreased customer demand and excess inventory during the year ended march 31 2021 we recorded charges totaling 136 million in cost of sales on certain ppe and other related products due to inventory impairments and excess inventory in our medicalsurgical solutions segment although market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand may require additional writedowns in future periods we are taking measures to mitigate such risk overall these covid19 related items had a net favorable impact on consolidated income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march 31 2021 compared to the prior year impacts to future periods due to covid19 may differ based on future developments which is described at the end of this covid19 section 

we were able to maintain appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels during the year ended march 31 2021 our inventory levels have fluctuated in response to supply availability and customer demand patterns for certain products with varying inventory level impacts depending on the specific product within our portfolio we collaborated closely with the federal government and other healthcare stakeholders to source more critical ppe to the us this collaboration expedited the shipment of critical medical supplies to areas hit hardest by covid19 as identified by the federal emergency management agency as our supply levels improve and the federal government evolves guidance on the prioritization of providers or geographic markets we will continue to adapt our distribution policies 

on march 27 2020 the us government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” to address the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic among other things the cares act provides certain changes to tax laws and includes provisions to provide relief for citizens companies healthcare providers and patients and others we have deferred certain employer payroll taxes and continue to monitor the potential impact of other tax legislation changes as result of the cares act including refundable payroll tax credits on certain qualified wages we anticipate changes due to the cares act in the timing of certain cash flows with no material impact to our financial results for the year ended march 31 2021 on december 27 2020 the us government enacted the consolidated appropriations act 2021 the “ca act” which enhances and expands certain provisions of the cares act the ca act did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for the year ended march 31 2021 nor do we currently expect a material impact on our future financial results 

our consolidated balance sheets and ability to maintain financial liquidity remains strong we have experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the covid19 pandemic we are monitoring our customers closely for changes to their timing of payments or ability to pay amounts owed to us as a result of covid19 pandemic impacts to their businesses we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility longterm debt markets and commercial paper markets our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations have remained open and accessible to us during the covid19 pandemic at march 31 2021 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future

impact to our supply chain 

we also continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic impacts on our supply chain although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers their locations and the extent to which they are impacted by the covid19 pandemic we are proactively working with manufacturers industry partners and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic we have assembled a critical care drug task force made up of our procurement specialists clinical health systems pharmacists and supply chain professionals that is focused on securing additional product where available sourcing backup products and protecting our operations across all locations and facilities we are also working with manufacturers through several channels including our clarusone sourcing services llp “clarusone” and global sourcing teams in london and our leaders are actively engaged in addressing potential shortages we have engaged with industry partners and government agencies to gain visibility into supply and demand additionally we have a robust business continuity and disaster recovery program “bcrp” and we have proactively enhanced our bcrp in response to the covid19 pandemic to protect the supply chain to minimize disruption in healthcare protect our customers ensure the safety and security of our employees and workplaces and ensure the continuity of critical business processes 

the situation remains fluid and we are taking a proactive approach to protect inventory during this crisis and ensure our provider partners have needed supplies and medications to help prevent the spread of the disease and treat those that are ill covid19 has put an unprecedented strain on the supply of highdemand ppe including n95 masks gloves as well as disinfecting sprays and wipes the supply chain has improved over the initial impact of pandemicrelated demand and we continue to closely monitor demand by customer type and certain ppe and infection prevention items are still in short supply our allocation approach has helped us avoid stock outs in many critical product categories allowing us to provide ppe supplies to many more customers for a much longer time we anticipate these market conditions will remain for the foreseeable future our efforts to help the supply chain have included sourcing products from new suppliers all over the world working closely with the federal government to help with the nation’s response and collaborating with partners to source develop and deliver new products to market 

risks and forwardlooking information 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates judgments and assumptions used in our forecasts we face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects of covid19 on our future business operations financial condition results of operations and liquidity the full extent to which covid19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments including the duration and spread of the virus governmental actions to limit the spread of the virus potential seasonality of viral outbreaks potential new strains or variants of the original virus the amount of covid19 vaccines authorized manufactured distributed and administered the amount of ancillary supply kits assembled and distributed the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and governmental measures in controlling the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of treatments of infected individuals due to several rapidly changing variables related to the covid19 pandemic estimations of future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return remains challenging additionally we periodically review our intangible and other longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable key assumptions and estimates about future values in our impairment assessments can be affected by a variety of factors including the impacts of the global pandemic on industry and economic trends as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts material changes to key assumptions and estimates can decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and have resulted in impairment charges of certain longlived assets as disclosed in financial note 4 “restructuring impairment and related charges” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and could potentially result in future impairment charges refer to item 1a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form 10k for a disclosure of risk factors related to covid19

opioidrelated litigation and claims 

we are a defendant in approximately 3200 legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances opioids in federal and state courts throughout the us and in puerto rico and canada those proceedings include approximately 2900 federal cases and approximately 300 state court cases throughout the us and cases in puerto rico and canada we continue to be involved in discussions with the objective of achieving broad resolution of opioidrelated claims of states their political subdivisions and other government entities “governmental entities” we are in ongoing advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework under which in order to resolve the claims of governmental entities the three largest us pharmaceutical distributors would pay up to approximately 210 billion over a period of 18 years with up to approximately 80 billion to be paid by us of which more than 90 is anticipated to be used to remediate the opioids crisis most of the remaining amount relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and costs and would be payable over a shorter time period in addition the proposed framework would require the three distributors including the company to adopt changes to antidiversion programs 

we have concluded that discussions under that framework have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable and the loss related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of march 31 2021 as a result of that conclusion and our assessment of certain other opioidrelated claims we recorded a charge of 81 billion for the year ended march 31 2021 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations related to our share of the settlement framework described above as well as other opioidrelated claims because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioidrelated litigation including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioidrelated litigation matters in light of the uncertainty of the timing of amounts that would be paid with respect to the charge the charge was recorded in “longterm litigation liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31 2021 moreover in light of this uncertainty the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued 

while we continue to be involved in discussions regarding a potential broad settlement framework we also continue to prepare for trial in these pending matters we believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and absent an acceptable settlement intend to vigorously defend against all such claims an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position cash flows or liquidity or results of operations refer to financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information 

state opioid statutes 

legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict in april 2018 the state of new york adopted the opioid stewardship act “osa” which required the imposition of an annual surcharge on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in new york on december 19 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york found the law unconstitutional and issued an injunction preventing the state of new york from enforcing the law the state of new york appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit the state of new york has subsequently adopted an excise tax on sales of opioids in the state which became effective july 1 2019 the law adopting the excise tax made clear that the osa would apply only to opioid sales on or before december 31 2018 the excise tax applies only to the first sale occurring in new york and thus may not apply to sales from our distribution centers in new york to new york customers 

on september 14 2020 a panel of the us court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district court’s decision on procedural grounds the healthcare distribution alliance filed a petition for panel rehearing or in the alternative for rehearing en banc with the us court of appeals for the second circuit that petition was denied on december 18 2020 on february 12 2021 the us court of appeals for the second circuit granted a motion by the healthcare distribution alliance to stay its mandate pending the filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari before the us supreme court the due date for filing such a petition is may 17 2021 unless the appellate court’s decision is overturned the osa will be reinstated for calendar years 2017 and 2018 but not beyond those years and subject to any further legal challenge we will have to pay our ratable share of the annual surcharge for those two years during the second quarter of 2021 we reflected an estimated liability of 50 million for the osa surcharge in our accompanying consolidated financial statements on the assumption that the appellate court’s decision will stand refer to note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information

revenues 

revenues increased for the years ended march 31 2021 and 2020 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to market growth including expanded business with existing customers within our us pharmaceutical segment market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion 

gross profit 

gross profit increased for the year ended march 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily in our medicalsurgical solutions segment driven by the demand for covid19 tests and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid19 vaccines partially offset by the unfavorable impact from ppe and other related products largely due to inventory charges gross profit was favorably impacted by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and the contribution from our vaccine distribution programs in our us pharmaceutical segment gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the adverse impacts from covid19 largely during the first quarter of 2021 including disruptions of doctors’ office operations deferred or cancelled elective procedures lower demand for pharmaceuticals and overall reduction of foot traffic in pharmacies 

gross profit increased for the year ended march 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth in our medicalsurgical solutions segment partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations gross profit and gross profit margin for the year ended march 31 2020 compared to the prior year were unfavorably impacted by lower gains from antitrust legal settlements partially offset by higher lastin firstout “lifo” credits in 2020 the impact from covid19 increased gross profit by less than 1 and decreased gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points for the year ended march 31 2020 

gross profit for the years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 included lifo inventory credits of 38 million 252 million and 210 million respectively the lower lifo credits in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded offpatent to generic drug launches the higher lifo credits in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by higher generic deflation refer to the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this financial review for further information gross profit for the years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 also included net cash proceeds received of 181 million 22 million and 202 million respectively representing our share of antitrust legal settlements

• claims and litigation charges net includes a settlement charge of 82 million recorded in connection with an agreement to settle all opioidrelated claims filed by two ohio counties 

• restructuring impairment and related charges net includes longlived asset impairment charges of 112 million primarily for our united kingdom “uk” business mainly pharmacy licenses and rexall health retail business “rexall health” mainly customer relationships within our international segment and the remaining 156 million primarily represents employee severance and exitrelated costs related to our 2019 restructuring initiatives as further discussed below and 

• total operating expenses includes higher sdga due to our business acquisitions and to support business growth as well as our technology initiatives partially offset by favorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 

• sdga includes opioidrelated costs of 114 million primarily related to litigation expenses and increased expenses due to our business acquisitions and to support growth partially offset by a gain from an escrow settlement of 97 million representing certain indemnity and other claims related to our 2017 acquisition of rexall health and a credit of 90 million for the derecognition of a liability related to the tax receivable agreement “tra” payable to the shareholders of change healthcare inc “change” 

• goodwill impairment charges of 18 billion in our european retail pharmacy “european rp” and european pharmaceutical distribution “european pd” reporting units within the international segment of these impairment charges 238 million was recognized upon the 2019 first quarter segment changes which resulted in two new reporting units the remaining charges primarily were due to declines in the reporting units’ estimated future cash flows and the selection of higher discount rates these impairment charges generally were not deductible for income tax purposes the declines in estimated future cash flows primarily were attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures within the uk the risk of successfully achieving certain business initiatives was the primary factor in the use of a higher discount rate at march 31 2019 both the european rp and european pd reporting units had no remaining goodwill balances and 

• restructuring impairment and related charges net primarily includes employee severance and exitrelated costs of 352 million for our 2019 restructuring initiatives as further discussed below and longlived asset impairment charges of 245 million primarily for our uk business mainly pharmacy licenses within our international segment driven by additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the uk 

goodwill impairments 

as discussed in the “overview of our business” section our operating structure was realigned commencing in the second quarter of 2021 into four reportable segments us pharmaceutical international medicalsurgical solutions and rxts these reportable segments encompass all operating segments of the company the second quarter segment realignment resulted in changes in multiple reporting units across the company as a result we were required to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units and recorded a goodwill impairment charge in our european rp reporting unit of 69 million during the second quarter of 2021 at march 31 2021 the balance of goodwill for our reporting units in europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the international segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in canada 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 and at an interim date if indicators of potential impairment exist the annual impairment testing performed in 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill as of the testing date other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods including our mckesson canada reporting unit within our international segment and our rxcrossroads reporting unit within our rxts segment where the risk of a material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units refer to “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review for further information 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

on october 1 2019 we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from january 1 to october 1 to better align with the timing of our annual longterm planning process this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge refer to note 12 “goodwill and intangible assets net” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

restructuring initiatives and longlived asset impairments 

during the first quarter of 2022 we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees this initiative primarily led us to rationalize our office space in north america where we determine to cease using office space we plan to exit the portion of the facility no longer used we also may retain and repurpose certain other office locations we expect to incur total charges of approximately 180 million to 280 million for this initiative consisting primarily of exit related costs accelerated depreciation and amortization of longlived assets and asset impairments this initiative is expected to be completed in 2022 

during the first quarter of 2021 we committed to an initiative within the uk which is included in our international segment to further drive transformational changes in technologies and business processes operational efficiencies and cost savings the initiative includes reducing the number of retail pharmacy stores decommissioning obsolete technologies and processes reorganizing and consolidating certain business operations and related headcount reductions we expect to incur total charges of approximately 85 million to 90 million of which 57 million of charges were recorded to date the initiative is expected to be substantially complete in 2022 and estimated remaining charges primarily consist of accelerated amortization of longlived assets facility and other exit costs and employeerelated costs 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we committed to certain programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts we continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through an expanded arrangement with a thirdparty vendor to achieve operational efficiency the programs also include reorganization and consolidation of business operations related headcount reductions the further closures of retail pharmacy stores in europe and closures of other facilities total charges of 297 million were recorded to date this initiative was substantially complete in 2021 and remaining costs we expect to record under this initiative are not material 

we also committed to certain actions in connection with the previously announced relocation of our corporate headquarters from san francisco california to irving texas which became effective april 1 2019 total charges of 105 million were recorded to date the relocation was substantially complete in january 2021 and remaining costs we expect to record under this initiative primarily relating to lease costs are not material 

in the second quarter of 2018 we committed to a restructuring plan which primarily consisted of the closures of underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the uk and a reduction in workforce the plan was substantially complete in 2020 

on april 25 2018 we announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive longterm incremental profit growth and to increase operational efficiency the initiative consisted of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize our operating models and cost structures primarily through centralization cost management and outsourcing of certain administrative functions as part of the growth initiative we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce facility consolidation and store closures this set of initiatives was substantially complete by the end of 2020 

restructuring impairment and related charges for the years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 also includes longlived asset impairment charges of 115 million 112 million and 245 million respectively primarily related to our retail pharmacy businesses in canada and europe within our international segment in addition certain charges related to restructuring initiatives are included under the caption “cost of sales” in our consolidated statements of operations and were not material for the years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019

other income net 

other income net for the year ended march 31 2021 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to net gains recognized from our equity investments of 133 million this primarily reflects marktomarket gains on our investments in certain us growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and realized gains on the exit of some of these investments as further described in financial note 17 “fair value measurements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in future periods fair value adjustments recognized in our operating results for these types of investments may be adversely impacted by market volatility other income net also increased year over year due to pension settlement charges of 122 million recognized in 2020 related to our previously approved termination of the frozen us defined benefit pension plan in connection with the pension plan termination we purchased annuity contracts from an insurer that will pay and administer the future pension benefits of the remaining participants 

other income net for the year ended march 31 2020 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2020 pension settlement charges described above and higher gains recognized from the sale of investments in 2019 partially offset by higher net settlement gains in 2020 from our derivative contracts 

equity earnings and charges from investment in change healthcare joint venture 

until the separation of our investment in change healthcare jv on march 10 2020 we accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting excluding the impairment and transactionrelated items described below our proportionate share of loss from our investment in change healthcare jv for the years ended march 31 2020 and 2019 was 119 million and 194 million respectively which primarily includes transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and basis differences between the joint venture and mckesson including amortization of fair value adjustments during the first quarter of 2020 and for the year ended march 31 2019 we owned approximately 70 of this joint venture 

on june 27 2019 common stock and certain other securities of change began trading on the nasdaq “ipo” on july 1 2019 upon the completion of its ipo change contributed net cash proceeds it received from its offering of common stock to change healthcare jv in exchange for additional membership interests of change healthcare jv at the equivalent of its offering price of 13 per share the proceeds from the concurrent offering of other securities were also used by change to acquire certain securities of change healthcare jv as a result mckesson’s equity interest in change healthcare jv was reduced from 70 to approximately 585 which was used to recognize our proportionate share in net loss from change healthcare jv commencing in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the ownership dilution to 585 from 70 we recognized a dilution loss of approximately 246 million in the second quarter of 2020 additionally our proportionate share of income or loss from this investment was subsequently reduced as immaterial settlements of stock option exercises occurred after the ipo and further diluted our ownership 

in the second quarter of 2020 we recorded an otherthantemporaryimpairment “otti” charge of 12 billion to our investment in change healthcare jv representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the fair value derived from the corresponding closing price of change’s common stock at september 30 2019 this charge was included within “equity earnings and charges from investment in change healthcare joint venture” in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march 31 2020 

on march 10 2020 we completed the previously announced separation of our interest in change healthcare jv which eliminated our investment in the joint venture the separation was effected through the splitoff of pf2 spinco inc “spinco” a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that held all of our interest in change healthcare jv to certain of our stockholders through an exchange offer “splitoff” followed by the merger of spinco with and into change with change surviving the merger “merger”

financial review continued 

in connection with the exchange offer on march 9 2020 we distributed all 1760 million outstanding shares of common stock of spinco to participating holders of the company’s common stock in exchange for 154 million shares of mckesson common stock following consummation of the exchange offer on march 10 2020 the merger was consummated with each share of spinco common stock converted into one share of change common stock par value 0001 per share with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of change common stock the splitoff and merger are intended to be generally taxfree transactions to mckesson and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes following the splitoff we do not beneficially own any of change’s outstanding securities in connection with this transaction we recognized a net gain for financial reporting purposes of 414 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 which was largely driven by the reversal of a related deferred tax liability under the agreement with change healthcare jv mckesson change and certain subsidiaries of the change healthcare jv there may be changes in future periods to the amount reversed any such change is not expected to be material 

after the separation change healthcare jv is required under the tra to pay mckesson 85 of the net cash tax savings realized or deemed to be realized resulting from depreciation or amortization allocated to change by mckesson the receipt of any payments under the tra is dependent upon change benefiting from this depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings which creates uncertainty over the amount timing and probability of the gain recognized as such we accounted for the tra as a gain contingency with no receivable recognized as of march 31 2021 nor 2020 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to the repayment of 10 billion of longterm debt in the third quarter of 2021 and a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our derivative contracts interest expense fluctuates based on timing amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees 

income tax benefit expense 

we recorded income tax benefit expense of 695 million 18 million and 356 million for the years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our reported income tax benefit expense rates were 138 16 and 584 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

our reported income tax rate for 2021 was impacted by the charge for opioidrelated claims of 81 billion 68 billion aftertax 

our reported income tax expense rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by a net gain on the change healthcare jv divestiture of 414 million pretax and aftertax which was intended to generally be a taxfree splitoff for us federal income tax purposes and unfavorably impacted by charges of 275 million pretax and aftertax to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell related to the completed contribution of the majority of our german pharmaceutical wholesale business to create a joint venture with wba refer to financial note 2“investment in change healthcare joint venture” and note 3“held for sale” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information 

our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by charges of 18 billion pretax and aftertax to impair the carrying value of goodwill of our european rp and european pd reporting units within the international segment given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes refer to financial note 12 “goodwill and intangible assets net” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties although our major taxing jurisdictions include the us canada and the uk we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

the company considers historical experience the current economic environment customer credit ratings or bankruptcies and reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for doubtful accounts management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance

sales to the company’s ten largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 51 of total consolidated revenues in 2021 and comprised approximately 32 of total trade accounts receivable at march 31 2021 sales to our largest customer cvs health corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 21 of our total consolidated revenues in 2021 and comprised approximately 19 of total trade accounts receivable at march 31 2021 as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2021 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed as well as assessment of trends currently available 

at march 31 2021 trade and notes receivables were 175 billion prior to allowances of 211 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 our provision for bad debts was 4 million 91 million and 132 million respectively at march 31 2021 and 2020 the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 12 and 14 respectively an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2021 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 18 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worstcase scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories inventories consist of merchandise held for resale we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value except for inventories determined using the lifo method which are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under lifo approximates market the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the firstin firstout “fifo” method and weightedaverage purchase prices rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold 

at march 31 2021 and 2020 total inventories net were 192 billion and 167 billion respectively in our consolidated balance sheets the lifo method was used to value approximately 58 and 60 of our inventories at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively if we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation inventories would have been approximately 406 million and 444 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves the lower lifo credits in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded offpatent to generic drug launches our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products we recognized lifo credits of 38 million 252 million and 210 million respectively in 2021 2020 and 2019 in our consolidated statements of operations a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory excluding lifo reserves our inventory reserves as of march 31 2021 and 2020 were 263 million and 96 million respectively the increase was primarily due to 2021 charges totaling 136 million on certain ppe and other related products due to inventory impairments and excess inventory within our medicalsurgical solutions segment 

we believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2021 and 2020 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

in determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that the company obtains control of the acquired business any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a riskadjusted discount rate some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life refer to financial note 5 “business acquisitions and divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and longlived assets as a result of acquiring businesses we have 95 billion and 94 billion of goodwill at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and 29 billion and 32 billion of intangible assets net at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

we apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and recording an impairment charge equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value if any but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge under the market approach significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit under the income approach significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates the discount rates represent the weightedaverage cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure included in the estimate of the weightedaverage cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections an increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate 

based on the 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests the estimated fair values of our reporting units excluding the europe retail pharmacy and europe pharmaceutical distribution reporting units in our international segment exceeded their carrying values the impairment testing performed in 2020 did not indicate any material impairment of goodwill the segment change in the second quarter of 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the company as a result goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 69 million in 2021 as the estimated fair value of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit within the international segment at march 31 2021 the balance of goodwill for the reporting units in europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the international segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in canada 

the estimated fair values of our mckesson canada reporting unit in our international segment and our rxcrossroads reporting unit in our rxts segment exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units by 11 and 14 respectively in 2021 the goodwill balance of these reporting units was 15 billion for mckesson canada and 312 million for rxcrossroads at march 31 2021 or approximately 19 of the consolidated goodwill balance generally a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 16 for mckesson canada and 17 for rxcrossroads or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 15 could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for these reporting units in future reporting periods other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods refer to financial note 12 “goodwill and intangible assets net” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

currently all of our intangible and other longlived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 38 years we review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 

our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income refer to financial note 4 “restructuring impairment and related charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

valuation of equity method investments we evaluate our investments for otherthantemporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired when the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment we consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost the financial condition of the investees and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary expectations about the business operations of investees as well as industry financial and market factors any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge 

restructuring charges we have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exitrelated costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place we generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the ceaseuse dates other exitrelated costs are recognized as incurred in connection with these restructuring actions we also assess the recoverability of longlived assets used in the business and as a result we may recognize accelerated depreciation and amortization reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties and include those used to conclude on the taxfree nature of the separation of the change healthcare jv and the unrecognized tax position related to opioidrelated litigation and claims which remains unfinalized and which may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations 

we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties in conjunction with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party as a result of ongoing advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework to resolve the claims of governmental entities and our assessment of certain other opioidrelated claims we have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable and recorded a charge of 81 billion for the year ended march 31 2021 within “claims and litigation charges net” in our consolidated statement of operations in this report because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioidrelated litigation including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioidrelated litigation matters while we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations consolidated financial position cash flows or liquidity refer to financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund our shortterm and longterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements as described within the “trends and uncertainties” section above the covid19 pandemic continues to develop rapidly we continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our 40 billion revolving credit facility additionally longterm debt markets and commercial paper markets our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations have remained open and accessible to us during the covid19 pandemic we have seen continued improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the federal reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets at march 31 2021 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future

3 8 million was accrued within “other accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31 2021 for share repurchases that were executed in late march and settled in early april 

during the last three years our share repurchases were transacted through both open market transactions and asr programs with third party financial institutions 

in 2019 we retired 50 million or 542 million of the company’s treasury shares previously repurchased under the applicable state law these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement in accordance with our accounting policy we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings accordingly our retained earnings and additional paidin capital were reduced by 472 million and 70 million during 2019 respectively 

on march 9 2020 we completed the splitoff of our interest in the change healthcare jv in connection with the splitoff we distributed all 1760 million outstanding shares of spinco common stock which held all of the company’s interests in the change healthcare jv to participating holders of the company’s common stock in exchange for 154 million shares of mckesson stock which are now held as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet following consummation of the exchange offer on march 10 2020 spinco merged with and into change and each share of spinco common stock was converted into one share of change common stock par value 0001 per share with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of change common stock see note 2 “investment in change healthcare joint venture” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

the total authorization outstanding for repurchase of the company’s common stock was 28 billion at march 31 2021 

we believe that our future operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing as described within the “trends and uncertainties” section above the covid19 pandemic continues to develop rapidly we continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us

cash equivalents which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash are carried at fair value cash equivalents are primarily invested in aaarated us government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2021 and 2020 included approximately 23 billion and 17 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the us respectively our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the us is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes following enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the repatriation of cash to the us is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt and other current liabilities our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements the covid19 pandemic has potential to increase the variations in our working capital which we continue to monitor closely 

consolidated working capital improved at march 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable and the current portion of longterm debt for term notes due in 2021 partially offset by an increase in receivables and cash and cash equivalents 

our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended march 31 2021 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by net loss for the year and share repurchases our unfavorable return on mckesson’s stockholder’s equity deficit as of march 31 2021 was also driven by net loss for the year net loss for the year ended march 31 2021 includes an aftertax noncash charge of 68 billion related to our estimated liability for opioidrelated claims as discussed in “trends and uncertainties” of this financial review and financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k our debt to capital ratio increased for 2020 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by the splitoff of our interest in change healthcare jv and share repurchases

the contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations 

at march 31 2021 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 738 million additionally any future payments that may be made related to our estimated litigation liability of 81 billion for opioidrelated claims as described in the “trends and uncertainties” section in this financial review and financial note 19 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are excluded the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements related to these items cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty 

our banks and insurance companies have issued 146 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at march 31 2021 these were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs 

our redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily relate to our consolidated subsidiary mckesson europe under the domination agreement the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe have a right to put “put right” their shares at €2299 per share increased annually for interest in the amount of five percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the german bundesbank less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid by mckesson “put amount” the exercise of the put right will reduce the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests during 2021 we paid 49 million to purchase 18 million shares of mckesson europe through exercises of the put right by the noncontrolling shareholders during 2020 and 2019 there were no material exercises of the put right 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is also adjusted each period for the portion of other comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling shareholders which is primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at march 31 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to mckesson europe of 13 billion and 14 billion respectively exceeded the maximum redemption value of 12 billion in future periods unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar could adversely impact the carrying value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests and require an adjustment to increase the balance of our redeemable noncontrolling interests to its maximum redemption value such adjustments would be recorded in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of operations 

additionally we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €083 per mckesson europe share the “compensation amount” to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe under the domination agreement the compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period the domination agreement does not expire but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six month’s advance notice the put amount compensation amount and the guaranteed dividend were subject to ongoing appraisal proceedings on april 12 2021 we received the stuttgart court of appeals’ final ruling confirming the original put value of €2299 per share and the annual recurring compensation of €083 per mckesson europe share the put right exercise window will expire on june 15 2021 while the ultimate amount of any future cash payments related to exercises of the put right are uncertain put right exercises could result in cash payments of up to approximately 13 billion prior to the expiration of the put right

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2021 and 2020 we had 63 billion and 40 billion respectively in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2021 and 2020 of approximately 17 million and 6 million respectively 

mckesson corporation 

financial review concluded 

foreign exchange risk we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps the forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps are intended to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2021 and 2020 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 267 million and 435 million respectively however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 16 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

customers during 2020  sales to our ten largest customers including gpos accounted for approximately 51 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 20 of our total consolidated revenues in 2020  in may 2019 we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with cvs to june 2023 our ten largest customers comprised approximately 37  and cvs was approximately 20  of total trade accounts receivable at march 31 2020  we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 6 of our purchases in 2020  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound the ten largest suppliers in 2020 accounted for approximately 44 of our purchases 

some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development research and development “rd” expenses were 96 million  71 million and 125 million during 2020  2019 and 2018  rd costs were higher in 2018 prior to the sale of our enterprise information solutions “eis” business

mckesson corporation 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations presently are not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2020 and is not expected to be material in the next year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the discussion below identifies certain representative risks that might cause our actual business results to materially differ from our estimates it is not practical to identify or describe all risks and uncertainties that might materially impact our business operations reputation financial position or results of operations our business could be materially affected by risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider to be immaterial this is not a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 

litigation and regulatory risks 

we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 

we are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes which may include asserted class action litigation such as those described in financial note 21  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” to the consolidated financial statements in this report regulatory proceedings might involve allegations such as false claims healthcare fraud and abuse and antitrust violations civil litigation proceedings might involve commercial employment environmental intellectual property tort and other claims despite valid defenses that we assert legal disputes are often costly timeconsuming distracting to management and disruptive to normal business operations the outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict outcomes can occur that are not justified by the evidence or existing law the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter is favorably resolved accordingly any legal dispute might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might experience losses not covered by insurance 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans for example pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions mislabeling of prescriptions inadequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable or coverages might not cover our losses we generally seek to limit our contractual exposure but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability uninsured losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we experience costly legal disputes government actions and adverse publicity regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids 

the company is a defendant in over 3000 cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances opioids as described in financial note 21  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” to the consolidated financial statements in this report we regularly are named as a defendant in similar new cases the plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities such as states provinces counties and municipalities as well as businesses groups and individuals the cases allege violations of controlled substance laws and other laws and they make common law claims such as negligence and public nuisance many of these cases raise novel theories of liability any proceedings can have unexpected outcomes that are not justified by evidence or existing law all proceedings involve significant expense management time and distraction and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify it is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years proceedings can result in monetary damages penalties and fines and injunctive or other relief although the company has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself some proceedings are resolved by negotiated outcome our reputation is impacted by publicity regarding the impacts of opioid use the adverse outcome of legal proceedings might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might experience increased costs to distribute controlled substances such as opioids 

legislative regulatory or industry measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict for example some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation liabilities for taxes or assessments or other costs of compliance under any such laws might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we are subject to extensive complex and challenging healthcare and other laws 

our industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations for example we are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations including those relating to radiationemitting equipment operated at us oncology network practices any noncompliance by us with applicable laws or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse 

local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose many restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of these laws including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations failures to comply with applicable laws subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs these sanctions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might lose our ability to purchase compound store or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances 

we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments hhs the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding distribution and disposal of controlled substances noncompliance with these requirements has resulted in monetary penalties andor licensing sanctions for example under a january 2017 agreement with the dea and department of justice we paid 150 million to settle potential administrative and civil claims about our practices for reporting suspicious orders of controlled substances and the dea suspended on a staggered basis for limited periods of time our registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four distribution centers as of march 31 2020 one dea registration was in suspension and three were expired if we are not able to obtain maintain or renew permits licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs 

there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking for example the us drug quality and security act of 2013 “dqsa” requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements and the us food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies such as track and trace or authentication technologies to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs we also have recordkeeping and other obligations under the eu falsified medicines directive pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and they might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

industry and economic risks 

we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models 

many of our products and services are designed and intended to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems the healthcare industry and related government programs are changing significantly as they seek to increase efficiencies reduce costs and improve patient outcomes these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business 

for example reimbursement methodologies including government rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models and increases in the use of managed care 

in the us the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers there are continued efforts to challenge the aca there are also efforts to broaden healthcare coverage us lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures these proposals might result in significant changes in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers pbm managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models 

provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers 

many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending these measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices 

although there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood timing and results of these health reform efforts their implementation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states at the federal state and local government levels and to the tax laws of many other jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate and cash flow the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges and we might be unsuccessful those efforts developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by the brexit withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union 

we have operations in the uk and the european union “eu” and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions that might follow the united kingdom withdrawing from the european union “brexit” brexit could adversely affect political regulatory economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets for example we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our uk operations customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by brexit any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state and local government directives and policies have been put in place in the united states to enhance availability of medications and supplies to meet the increased demand assist frontline healthcare providers manage public health concerns by creating social distancing and address the economic impacts including sharply reduced business activity increased unemployment and overall uncertainty presented by this new healthcare challenge similar governmental actions have occurred in canada and europe 

as a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions retail pharmacy community oncology and specialty care and healthcare information technology we are uniquely positioned to respond to the covid19 pandemic in the united states canada and europe we are working closely with national and local governments agencies and industry partners to ensure supplies including personal protective equipment and medicine reach our customers and patients when they need them

financial review continued 

we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that we continue to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees the various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of covid19 on our business operations including telecommuting and workfromhome policies restricted travel requirements employee support programs and enhanced safety measures are intended to limit exposure to covid19 these successful steps in our fourth quarter of 2020 have resulted in limited disruption of our normal business operations productivity trends and slightly compressed operating margins due to increased operating expenses 

the financial impact to the year ended march 31 2020 is muted due to the timing of the covid19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter we experienced higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in march however these increases were partially offset by decreases in specialty drug volumes and decreased demand within primary care medicalsurgical supplies specialty drug volumes were negatively impacted by lower demand for infusions elective specialty drugs oncology and dermatology practice sales demand for primary care medicalsurgical supplies were negatively impacted by deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic or closures in doctor’s offices these positive and negative covid19 impacts drove increased consolidated revenues by less than 1 in 2020 

the increased volumes and revenue due to covid19 favorably impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes but were mostly offset by increased variable labor costs enhanced sterilization procedures to sanitize operating facilities costs of personal protection equipment for our employees and increased costs of transport as well as increased other operating expenses additionally as previously mentioned decreased specialty drug volumes and demand challenges for primary care medicalsurgical supplies weighed negatively on income from continuing operations before income taxes we also expanded temporary employee benefits and incentives targeted for our frontline employees to not only protect their safety but to provide further support including additional medical benefits emergency leave as well as added compensation the overall impact to income from continuing operations before income taxes from the favorable and unfavorable items mentioned above largely offset each other however impacts to future periods due to covid19 may differ based on future developments including the duration and spread of the virus as well as potential seasonality of new outbreaks overall operating margins were compressed due to higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes shifts in product mix higher demand by retail national accounts and increased operating expenses 

our consolidated balance sheets and ability to maintain financial liquidity remains strong we have experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital with many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to the covid19 pandemic we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility longterm debt markets and commercial paper markets our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations have remained open during the covid19 pandemic while there are signs of stress in both markets we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any nearterm liquidity needs we have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the federal reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets we believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements 

we continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic impact on our supply chain we were able to maintain appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels under the circumstances in the fourth quarter despite challenges including higher sickness rates and service level issues with suppliers supplier shortages and stockouts for certain products have occurred in specific instances as demand in excess of supply escalated for certain items tied to the covid19 pandemic response such as personal protective equipment and other preventive products our inventory levels have fluctuated in response to these supply dynamics and increased concentrated customer orders for certain products with varying inventory level impacts depending on the specific product within our portfolio of offerings 

although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers their location and the extent to which they are impacted by the covid19 pandemic we are proactively working with manufacturers industry partners and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic we have assembled a critical care drug task force made up of our procurement specialists clinical health systems pharmacists and supply chain professionals focused on securing additional product where available sourcing backup products adjusting allocations to ensure equitable distribution and to protect our operations across all locations and facilities we have a robust business continuity and disaster recovery program “bcrp” and we have proactively enhanced our bcrp in response to the covid19 pandemic

the covid19 pandemic impacted our business operations and financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 although the financial impact on our overall 2020 results is limited due to the timing of the outbreak we face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our future business operations financial condition results of operations and liquidity additionally responses from authorities and regulators at all levels of government may materially impact us in future periods due to several rapidly changing variables related to the covid19 pandemic we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return refer to item 1a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form 10k for a disclosure of risk factors related to covid19 

opioidrelated litigation and claims 

we are a defendant in over 3000 legal proceedings asserting claims related to distribution of controlled substances opioids in federal and state courts throughout the united states and in puerto rico and canada we are vigorously defending ourselves against such claims and proceedings and are a party to discussions with the objective of achieving broad resolution of the remaining claims because of the large number of parties involved together with the novelty and complexity of the issues for which there may be different considerations among the parties we cannot predict the successful resolution through a negotiated settlement an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position cash flows or liquidity or results of operations refer to financial note 21  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information

revenues 

revenues increased for the years ended march 31 2020 and 2019 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to market growth including expanded business with existing customers within our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion the increase in revenues for 2019 was also due to our 2019 first quarter acquisition of medical specialties distributors llc “msd” partially offset by loss of customers within our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment the impact from covid19 increased revenues by less than 1 for the year ended march 31 2020 and was primarily attributable to our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions and european pharmaceutical solutions segments 

gross profit 

gross profit increased for the year ended march 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth in our medicalsurgical solutions segment partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations gross profit and gross profit margin for the year ended march 31 2020 compared to the prior year were unfavorably impacted by a decrease in net cash proceeds received of 22 million in 2020 compared to 202 million in 2019 representing our share of antitrust legal settlements partially offset by higher lastin firstout “lifo” credits in 2020 due to higher generic deflation the impact from covid19 increased gross profit by less than 1 and decreased gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points for the year ended march 31 2020  

gross profit and gross profit margin increased for the year ended march 31 2019 compared to the prior year gross profit increased due to market growth partially offset by loss of customers the increase in gross profit and gross profit margin for 2019 was also due to the receipt of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements of 202 million  higher lifo credits and our business acquisitions these increases in 2019 were partially offset by the incremental government reimbursement reductions in the united kingdom “uk” government imposed generic price cuts in canada and the 2018 third quarter sale of our enterprise information solutions “eis” business 

gross profit for the years ended march 31 2020  2019 and 2018 included lifo inventory credits of 252 million  210 million and 99 million  refer to the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this financial review for further information

 goodwill impairments 

the impairment testing performed in 2020 did not indicate any material impairment of goodwill as of the testing date other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods including our mckesson canada reporting unit in other where the risk of a material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units refer to “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review for further information 

on october 1 2019 we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from january 1 to october 1 to better align with the timing of our annual longterm planning process this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge refer to note 14  “ goodwill and intangible assets net ” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

2019 restructuring initiatives 

on april 25 2018 we announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive longterm incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency the initiative consists of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize our operating models and cost structures primarily through the centralization cost management and outsourcing of certain administrative functions as part of the growth initiative we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce facility consolidation and store closures this set of the initiatives was substantially complete by the end of 2020 and we recorded charges of 15 million and 135 million in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee severance exitrelated costs and asset impairment charges any remaining charges primarily consist of exitrelated costs 

as previously announced on november 30 2018 we relocated our corporate headquarters from san francisco california to irving texas to improve efficiency collaboration and cost competitiveness effective april 1 2019 we anticipate that the relocation will be complete by january 2021 we expect to incur total charges of approximately 80 million to 130 million  of which charges of 44 million and 33 million were recorded in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee retention expenses asset impairments and accelerated depreciation the estimated remaining charges primarily consist of lease and other exitrelated costs and employeerelated expenses including retention 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we committed to additional programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts we continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through the expanded arrangement with a thirdparty vendor to achieve operational efficiency the programs also include reorganization and consolidation of our business operations and related headcount reductions closures of retail pharmacy stores in europe and closures of other facilities we anticipate these additional programs will be substantially complete by the end of 2021 we expect to incur total charges of approximately 300 million to 350 million for these programs of which charges of 72 million and 163 million were recorded in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee severance accelerated depreciation expense and project consulting fees the estimated remaining charges primarily consist of facility and other exit costs and employeerelated costs

other income net 

other income net for the year ended march 31 2020 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2020 pension settlement charges of 122 million related to our previously approved termination of the frozen us defined benefit pension plan and higher gains recognized from the sale of investments in 2019 partially offset by higher settlement gains in 2020 from our derivative contracts in connection with the pension plan termination we purchased annuity contracts from an insurer that will pay and administer the future pension benefits of the remaining participants 

other income net for the year ended march 31 2019 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains recognized from the sales of investments 

equity earnings and charges from investment in change healthcare joint venture 

our investment in change healthcare jv is accounted for using the equity method of accounting excluding the impairment and transactionrelated items described below our proportionate share of loss from our investment in change healthcare jv for the years ended march 31 2020  2019 and 2018 was 119 million  194 million and 248 million  which primarily includes transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and basis differences between the joint venture and mckesson including amortization of fair value adjustments 2018 also includes certain transaction expenses partially offset by a tax benefit of 76 million primarily due to a reduction in the future applicable tax rate related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” during the first quarter of 2020 and for the years ended march 31 2019 and 2018  we owned approximately 70 of this joint venture 

on june 27 2019 common stock and certain other securities of change began trading on the nasdaq “ipo” on july 1 2019 upon the completion of its ipo change contributed net cash proceeds it received from its offering of common stock to change healthcare jv in exchange for additional membership interests of change healthcare jv “llc units” at the equivalent of its offering price of 13 per share the proceeds from the concurrent offering of other securities were also used by change to acquire certain securities of change healthcare jv as a result mckesson’s equity interest in change healthcare jv was reduced to approximately 585  which was used to recognize our proportionate share in net loss from change healthcare jv commencing the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the ownership dilution to 585 from 70  we recognized a dilution loss of approximately 246 million in the second quarter of 2020 additionally our proportionate share of income or loss from this investment was subsequently reduced as immaterial settlements of stock option exercises occurred after the ipo and further diluted our ownership 

in the second quarter of 2020 we recorded an otti charge of 12 billion to our investment in change healthcare jv representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the fair value derived from the corresponding closing price of change’s common stock at september 30 2019 this charge was included within equity earnings and charges from investment in change healthcare joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march 31 2020  

on march 10 2020 we completed the previously announced separation of our interest in change healthcare jv the separation was effected through the splitoff of spinco a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that held all of our interest in change healthcare jv to certain of our stockholders through an exchange offer “splitoff” followed by the merger of spinco with and into change with change surviving the merger “merger” 

in connection with the exchange offer on march 9 2020 we distributed all 1760 million outstanding shares of common stock of spinco to participating holders of the company’s common stock in exchange for 154 million shares of mckesson common stock following consummation of the exchange offer on march 10 2020 the merger was consummated with each share of spinco common stock converted into one share of change common stock par value 0001 per share with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of change common stock the splitoff and merger are intended to be generally taxfree transactions to mckesson and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes following the splitoff we do not beneficially own any of change’s outstanding securities in connection with this transaction we recognized an estimated gain for financial reporting purposes of 414 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 which was largely driven by the reversal of a related deferred tax liability 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

after the separation change healthcare jv is required under the tra to pay mckesson 85 of the net cash tax savings realized or deemed to be realized resulting from depreciation or amortization allocated to change by mckesson the receipt of any payments under the tra is dependent upon change benefiting from this depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings which creates uncertainty over the amount timing and probability of the gain recognized as such we account for the tra as a gain contingency with no receivable recognized as of march 31 2020 

loss on debt extinguishment 

in 2018 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 122 million primarily representing premiums related to our february 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding longterm debt 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our derivative contracts interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in the issuance of commercial paper interest expense fluctuates based on timing amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees 

income tax expense benefit 

we recorded income tax expense of 18 million and 356 million and tax benefit of 53 million related to continuing operations for the years ended march 31 2020  2019 and 2018  our reported income tax expense rates were 16 and 584 in 2020 and 2019  and our income tax benefit rate was 222 in 2018  

our reported income tax expense rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by an estimated gain on the change healthcare jv divestiture of 414 million pretax and aftertax which was intended to generally be a taxfree splitoff for us federal income tax purposes and unfavorably impacted by charges of 275 million pretax and aftertax to remeasure the carrying value of assets and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new german wholesale joint venture within our european pharmaceutical solutions segment refer to financial note 2 “ investment in change healthcare joint venture ” and note 3 “ held for sale ” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for more information 

our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by charges of 18 billion pretax and aftertax to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our european pharmaceutical solutions segment given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes the reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was unfavorably impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of 17 billion pretax and aftertax given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes refer to financial note 14  “ goodwill and intangible assets net ” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act the 2018 income tax benefit rate included a tax benefit of 13 billion from the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower us federal tax rate partially offset by a tax expense of 457 million representing the onetime tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties although our major taxing jurisdictions include the us canada and the uk we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties 

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax was a loss of 6 million for the year ended march 31 2020 and income of 1 million and 5 million for the years ended march 31 2019 and 2018

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1  “ significant accounting policies ” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt 

sales to the company’s ten largest customers including gpos accounted for approximately 51 of total consolidated revenues in 2020 and comprised approximately 37 of total trade accounts receivable at march 31 2020  sales to our largest customer cvs health corporation “cvs” accounted for approximately 20 of our total consolidated revenues in 2020 and comprised approximately 20 of total trade accounts receivable march 31 2020  as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present with many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to covid19 we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2020 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed as well as assessment of trends currently available 

at march 31 2020  trade and notes receivables were 176 billion prior to allowances of 252 million  in 2020  2019 and 2018  our provision for bad debts was 91 million  132 million and 44 million  at march 31 2020 and 2019  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 14 and 18  an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2020 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 18 million  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worstcase scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k

inventories inventories consist of merchandise held for resale prior to 2018 we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” effective in the first quarter of 2018 we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value except for inventories determined using the lastin lastout “lifo” method which are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under lifo approximates market the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on firstin firstout “fifo” method and weighted average purchase prices rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold 

at march 31 2020 and 2019  total inventories net were 167 billion on our consolidated balance sheets the lifo method was used to value approximately 60 and 62 of our inventories at march 31 2020 and 2019  if we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation inventories would have been approximately 444 million and 696 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2020 and 2019  these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products we recognized lifo credits of 252 million  210 million and 99 million in 2020  2019 and 2018 in our consolidated statements of operations a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2020 and 2019  inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that the company obtains control of the acquired business any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a riskadjusted discount rate some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life refer to financial note 5  “ business acquisitions and divestitures ” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and longlived assets as a result of acquiring businesses we have 94 billion of goodwill at march 31 2020 and 2019  and 32 billion and 37 billion of intangible assets net at march 31 2020 and 2019  on october 1 2019 we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from january 1 to october 1 to better align with the timing of our annual longterm planning process this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge refer to note 14  “ goodwill and intangible assets net ” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

in 2018 we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test the onestep impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any up to the amount of goodwill the entity has recorded 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge under the market approach significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit under the income approach significant estimates and assumptions also includes the determination of discount rates the discount rates represent the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure included in the estimate of the weighted average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections an increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate 

based on the 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests the estimated fair values of our reporting units excluding the retail pharmacy formerly consumer solutions and pharmaceutical distribution formerly pharmacy solutions reporting units in our european pharmaceutical solutions segment exceeded their carrying values however other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods the estimated fair value of our mckesson canada reporting unit within other exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by 11 in 2020 the goodwill balance of this reporting unit was 14 billion at march 31 2020 or approximately 15 of the consolidated goodwill balance generally a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 12 or an increase in the discount rate in excess of 1 could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods refer to financial note 14  “ goodwill and intangible assets net ” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

currently all of our intangible and other longlived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 38 years we review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts

our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income refer to financial note 4  “ restructuring impairment and related charges ” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

equity method investments we evaluate our investments for otherthantemporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired when the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment we consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost the financial condition of the investees and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary expectations about the business operations of investees as well as industry financial and market factors any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge 

restructuring charges we have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exitrelated costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place we generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the ceaseuse dates other exitrelated costs are recognized as incurred in connection with these restructuring actions we also assess the recoverability of longlived assets used in the business and as a result we may recognize accelerated depreciation reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties and include those used to conclude on the taxfree nature of the separation of the change healthcare jv we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations 

we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided 

we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties in conjunction with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party while we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations consolidated financial position cash flows or liquidity refer to financial note 21  “ commitments and contingent liabilities ” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements as described within “trends and uncertainties” above the covid19 pandemic is developing rapidly we continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us we remain wellcapitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility additionally longterm debt markets and commercial paper markets our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations have remained open during the covid19 pandemic while there are signs of stress in both markets we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any nearterm liquidity needs we have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the federal reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets we believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements

operating activities 

net cash provided from operating activities was 44 billion  40 billion and 43 billion for the years ended march 31 2020  2019 and 2018  cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors additionally working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes inventory requirements and vendor payment terms operating activities for the year ended march 31 2020 were affected by increases in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with timing replenishing inventory stocks and effective working capital management and an increase in receivables primarily due to revenue growth operating activities for the year ended march 31 2019 were primarily affected by an increase in receivables due to the overall increase in sales volume and timing of receipts and increases in drafts and accounts payable primarily due to increased inventory purchases and timing of payments operating activities for the year ended march 31 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases 

during the year ended march 31 2020  we made a cash payment of 114 million from the executive benefit retirement plan other noncash items within operating activities for the year ended march 31 2020 primarily includes fair value remeasurement charges of 275 million related to our german wholesale business to be contributed to a joint venture a pension settlement charge of 122 million and stockbased compensation of 119 million

share repurchase plans 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions asr programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

in 2018 we repurchased 35 million of our shares through open market transactions and 67 million of our shares through asr programs we received an additional 10 million shares in the first quarter of 2019 under the march 2018 asr program in 2019 we repurchased 104 million of our shares through open market transactions and 21 million of our shares through the december 2018 asr program 

in 2019 we retired 50 million or 542 million of the company’s treasury shares previously repurchased under the applicable state law these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement in accordance with our accounting policy we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings accordingly our retained earnings and additional paidin capital were reduced by 472 million and 70 million during 2019

financial review continued 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing as described within “trends and uncertainties” above the covid19 pandemic is developing rapidly we continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 



 cash equivalents which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash are carried at fair value cash equivalents are primarily invested in aaarated us government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2020 and 2019 included approximately 17 billion and 15 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes following enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the repatriation of cash to the united states is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt and other current liabilities we require a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements the covid19 pandemic has potential to increase the variations in our working capital which we will continue to monitor closely 

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable and an increase in the current portion of longterm debt for term notes due in 2021 partially offset by an increase in receivables and cash and cash equivalents consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the cash and cash equivalents receivables inventories and a decrease in current portion of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable 

our debt to capital ratio increased for 2020 primarily due to decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by the splitoff of our interest in change healthcare jv and share repurchases our debt to capital ratio increased for 2019 primarily due to a decrease in stockholder’s equity driven by share repurchases 

in july 2019 we raised our quarterly dividend from 039 to 041 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the board dividends were 162 per share in 2020  151 per share in 2019 and 130 per share in 2018  we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2020  2019 and 2018  we paid total cash dividends of 294 million  292 million and  262 million  additionally as required under the domination agreement we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €083 per mckesson europe share effective january 1 2015 to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe

 the contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations 

at march 31 2020  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 784 million  the ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty 

our banks and insurance companies have issued 170 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at march 31 2020  these were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs 

the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to mckesson europe was 14 billion at march 31 2020  which exceeded the maximum redemption value of 12 billion  the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement on december 2 2014 the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe received a put right that enables them to put their mckesson europe shares to mckesson at €2299 per share which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the german bundesbank less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid “put amount” the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put amount are uncertain additionally we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €083 per mckesson europe share the “compensation amount” to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe under the domination agreement the compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period the domination agreement does not expire but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six month’s advance notice

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2020 and 2019  we had 40 billion and 30 billion and in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2020 and 2019 of approximately 60 million and 40 million  

foreign exchange risk we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps the forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2020 and 2019  the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 435 million and 581 million  however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 18  “ hedging activities ” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

competition

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

mckesson and its subsidiaries hold patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets related to mckesson products and services we pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship when such protection is advantageous through these efforts we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the us and worldwide in addition we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the us and in foreign countries 

we believe that in the aggregate mckesson’s confidential information patents copyrights trademarks and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent copyright trademark or trade secret or any family or families of the same we cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation theft or misuse of our technology nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers we periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights these claims may result in mckesson entering settlement agreements paying damages discontinuing use or sale of accused products or ceasing other activities while the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation 

we hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally and in some cases utilized in mckesson’s products or services while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party 

other information about the business 

customers   during 2019  sales to our ten  largest customers including gpos accounted for approximately 499  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 194  of our total consolidated revenues in may 2019 we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with cvs to june 2023 at march 31 2019  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 319  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 184  of total trade accounts receivable we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 6 of our purchases in 2019  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound the ten largest suppliers in 2019  accounted for approximately 42 of our purchases 

mckesson corporation 

some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development   research and development “rd” expenses were 71 million  125 million  and 341 million  during 2019  2018  and 2017  rd expenses were lower in 2019 due to the sale of our enterprise information solutions “eis” business rd costs were lower in 2018 due to the 2017 contribution of the majority of our mckesson technology solutions businesses “core mts business” to the change healthcare joint venture 

environmental regulation our operations are subject to regulations under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 24 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2019  and is not expected to be material in the next year

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies reduce costs and improve patient outcomes these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models increases in the use of managed care and consolidation in the healthcare industry we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income additionally if we experience disruptions in our supply of generic drugs our margins could be adversely affected due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations certain distribution business agreements with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation consequently our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases which we do not control in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation our generic pharmaceutical sourcing program has benefited from sourcing through our joint venture with walmart inc clarusone if clarusone does not continue to be successful our margins could be adversely affected our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends over the last three years continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the nature frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations additionally any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

mckesson corporation 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam  actions and could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements   our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates including government rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services imposing additional requirements on healthcare entities or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

for example on october 25 2018 the department of health  human services “hhs” announced its intent to propose an international pricing index “ipi” payment model to reduce government payments for medicare part b drugs to levels more closely aligned with prices paid in other countries if proposed and finalized the farreaching model could reduce part b drug reimbursement by 30 percent between 2020 and 2025 the model would eliminate the “buy and bill” model and reintroduce the competitive acquisition program “cap” this could allow private vendors including nonwholesaler entities to procure and distribute drugs to physicians and hospitals while medicare would pay the vendor for the included drugs based on the target price driven by the ipi also on january 31 2019 the hhs office of inspector general released the removal of safe harbor protection for rebates to plans or pharmacy benefit managers “pbm” involving prescription pharmaceuticals and creation of new safe harbor protection proposed rule if finalized the proposal would create significant change in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers pbm managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models additionally federal and state lawmakers are increasingly exploring other policy proposals to reduce drug price including price transparency measurers and drug reimportation 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments hhs the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding distribution and disposal of controlled substances 

as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities in some instances these can lead to monetary penalties andor license revocation in january 2017 we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid 150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances the dea suspended on a staggered basis for limited periods of time mckesson’s dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers as of march 31 2019 staggered suspensions have expired for two dea registrations and two remain applicable

although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in a prescription drug track and trace system track and trace began in 2015 at the lotlevel and evolves to a serialized level electronic interoperable system by november 2023 the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include track and trace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices 2d data matrix barcodes and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy   there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information in particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information known as “protected health information” and require the implementation of administrative physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a “business associate” through our relationships with customers we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a “covered entity” with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business 

the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes such as creating deidentified information other uses and disclosures such as marketing communications require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently deidentified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers further if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards we could face civil and criminal penalties hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means such as implementing a corrective action plan hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources in addition to enforcement by hhs state attorney generals are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents although we have implemented and maintained policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted enforced or applied to our operations in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level including the california consumer protection act which becomes effective in 2020 might also require us to make costly system purchases andor modifications from time to time

healthcare reform  the affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement andor finalize eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage further as a result of the november 2016 us presidential election and the november 2018 midterm election there are continued uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal certain provisions of the aca as well as moves to achieve universal healthcare coverage while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries moreover in europe mckesson europe ag “mckesson europe” formerly known as celesio ag operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region such as the reduction of reimbursement rates within the national health service in the united kingdom “uk” changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations for example the falsified medicines directive became operational in most european union “eu” countries on february 9 2019 and required implementing safety features for medicines including a unique identifier a twodimension barcode and an antitampering device on outer packaging political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

in june 2016 voters in the uk approved a referendum to withdraw the uks membership from the eu commonly referred to as brexit in march 2017 the uk government officially gave notice to leave starting a twoyear negotiation process the resulting withdrawal agreement was intended to ensure continuity as the uk could remain a de facto member until the end of 2020 during which time the two sides could negotiate their future political and trade relations however the uk legislature has declined to ratify the withdrawal agreement and no alternative agreement has been negotiated to govern the withdrawal of the uk from the eu the uk and the eu agreed to an extension of the deadline for withdrawal until october 31 2019 although the uk could leave the eu sooner than that date if the withdrawal agreement is ratified or if the parties reach an alternative agreement governing the withdrawal of the uk from the eu if no agreement is reached and the uk leaves the eu after the october 31 2019 deadline significant trade barriers would exist between the eu and the uk 

we have operations in the uk and the eu and as a result we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may lead up to and follow brexit including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the uk brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets for example depending on the terms of brexit the uk could also lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our solutions and services any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

mckesson corporation 

in addition foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for instance to reduce the cost for taxpayers provincial governments have taken and will continue to take steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include increased powers of investigation reporting and enforcement for provincial regulatory agencies the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers and the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada additional provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

general european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments including the government in the uk in the past year have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the foreign regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

personal data is highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate in addition some of the data that we process store and transmit may travel outside of the united states in europe we are subject to the general data protection regulation “gdpr” and in canada we are subject to the personal information protection and electronic documents act “pipeda” the gdpr and pipeda impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our results of operations which are stated in us dollars could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks additionally we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new domestic or international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of its realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial position and operating results events outside of our control including changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction 

mckesson corporation 

our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected 

on march 1 2017 mckesson contributed the majority of our core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses to form a joint venture change healthcare the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics network solutions and technologyenabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights exchange missioncritical information control costs optimize revenue opportunities increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to valuebased healthcare change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and timesensitive operational financial or strategic decisions and will require additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect including an initial public offering of change healthcare inc such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust class actions commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing tort and other various claims for example the company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies often together with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains named as defendants the company has been served with many complaints often brought by governmental entities including counties and municipalities that allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes in addition to common law claims including negligence and public nuisance and seek monetary damages and equitable relief some states and other governmental entities have indicated that they are considering filing similar suits all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

our businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by our businesses in all areas key competitive factors include price quality of service breadth of product lines innovation and in some cases convenience to the customer 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market accordingly we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues among our customers suppliers and competitors it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services it would also increase counterparty credit risk as the number of market participants decreases in addition when our customers combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our mckesson prescription technology solutions business experiences substantial competition from many companies including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered 

these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2019  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 499  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 194  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2019  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 319  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 184  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

mckesson corporation 

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the us false claims act the procurement integrity act the buy american act and the trade agreements act we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations although we our customers our strategic partners and our external service providers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems a failure or compromise of our our customers’ our strategic partners’ or our external service providers’ computer systems from a cyberattack natural disaster or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information and other types of personal information confidential financial information proprietary information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information protected health information financial information and confidential information relating to our business or third parties additionally we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide 

our industry is subject to various evolving federal state and international data and security laws and regulations which impose operational costs to achieve compliance any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement activity and the imposition of fines and other costs in addition compliance with these requirements could require changes in business practices complicate our operations and increase our oversight needs 

mckesson corporation 

the constant evolution of cyberattacks has caused us to spend more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks despite our implementation of a variety of physical technical and administrative security measures our our customers’ and our external service providers’ computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access such as physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering like other global companies we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems including malware and ransomware attacks unauthorized access system failures user errors and disruptions 

a failure or compromise of our our customers’ our strategic partners’ or our external service providers’ computer systems may result in business disruption or jeopardize the sensitive information processed stored and transmitted through such computer systems such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation financial losses litigation increased costs regulatory penalties notification costs remediation expenses customer attrition brand impairment or other business harm these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

transactions like our acquisitions of mckesson europe and rexall health expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we maintain liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our software and technology services may contain errors especially when first introduced for example some of our systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if clinicians’ use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyberattacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our contractors or thirdparty service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill intangible and other longlived assets or investments become further impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible and other longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other longlived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other longlived assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates a deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

mckesson corporation 

our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70 equity interest in change healthcare we may experience declines in its fair value a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment and such review could result in an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act which was comprehensive new tax legislation the 2017 tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowincome and generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries in addition we were subject to a onetime transition tax in 2018 on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax our accounting for the impact of the 2017 tax act was completed as of the period ended december 31 2018 the us treasury department and irs continue to issue regulations with respect to the 2017 tax act due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments are made refer to financial note 10 “income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations for example we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes “vat” the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission’s investigations into illegal state aid changes to longstanding tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

we are currently subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess tax liabilities against us developments in ongoing examinations could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments are made and for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of any ongoing tax controversy could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

mckesson corporation 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is underfunded 

we participate in various multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability in addition such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives 

from time to time the company may enter into restructuring and business process initiatives these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations moreover our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings 

we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar thirdparty relationships 

our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar thirdparty relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf if we fail to develop implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings or our thirdparty providers fail to perform as anticipated we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

moreover we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers certain of these resources may have access to personal information including protected health information some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information further congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with our retail expansion 

in recent years we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions as we expand our retail footprint we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter our expansion into additional retail markets such as those in europe and canada could result in increased competitive merchandising and distribution challenges we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers furthermore our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us or at all if our retail expansion fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable net sales and profitability levels our business results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected 

our retail stores may require additional management time and attention failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations local land use local zoning issues environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms in addition construction environmental zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

revenues 

revenues increased in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to market growth including expanded business with existing customers and our business acquisitions partially offset by loss of customers within our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment the increase in revenue for 2018 was also offset by the 2017 contribution of the majority of our mckesson technology solutions businesses “core mts business” to form the change healthcare joint venture market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion 

gross profit 

gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2019 compared to 2018 gross profit increased due to market growth partially offset by loss of customers the increase in gross profit and gross profit margin for 2019 was also due to the receipt of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements of 202 million higher lastin firstout “lifo” credits and our business acquisitions these increases in 2019 were partially offset by the incremental government reimbursement reductions in the united kingdom “uk” government imposed generic price cuts in canada and the 2018 third quarter sale of our enterprise information solutions “eis” business 

gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 the decrease was primarily due to the 2017 contribution of the core mts business to the change healthcare joint venture significant government reimbursement reductions in the uk the competitive sellside environment and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends these decreases in 2018 were partially offset by market growth procurement benefits realized through the joint sourcing entity clarusone sourcing services llp “clarusone” higher lifo credits and our business acquisitions 

gross profit for 2019 2018 and 2017 included lifo credits of 210 million  99 million and 7 million gross profit for 2017 benefited from 144 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements

goodwill impairments 

as a result of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test the estimated fair value of our reporting units excluding the cs and ps reporting units exceeded their carrying value however other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our mckesson canada reporting unit in other in future periods 

fiscal 2019 restructuring initiatives 

on april 25 2018 the company announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive longterm incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency the initiative consists of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize the company’s operating models and cost structures primarily through the centralization and outsourcing of certain administrative functions and cost management as part of the growth initiative we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce facility consolidation and store closures we expect to record total pretax charges of approximately 140 million  to 180 million  of which we recorded pretax charges of 135 million   122 million  aftertax in 2019 this set of the initiatives will be substantially completed by the end of 2020 estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exitrelated costs including contract termination costs 

as previously announced on november 30 2018 the company relocated its corporate headquarters from san francisco california to irving texas to improve efficiency collaboration and cost competitiveness effective april 1 2019 we anticipate that the relocation will be completed by january 2021 we expect to record total pretax charges of approximately 80 million  to 130 million  of which pretax charges of 33 million   24 million  aftertax were recorded in 2019 primarily representing employee severance estimated remaining charges primarily consist of lease and other exitrelated costs employee retention and relocation expenses 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to additional programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts we continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through the expanded arrangement with a thirdparty vendor to achieve operational efficiency the programs also include reorganization and consolidation of our business operations and related headcount reductions as well as the further closures of retail pharmacy stores in europe and facilities we expect to incur total pretax charges of approximately 300 million  to 350 million  for these programs which are expected to be completed by the end of 2021 in 2019 pretax charges of 163 million   127 million  aftertax were recorded which primarily represent employee severance and accelerated depreciation expense estimated remaining charges primarily consist of facility and other exit costs and employeerelated costs

other income net other income net for 2019 and 2018 increased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to higher gains recognized from the sales of investments

acquisitionrelated expenses and adjustments were recorded as follows 



 amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets 

amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets directly related to business acquisitions and the formation of the change healthcare joint venture were 790 million  792 million  and 440 million  in 2019 2018 and 2017 these expenses were primarily recorded in our operating expenses and for 2019 and 2018 also in our proportionate share of loss from the equity method investment in change healthcare 

income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 356 million  benefit of 53 million  and expense of 1614 million  related to continuing operations in 2019 2018 and 2017 our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was 584  compared to an income tax benefit rate of 222  for 2018 and an income tax expense rate of 234  in 2017 fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to the impact of the 2017 tax act the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the us rate 

our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by noncash pretax charges of 1776 million   1756 million  aftertax to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our european pharmaceutical solutions segment given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act the 2018 income tax benefit rate included a tax benefit of 1324 million from the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower us federal tax rate partially offset by a tax expense of 457 million representing the onetime tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries the reported income tax benefit and expense rates for 2018 and 2017 were also unfavorably affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charges of 1738 million  pretax and aftertax and 290 million   282 million  aftertax given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes refer to financial note 2 “goodwill impairment charges” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties although our major taxing jurisdictions include the us canada and the uk we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties 

on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit court of appeals issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to sharebased compensation this opinion reversed the prior decision of the united states tax court on august 7 2018 the opinion was withdrawn and a rehearing of the case took place on october 16 2018 we will continue to monitor developments in this case and the ultimate outcome may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate

our foreign operations represented approximately 18 18 and 17 of our consolidated revenues in 2019  2018  and 2017  foreign operations are subject to certain risks including currency fluctuations we monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate we conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar as a result the comparability of our results reported in us dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in discussing our operating results we may use the term “foreign currency effect” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar we present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations in computing foreign currency effect we translate our current year results in local currencies into us dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in us dollars additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in financial note 28 “segments of business” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2019  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 499  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 194  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2019  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 319  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 184  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2019  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future 

at march 31 2019  trade and notes receivables were 15329 million prior to allowances of 273 million in 2019  2018  and 2017  our provision for bad debts was 132 million  44 million  and 93 million  at march 31 2019  and 2018  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 18 and 13 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2019  allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 15 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worstcase scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   inventories consist of merchandise held for resale prior to 2018 we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” effective in the first quarter of 2018 we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value except for inventories determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on firstin firstout method and weighted average purchase prices rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories net were 16709 million  and 16310 million  at march 31 2019  and 2018  

the lifo method was used to value approximately 62  and 63  of our inventories at march 31 2019  and 2018  if we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation inventories would have been approximately 696 million  and 906 million  higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2019  and 2018  these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products we recognized lifo credits of 210 million  99 million  and 7 million  in 2019 2018 and 2017 within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory

we believe that moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2019 and 2018 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether inventory valuation allowance is required we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use a method based on the income approach methods under the income approach start with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in methods based on the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives refer to financial note 4 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and longlived assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 9358 million  and 10924 million  of goodwill at march 31 2019  and 2018  3689 million  and 4102 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2019  and 2018  we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

in 2018 we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test the onestep impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge for example some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the dcf method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business under the income approach the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units the discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital the unsystematic risk premium is an input factor used in calculating discount rate that specifically addresses uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections increases in the unsystematic risk premium increase the discount rate 

as a result of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test the estimated fair value of our reporting units excluding the cs and ps reporting units exceeded their carrying value however other risks expenses and future developments such as additional government actions increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods for example the estimated fair value of our mckesson canada reporting unit within other exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by 8 in 2019 the goodwill balance of this reporting unit was 1444 million at march 31 2019 or approximately 15 of the consolidated goodwill balance generally a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 12 or an increase in the discount rate in excess of 10 could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods refer to financial note 2 “goodwill impairment charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

currently all of our intangible and other longlived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 38 years we review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 

our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income refer to financial note 3 “restructuring and asset impairment charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

restructuring charges we have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exitrelated costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place we generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the ceaseuse dates other exitrelated costs are recognized as incurred in connection with these restructuring actions we also assess the recoverability of longlived assets used in the business and as a result we may recognize accelerated depreciation reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in facts and circumstances the final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate the supplier reserves primarily pertain to our us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations for example on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive new tax legislation referred to as the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code refer to financial note 10 “income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions

in 2017 we repurchased 141 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 14 million  of our shares through an asr program we received 03 million  additional shares in april 2017 for the 2017 asr program in 2018 we repurchased 35 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 67 million of our shares through asr programs we received an additional 10 million  shares in the first quarter of 2019 under the march 2018 asr program in 2019 we repurchased 104 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 21 million  of our shares through the december 2018 asr program 

in 2019 we retired 50 million or 542 million of the company’s treasury shares previously repurchased under the applicable state law these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement in accordance with our accounting policy we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings accordingly our retained earnings and additional paidin capital were reduced by 472 million  and 70 million during 2019 



 

the total authorization outstanding for repurchase of the company’s common stock was 35 billion  at march 31 2019 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2019 included approximately 1450 million of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes following enactment of the 2017 tax act the repatriation of cash to the united states is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes

financial review concluded 

 interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2019 and 2018 we had 30 billion  and 27 billion  and in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2019 and 2018 of approximately 4 million and 10 million 

foreign exchange risk   we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps the forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2019 and 2018 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 581 million and 458 million however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 20 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies reduce costs and improve patient outcomes these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models increases in the use of managed care and consolidation in the healthcare industry we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income additionally if we experience disruptions in our supply of generic drugs our margins could be adversely affected due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation consequently our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases which we do not control in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation our generic pharmaceutical sourcing program has benefited from the joint sourcing entity clarusone if clarusone does not continue to be successful our margins could be adversely affected our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends over the last three years continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the nature frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations additionally any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised subject to rulemaking the federal upper limits “ful” for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis on february 1 2016 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” published the covered outpatient drugs final rule the final rule with limited exceptions establishes the ful to be 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization across a drug molecule when multiple sources are available of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” additionally the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist’s professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component use of the revised ampbased ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for example under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price “asp” plus 6 the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation on september 20 2017 cms issued a request for information seeking recommendations for payment models which could include prescription drug models under medicare parts b and d and state medicaid programs cms noted its interest in drug pricing and valuebased purchasing models involving “novel arrangements between plans manufacturers and stakeholders across the supply chain” additionally cms published a proposed rule on july 20 2017 that would cut medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug pricing program at asp minus 225 with certain exceptions rather than asp plus 6 cms finalized this rule on november 1 2017 as another example the medicare access and chip reauthorization act “macra” signed into law in april 2015 seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers most notably macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula instead after a period of stable payment updates macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions including extending the children’s health insurance program additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding distribution and disposal of controlled substances 

as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities in some instances these can lead to monetary penalties andor license revocation in january 2017 we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid the sum of 150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances the dea is suspending on a staggered basis for limited periods of time mckesson’s dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers 

mckesson corporation 

although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable lotlevel prescription drug track and trace system the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices 2d data matrix barcodes and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy   there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information in particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information known as “protected health information” and require the implementation of administrative physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a “business associate” through our relationships with customers we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a “covered entity” with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business 

the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes such as creating deidentified information other uses and disclosures such as marketing communications require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently deidentified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers further if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards we could face civil and criminal penalties hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means such as implementing a corrective action plan hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources in addition to enforcement by hhs state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents although we have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted enforced or applied to our operations in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level might also require us to make costly system purchases andor modifications from time to time

healthcare reform  the affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement andor finalize eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage further as a result of the november 2016 us presidential election there are continued uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal certain provisions of the aca or other healthcare reforms and we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time a top legislative priority of the new presidential administration and congress may be significant reform of the aca as discussed above while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example in february 2015 the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems medical image storage devices and medical image communication devices if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products once issued may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products in december 2016 congress passed and the president signed into law the 21st century cures act the 21st century cures act changes the way health it would be regulated by the fda the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda’s jurisdiction but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a casebycase basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety 

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries moreover in europe mckesson europe ag “mckesson europe” formerly known as celesio ag operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad 

on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which proposed exit and the political economic and other uncertainties it has raised has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above negotiations on withdrawal and postexit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the proposed withdrawal could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

in addition foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for instance to reduce the cost for taxpayers provincial governments have taken and will continue to take steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include increased powers of investigation reporting and enforcement for provincial regulatory agencies the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers and the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada additional provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

general european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments including the government in the united kingdom in the past year have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in europe beginning may 25 2018 we are subject to the general data protection regulation which requires eu member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security in addition certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our results of operations which are stated in us dollars could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the us dollar we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks additionally we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new domestic or international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of its realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial position and operating results events outside of our control including changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction 

mckesson corporation 

our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected 

on march 1 2017 mckesson contributed the majority of its core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses to form a joint venture change healthcare the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics network solutions and technologyenabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights exchange missioncritical information control costs optimize revenue opportunities increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to valuebased healthcare change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and timesensitive operational financial or strategic decisions and will require additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect including an initial public offering of change healthcare such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust class actions commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing tort and other various claims for example the company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies often together with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains named as defendants the company has been served with many complaints often brought by governmental entities including counties and municipalities that allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes in addition to common law claims including negligence and public nuisance and seek monetary damages and equitable relief some states and other governmental entities have indicated that they are considering filing similar suits all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

our distribution solutions segment and commencing in first quarter of 2019 our reportable segments including us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions european pharmaceutical solutions medicalsurgical solutions and other faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment in all areas key competitive factors include price quality of service breadth of product lines innovation and in some cases convenience to the customer 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market accordingly we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues among our customers suppliers and competitors it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services it would also increase counterparty credit risk as the number of market participants decreases in addition when our customers combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our mckesson prescription technology solutions business experiences substantial competition from many companies including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered 

these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2018  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 517  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 199  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2018  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 249  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 164  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the us false claims act the procurement integrity act the buy american act and the trade agreements act we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations although we our customers and our external service providers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems a failure or compromise of our our customers’ or our external service providers’ computer systems from a cyberattack natural disaster or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information protected health information financial information and confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data that we process store and transmit may travel outside of the united states additionally we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide 

our industry is subject to various evolving federal state and international data and security laws and regulations which impose operational costs to achieve compliance any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement activity and fines in addition compliance with these requirements could require changes in business practices complicate our operations and increase our oversight needs 

mckesson corporation 

the constant evolution of cyberattacks has caused us to spend more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks despite our implementation of a variety of physical technical and administrative security measures our our customers’ and our external service providers’ computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access such as physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering like other global companies we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems including malware and ransomware attacks unauthorized access system failures and disruptions 

a failure or compromise of our our customers’ or our external service providers’ computer systems may result in business disruption or jeopardize the confidential proprietary and sensitive information processed stored and transmitted through such computer systems such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation financial losses litigation increased costs regulatory penalties notification costs remediation expenses customer attrition brand impairment or other business harm these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

transactions like our acquisitions of mckesson europe and rexall health expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we maintain liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our software and technology services may contain errors especially when first introduced for example some of our systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if clinicians’ use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyberattacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our contractors or thirdparty service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill intangible and other longlived assets or investments become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible and other longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other longlived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other longlived assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates a deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

mckesson corporation 

our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70 equity interest in change healthcare upon closing we may experience declines in its fair value a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment and such review could result in an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective in 2018 the 2017 tax act reduces the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective in 2019 it creates new taxes focused on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments in addition we were subject to a onetime transition tax in 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 on december 22 2017 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march 31 2018 in accordance with sab 118 the us treasury department and irs have not yet issued regulations with respect to the 2017 tax act due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments are made refer to financial note 10 “income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations for example we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes “vat” the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission’s investigations into illegal state aid changes to longstanding tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

mckesson corporation 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as the amended guidance for leases may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is underfunded 

we participate in various multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability in addition such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives 

from time to time the company may enter into restructuring and business process initiatives in april 2018 the company announced a multiyear strategic growth initiative focused on creating innovative new solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth the initiative includes a comprehensive review of the company’s operations and cost structure designed to increase efficiency accelerate execution and improve longterm performance in march 2016 the company also committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs “cost alignment plan” the cost alignment plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019 these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations moreover our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings 

we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar thirdparty relationships 

our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar thirdparty relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf if we fail to develop implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings or our thirdparty providers fail to perform as anticipated we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect the results of our operations 

mckesson corporation 

moreover we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers certain of these resources may have access to personal information including protected health information some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information further congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with our retail expansion 

in recent years we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions as we expand our retail footprint we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter our expansion into additional retail markets such as those in europe and canada could result in increased competitive merchandising and distribution challenges we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers furthermore our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us or at all if our retail expansion fails to achieve or unable to sustain acceptable net sales and profitability levels our business results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected 

our retail stores may require additional management time and attention failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations local land use local zoning issues environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms in addition construction environmental zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

overview 



bp  basis points 

nm  not meaningful 

revenues for 2018  and 2017 increased 5  and 4  compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to market growth reflecting growing drug utilization and price increases our business acquisitions and expanded business with existing customers within our north america pharmaceutical distribution businesses these increases for 2018 and 2017 were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers and for 2018 also by the contribution of the majority of our mckesson technology solutions businesses “core mts business” to a joint venture in march 2017 as further discussed below 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago the decrease for 2018 was primarily due to the contribution of the core mts business significant government reimbursement reductions in the united kingdom “uk” the competitive sellside environment and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends these decreases in 2018 were partially offset by market growth procurement benefits realized through the joint sourcing entity clarusone sourcing services llp “clarusone” higher lastin firstout “lifo” credits and our business acquisitions 

gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2017  primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends the competitive sellside pricing environment our mix of business and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our us pharmaceutical distribution business these decreases for 2017 were partially offset by our business acquisitions lifo inventory credits higher cash receipts from antitrust legal settlements and higher procurement benefits gross profit for 2017 and 2016 benefited from 144 million  and 76 million  of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements lifo credits were 99 million  and 7 million  in 2018 and 2017 and lifo charges were 244 million  in 2016  lifo credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines partially offset by the lower inventory level lifo expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases 

 our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years 

on march 1 2017 we contributed our core mts business to the newly formed joint venture change healthcare llc “change healthcare” under the terms of a contribution agreement entered into between mckesson and change healthcare holdings inc “change” and others including shareholders of change we retained our relayhealth pharmacy “rhp” and enterprise information solutions “eis” businesses the rhp business was transferred to our mds segment effective april 1 2017 and the eis business was sold to a third party in the third quarter of 2018 we accounted for this transaction as a sale of the core mts business and a subsequent purchase of a 70 interest in the newly formed joint venture refer to financial note 2 “healthcare technology net asset exchange” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

total operating expenses increased in 2018  and decreased in 2017  compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to a pretax gain of 3947 million  aftertax gain of 3018 million  recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the core mts business 

2018 total operating expenses also increased due to 

 these increases in 2018 total operating expenses were partially offset by a pretax gain of 109 million  aftertax gain of 30 million  from the 2018 third quarter sale of our eis business in our technology solutions segment 

excluding the gain on healthcare technology net asset exchange 2017 total operating expenses increased primarily due to a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of 290 million   282 million  aftertax related to our eis business within our technology solutions segment and higher expenses due to our business acquisitions 2017 total operating expenses benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ongoing expense management efforts 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

our investment in change healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting during 2018 we recorded our proportionate share of loss from change healthcare of 248 million  under the caption “loss from equity method investment in change healthcare” in our consolidated statements of operations we recorded our proportionate share of a provisional net benefit recognized by change healthcare from the enactment of the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” of 76 million  primarily due to a reduction in future applicable tax rate 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a pretax loss of 122 million  78 million aftertax on debt extinguishment related to our february 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding longterm debt refer to financial note 16 “debt and financing activities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to the pretax gain recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the core mts business income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018  also due to the goodwill impairment charges within our distribution solutions segment the restructuring and asset impairment charges our proportionate share of loss from our equity method investment in change healthcare and loss on debt extinguishment 

our reported income tax benefit rate was 222  in 2018  and income tax expense rates were 234  and 279  in 2017  and 2016  fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to change in tax laws including the recently enacted 2017 tax act the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the us rate 

during 2018 as a result of the 2017 tax act we have recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1324 million  due to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower us federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of 457 million  for the onetime tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits “ep” of our foreign subsidiaries refer to financial note 10 “income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax for 2017 includes an aftertax loss from discontinued operations of 113 million  resulting from the 2017 first quarter sale of our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

during the second quarter of 2018 our mckesson europe reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily in our united kingdom “uk” retail business driven by significant government reimbursement reductions affecting retail pharmacy economics across the uk market as a result we performed the interim impairment test in the second quarter of 2018 and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 350 million  pretax and aftertax during the fourth quarter of 2018 this reporting unit had a further decline in its estimated future cash flows driven by weakening script growth projections in our uk business and by a more competitive environment in france based on the annual goodwill impairment test we recorded noncash charges of 933 million  pretax and aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2018 to impair this reporting unit’s goodwill balance the discount rates and terminal growth rates were 75  and 125  for the 2018 second quarter interim test and 80  and 125  for the 2018 annual test compared to 70  and 15  in our 2017 annual impairment test at march 31 2018 this reporting unit had a remaining goodwill balance of 1851 million  

rexall health as a result of the 2018 annual impairment test we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment charge pretax and aftertax of 455 million  in 2018 during the fourth quarter of 2018 this reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces which can only be partially mitigated through the business’ cost saving efforts the discount rate and terminal growth rate used in the annual impairment testing were 100  and 20  at march 31 2018 the rexall health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of rexall health 

other risks expenses and future developments that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing dates in 2018 may require us to further revise the estimated future cash flows which could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units in future periods as a result we may be required to record additional impairment charges refer to financial note 3 “goodwill impairment charges” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

restructuring and asset impairments 

mckesson europe due to the previously described decline in future estimated cash flows related to our uk retail business we also recorded total noncash pretax charges of 189 million   157 million  aftertax to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets primarily pharmacy licenses and store assets during the second quarter of 2018 additionally during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to further declines in estimated future cash flows in our european business we also recorded a noncash pretax charge of 257 million   253 million  aftertax to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets primarily customer relationships and capitalized software assets 

on september 29 2017 we committed to a restructuring plan which primarily consists of the closures or sales of underperforming retail stores in the uk and a reduction in workforce the plan is expected to be substantially implemented prior to the first half of 2019 as part of this plan we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 74 million   67 million  aftertax in operating expenses during 2018 primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs

revenues increased 5  and 4  in 2018  and 2017  compared to the same periods a year ago primarily driven by our distribution solutions segment 

distribution solutions 

north america pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth reflecting growing drug utilization price increases higher revenues associated with our acquisitions and expanded business with existing customers these increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers

gross profit and gross profit margin for 2018 increased compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to market growth procurement benefits realized through clarusone higher lifo inventory credits our business acquisitions and the transfer of our rhp business from our technology solutions segment these increases were partially offset by significant government reimbursement reductions in the uk the competitive sellside pricing environment weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and our mix of business gross profit and gross profit margin for 2017 decreased primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends the competitive sellside pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer in our us pharmaceutical distribution business partially offset by lifo inventory credits higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements higher procurement benefits and our business acquisitions gross profit also reflects the impact of recent customer consolidation activities 

our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years 

our lifo inventory credits were 99 million  and 7 million  in 2018 and 2017 and lifo charges were 244 million  in 2016 our north america distribution business uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory our annual lifo charge or credit is affected by changes in yearend inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be influenced by market and other external factors changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual lifo credit or expense lifo credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines partially offset by lower inventory level lifo expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases as of march 31 2018 and 2017 pharmaceutical inventories at lifo did not exceed current replacement cost

our reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the 2017 tax act enacted on december 22 2017 as a result of the 2017 tax act we recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1324 million  due to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower us federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of 457 million  for the onetime tax imposed on certain accumulated ep of our foreign subsidiaries

on march 1 2017 we contributed assets to change healthcare as further described in financial note 2 “healthcare technology net asset exchange” while this transaction was predominantly structured as a tax free asset contribution for us federal income tax purposes under section 721a of the internal revenue code we recorded tax expense of 929 million on the gain the tax expense was primarily driven by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the excess book over tax basis in our equity investment in change healthcare

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2018  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 517  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 199  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2018  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 249  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 164  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2018  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future 

at march 31 2018  trade and notes receivables were 14480 million prior to allowances of 187 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  our provision for bad debts was 44 million  93 million  and 113 million  at march 31 2018  and 2017  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 13 and 17 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2018  allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 14 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worstcase scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   prior to 2018 we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” effective in the first quarter of 2018 we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value except for inventories determined using the lifo method inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the firstin firstout method “fifo” rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories net were 16310 million  and 15278 million  at march 31 2018  and 2017

the lifo method was used to value approximately 63  and 70  of our inventories at march 31 2018  and 2017  if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation inventories would have been approximately 906 million  and 1005 million  higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2018  and 2017  these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products we recognized net lifo credits of 99 million  and 7 million  in 2018 and 2017 and net lifo charges of 244  million in 2016 within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2018 and 2017 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether inventory valuation allowance is required we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives refer to financial note 6 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and longlived assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 10924 million  and 10586 million  of goodwill at march 31 2018  and 2017  4102 million  and 3665 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2018  and 2017  we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

in 2018 we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test the onestep impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge for example some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the dcf method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business under the income approach the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units the discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital the unsystematic risk premium is an input factor used in calculating discount rate that specifically addresses uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections increases in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate 

in 2016 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in 2017 we recorded a noncash charge to impair the carrying value of our eis reporting unit’s goodwill in 2018 we recorded noncash charges to impair the carrying value of goodwill balance for our mckesson europe and rexall health reporting units refer to financial note 3 “goodwill impairment charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

commencing in the first quarter of 2019 our operating structure will be realigned into three reportable segments us pharmaceutical and specialty solutions european pharmaceutical solutions and medicalsurgical solutions all remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to be reportable segments are combined into other 

this change in our operating segment structure will result in two new reporting units within the european pharmaceutical solutions segment as a result we will be required to perform a goodwill impairment test for the impacted new reporting units immediately before and after the segment change while we believe the assumptions used in our 2018 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results for our 2018 reporting unit structure we may recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge immediately after the segment change as the reassigned carrying values of the reporting units may exceed their respective estimated fair values we are currently evaluating the impact and are unable to reasonably estimate the additional goodwill impairment charge upon the segment change at march 31 2018 the total remaining goodwill balance for these two reporting units was 1851 million  

a further decrease in the estimated future cash flows an increase in the discount rate andor a decrease in the terminal growth rate could also result in an additional goodwill impairment charge for these reporting units 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

currently all of our intangible and other longlived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 38 years we review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts during 2018 we performed an impairment test of intangible and other longlived assets and recognized noncash asset impairment charges of 479 million pretax 443 million aftertax for mckesson europe and rexall health businesses to impair the carrying value of certain intangible and other longlived assets we utilized an income approach dcf method or a combination of an income approach and a market approach for estimating the fair value of intangible assets the fair value of the intangible assets is considered a level 3 fair value measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information there were no material impairments of intangibles and other longlived assets in 2017 or 2016 within our continuing operations our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income refer to financial note 4 “restructuring and asset impairment charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2018  and 2017  supplier reserves were 227 million and 201 million the final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2018  and 2017  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2018  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 32 million in 2018  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations for example on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive new tax legislation referred to as the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code although our accounting for the impact of the 2017 tax act is incomplete we have made estimates based on management judgment and recorded provisional amounts refer to financial note 10 “income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuance will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition we may access the longterm debt capital markets from time to time 

net cash flow provided from operating activities was 4345 million in 2018  compared to 4744 million  in 2017  and  3672 million  in 2016  operating activities for 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases operating activities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors additionally working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes inventory requirements and vendor payment terms operating activities for 2017 and 2016 included cash generated from our core mts business operating activities for 2017 were also affected by 150 million of settlement payment 

net cash used in investing activities was 1522 million  in 2018  compared to 3796 million  in 2017  and 1557 million  in 2016  investing activities for 2018 include 2893 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions including 13 billion  and 724 million  for our acquisitions of covermymeds llc and rxcrossroads 405 million  and 175 million  in capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and capitalized software 374 million  of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and other assets and 126 million  cash payment received related to the healthcare technology net asset exchange 

investing activities for 2017 included 4237 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions including 21 billion  for our acquisition of rexall health 1228 million  of net payments received on healthcare technology net asset exchange 404 million  and 158 million  in capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and capitalized software and 206 million  of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and equity investments investing activities for 2016 included 40 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions 488 million  and 189 million  in capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and capitalized software and 210 million  of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment

financing activities for 2017 include cash receipts of 8294 million  and payments of 8124 million  from shortterm borrowings we received cash from longterm debt issuances of 1824 million  and made repayments on longterm debt of 1601 million  in 2017 financing activities in 2017 also include 2250 million  of cash paid for stock repurchases and 253 million  of dividends paid 

financing activities for 2016 include cash receipts of 1561 million and payments of 1688 million from shortterm borrowings we made repayments on longterm debt of 1598 million in 2016 financing activities in 2016 also include 1504 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and 244 million of dividends paid 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of the company’s common stock up to 4 billion in october 2016 in 2016 we repurchased 87 million of our shares through a combination of an asr program and open market transactions in 2017 we repurchased 141 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 14 million  of our shares through an asr program we received 03 million  additional shares in april 2017 for the 2017 asr program in 2018 we repurchased 35 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 67 million of our shares through asr programs we received an additional 05 million  shares in april 2018 under the march 2018 asr program 



 

at march 31 2018 the total authorization outstanding was 11 billion  available under the october 2016 share repurchase plan for future repurchases of the company’s common stock in may 2018 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 40 billion  of the company’s common stock the total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the company’s common stock was increased to 51 billion  

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

 the contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations 

at march 31 2018 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 970 million the ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty 

at march 31 2018 we had a 90 million  noncurrent liability payable to change healthcare shareholders associated with a tax receivable agreement entered into in connection with healthcare technology net asset exchange the amount is based on certain estimates and could become payable in periods after a disposition of our investment in change healthcare 

our banks and insurance companies have issued 259  million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at march 31 2018 these were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs 

the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to mckesson europe was 146 billion  at march 31 2018 which exceeded the maximum redemption value of 135 billion  the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement on december 2 2014 the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe received a put right that enables them to put their mckesson europe shares to mckesson at €2299 per share which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the german bundesbank less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid “put amount” the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put amount are uncertain

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2018 and 2017 we had 27 billion  and 28 billion  and in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2018 and 2017 of approximately 10 million and 19 million 

foreign exchange risk   we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps the forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2018 and 2017 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 458 million and 357 million however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 20 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps

our technology solutions segment and our technology businesses within our distribution solutions segment experience substantial competition from many companies including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered

other information about the business

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2017  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good the ten largest suppliers in 2017  accounted for approximately 40 of our purchases 

mckesson corporation 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies reduce costs and improve patient outcomes these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models increases in the use of managed care consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation consequently our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases which we do not control in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation during 2017 our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends which are expected to continue in 2018 continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the nature frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations additionally any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections 

mckesson corporation 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised subject to rulemaking the federal upper limits “ful” for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis on january 21 2016 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released the covered outpatient drugs final rule with comment the final rule with limited exceptions establishes the ful to be 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” additionally the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist’s professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component use of the revised ampbased ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

mckesson corporation 

the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for example under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price “asp” plus 6 the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation as another example the medicare access and chip reauthorization act “macra” signed into law in april 2015 seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers most notably macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula instead after a period of stable payment updates macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions including extending the children’s health insurance program additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding distribution and disposal of controlled substances 

as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities in some instances these can lead to monetary penalties andor license revocation in january 2017 we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid the sum of 150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances the dea is suspending on a staggered basis for limited periods of time mckesson’s dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers 

although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable lotlevel prescription drug track and trace system the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

mckesson corporation 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy   there are numerous federal state and foreign laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information in particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information known as “protected health information” and require the implementation of administrative physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a “business associate” through our relationships with customers we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a “covered entity” with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business 

the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes such as creating deidentified information other uses and disclosures such as marketing communications require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently deidentified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers further if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards we could face civil and criminal penalties hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means such as implementing a corrective action plan hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources in addition to enforcement by hhs state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents although we have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted enforced or applied to our operations in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level might also require us to make costly system purchases andor modifications from time to time 

healthcare reform  the affordable care act “aca” significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement andor finalize eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage further as a result of the november 2016 us presidential election there are uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal the aca or other healthcare reforms and we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time two top legislative priorities of the new presidential administration and congress may be significant reform of the aca as discussed above and reform of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example in february 2015 the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems medical image storage devices and medical image communication devices if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products once issued may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products in december 2016 congress passed and the president signed into law the 21st century cures act the 21st century cures act changes the way health it would be regulated by the fda the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda’s jurisdiction but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a casebycase basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety 

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries moreover in europe celesio operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad 

on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which proposed exit and the political economic and other uncertainties it has raised has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above negotiations on withdrawal and postexit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the proposed withdrawal could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

in addition foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for instance to reduce the cost for taxpayers provincial governments have taken steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies as well as the tendering of drug distribution services by provincial governments these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

general european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the company’s acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and accordingly our exposure to economic conditions in europe a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments including the government in the united kingdom in the past year have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in europe we are subject to the 1995 european union “eu” directive on data protection “1995 data protection directive” which requires eu member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security in addition certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards in may 2018 the general data protection regulation “gdpr” will supersede current eu data protection legislation impose more stringent eu data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our results of operations which are stated in us dollars could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the us dollar for example the day after the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union in june 2016 the british pound sterling fell by more than 10 percent against the us dollar to its lowest level in more than 30 years the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and euro and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling and euro could have significant impacts on the business and financial results we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks additionally we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new domestic or international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of its realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial position and operating results events outside of our control including changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction 

our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected 

on march 1 2017 mckesson contributed the majority of its core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses to form a joint venture change healthcare the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics network solutions and technologyenabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights exchange missioncritical information control costs optimize revenue opportunities increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to valuebased healthcare change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and timesensitive operational financial or strategic decisions and will require additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect including an initial private offering of change healthcare such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust class actions commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

our distribution solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment in all areas key competitive factors include price quality of service breadth of product lines innovation and in some cases convenience to the customer 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market accordingly we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues among our customers suppliers and competitors it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services it would also increase counterparty credit risk as the number of market participants decreases in addition when our customers combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our technology solutions segment and mckesson rx technology solutions businesses experience substantial competition from many companies including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered 

these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2017  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 542  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 202  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2017  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 337  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 178  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the us false claims act the procurement integrity act the buy american act and the trade agreements act we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations although we and our customers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems a failure or compromise of our or our customers’ computer systems from a cyberattack natural disaster or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information protected health information financial information and confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data that we process store and transmit may travel outside of the united states additionally we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide 

despite our implementation of a variety of physical technical and administrative security measures our and our customers’ computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access such as physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering like other global companies we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems including malware and ransomware attacks unauthorized access system failures and disruptions 

mckesson corporation 

a failure or compromise of our or our customers’ computer systems may jeopardize the confidential proprietary and sensitive information processed stored and transmitted through such computer systems such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation financial losses litigation increased costs regulatory penalties customer attrition brand impairment or other business harm these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

transactions like our acquisitions of celesio and rexall expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we maintain liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our software and technology services may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if clinicians’ use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyberattacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our contractors or third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill intangible assets or investments become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70 equity interest in change healthcare upon closing we may experience declines in its fair value a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment and such review could result in impairments and charges to our consolidated statements of operations 

mckesson corporation 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow additionally if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues it may adversely impact our tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations for example we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes “vat” the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission’s investigations into illegal state aid changes to longstanding tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as the amended guidance for revenue recognition and leases may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities 

we participate in various multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability in addition such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives 

on march 14 2016 the company committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs “cost alignment plan” the cost alignment plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019 expense reduction initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations moreover our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings 

we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third party relationships 

our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar thirdparty relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf if we fail to develop implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect the results of our operations 

moreover we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers certain of these resources may have access to personal information including protected health information some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information further congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may face risks associated with our retail expansion 

in recent years we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions as we expand our retail footprint we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter our expansion into additional retail markets such as those in europe and canada could result in increased competitive merchandising and distribution challenges we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers furthermore our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us or at all if our retail expansion fails to achieve or unable to sustain acceptable net sales and profitability levels our business results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected 

mckesson corporation 

our retail stores may require additional management time and attention failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations local land use local zoning issues environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms in addition construction environmental zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

overview 



revenues for 2017  and 2016 increased 4  and 7  compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to market growth and expanded business with existing customers within our north america pharmaceutical distribution businesses revenues for 2017 also increased due to our 2017 acquisitions including udg healthcare plc “udg” biologics inc “biologics” vantage oncology holdings llc “vantage” and rexall health market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion

operating expenses decreased 47  and 7 in 2017  and 2016  compared to the same periods a year ago excluding favorable foreign currency effects of 2 and 5 operating expenses decreased 45 and 2 in 2017 and 2016 operating expenses decreased in 2017 primarily due to a pretax gain of 3947 million  aftertax gain of 3018 million  recognized from the deconsolidation of the majority of our technology solutions businesses “core mts business” as further described below 

on june 28 2016 we entered into a contribution agreement with change and others including shareholders of change to form a joint venture change healthcare on march 1 2017 the transaction closed upon satisfaction of all closing conditions pursuant to the contribution agreement under the terms of the contribution agreement we contributed the majority of our core mts business to the joint venture we retained our relayhealth pharmacy and eis businesses we accounted for this transaction as a sale of the core mts business and a subsequent purchase of a 70  interest in the newly formed joint venture accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2017 we deconsolidated the core mts business and recorded a pretax gain of 3947 million  aftertax gain of 3018 million  the pretax gain was calculated based on the difference between the fair value of our 70  equity interest in the joint venture less the carrying amount of the contributed core mts business’ net assets of 1132 million  and 1258 million  of promissory notes a 136 million liability associated with a tax receivable agreement and transaction and other related expenses the 1258 million  of promissory notes were subsequently repaid in cash from proceeds of change healthcare’s long term debt issuance the gain is subject to final net working capital and other adjustments within 90 days from the transaction close date and is recorded in operating expenses within our technology solutions segment 

our investment in change healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting on a onemonth reporting lag we disclose intervening events at the joint venture in the lag period that could materially affect our consolidated financial statements if applicable in march 2017 our proportionate share of transaction expenses incurred by the joint venture is estimated to be approximately 80 million  to 120 million  however due to the timing of the transaction and the onemonth reporting lag no net income or loss from our investment was recorded in our financial results for 2017 commencing april 1 2017 our proportionate share of the net income or loss from the joint venture including these transaction expenses will be recorded in “other income net” in our consolidated statement of operations 

refer to financial note 2 “healthcare technology net asset exchange” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 excluding the gain on healthcare technology net asset exchange 2017 operating expenses increased primarily due to a noncash pretax charge of 290 million 282 million aftertax for goodwill impairment related to our eis business within our technology solutions segment and higher expenses due to our 2017 acquisitions in connection with the healthcare technology net asset exchange we are evaluating strategic options for our eis business 2017 operating expenses benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ongoing expense management efforts 2016 operating expenses decreased primarily due to pretax gains of 103 million from the sale of two businesses and lower acquisitionrelated expenses partially offset by pretax restructuring charges of 203 million relating to the 2016 cost alignment plan additionally 2015 operating expenses included a pretax and aftertax 150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the drug enforcement administration “dea” department of justice “doj” and various us attorney’s offices 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased in 2017  and 2016 compared with the prior years primarily due to lower operating expenses 

our reported income tax rates were 234  279  and 307  in 2017  2016  and 2015  income tax expense for 2017 included discrete income tax benefits of 54 million related to the early adoption of the amended accounting guidance on sharebased compensation in 2017 we sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our technology solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the mckesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions and recognized a net tax benefit of 137 million prior to the contribution of these assets to change healthcare

revenues 



revenues increased 4  and 7  in 2017  and 2016  compared to the same periods a year ago primarily driven by our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 99  of our consolidated revenues 

distribution solutions 

north america pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth higher revenues associated with our 2017 acquisitions including biologics vantage and rexall health and expanded business with existing customers these increases were partially offset by customer losses market growth includes growing drug utilization price increases and newly launched products partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion 

 international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6  in 2017 and decreased 11 in 2016 excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5 and 12 revenues increased 11 and 1 in 2017  and 2016 revenues increased in 2017 primarily due to market growth and our acquisition of udg revenue growth for 2016 primarily reflected increased revenues in the united kingdom due to a new distribution agreement with a manufacturer which was almost fully offset by lower revenues in norway associated with the loss of a hospital contract 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth revenues for 2017 also benefited from an acquisition and for 2016 were unfavorably affected by the sale of our zee medical business in the second quarter of 2016 

technology solutions 

technology solutions revenues for 2017 decreased primarily due to one less month of revenues from the core mts business which was contributed to change healthcare on march 1 2017 revenues decreased over the last two years primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues partially offset by higher revenues in our other businesses additionally 2016 revenues decreased as a result of the sale of our nurse triage business and the transition of our workforce business within our international technology business to a third party during the first quarter of 2016

distribution solutions segment’s gross profit decreased 1  in 2017  and remained flat in 2016  excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 2 and 4 gross profit increased 1 and 4 in 2017 and 2016 

gross profit margin for 2017 decreased primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends the competitive sellside pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our us pharmaceutical distribution business partially offset by lifo inventory credits higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements higher global procurement benefits and our 2017 acquisitions gross profit for 2017 also reflects the impact of previously announced customer consolidation activity gross profit margin for 2016 decreased primarily due to a lower sell margin within our north america distribution business driven by increased customer sales volume with some of our largest customers partially offset by lower lifo inventory charges gross profit margin over the last two years was favorably affected by benefits from our global procurement arrangements and higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers including the effects of price increases of both branded and generic drugs during 2017 and 2016 our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends which are expected to continue in 2018 

our lifo inventory credits were 7 million  in 2017 and lifo charges were 244 million  and 337 million  in 2016  and 2015  our north america distribution business uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory our annual lifo charge is affected by changes in yearend inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be influenced by market and other external factors changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual lifo credits or expense lifo credits were recognized in 2017 and lifo charge decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the impact of lower price increases as of march 31 2017 and 2016 pharmaceutical inventories at lifo did not exceed market

technology solutions 

technology solutions segment’s gross profit decreased in 2017 and remained flat in 2016 gross profit for 2017 decreased due to one less month of gross profit from the core mts business which was contributed to the joint venture on march 1 2017 this segment’s gross profit margin increased over the last two years 

gross profit margin for 2017 increased primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues lower severance charges ongoing cost management efforts and the prior year sales of businesses partially offset by a lower margin from our hospital software business gross profit margin for 2017 also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to the core mts business’ assets which were classified as held for sale since the second quarter of 2017 depreciation and amortization related to the longlived assets ceased as of the date they were determined as held for sale 

gross profit margin for 2016 benefited from the sale of our nurse triage business transitioning of our workforce business within our international technology business to a third party and higher pullthrough of deferred revenue these increases were partially offset by 49 million of pretax severance charges including charges associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan additionally in 2015 we recorded a 34 million pretax noncash charge representing a catchup in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our workforce business within our international technology business this business which was previously designated as a discontinued operation was reclassified to a continuing operation in 2015 when we decided to retain the business

the noncash pretax charge of 290 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our eis business within our technology solutions segment described in financial note 3 “goodwill impairment” had an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2017 given that the majority of this charge was not deductible for tax purposes 

on december 19 2016 we sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our technology solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the mckesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions the transferor entity recognized a gain on the sale of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction such gain was eliminated upon consolidation an entity based in the us was the recipient of the software and ancillary intellectual property and is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for book and tax purposes for us gaap purposes the tax benefit associated with the amortization of these assets is recognized over the tax lives of the assets as a result a net tax benefit of 137 million was recognized prior to the contribution of a portion of these assets to change healthcare as described in financial note 2 “healthcare technology net asset exchange” 

on march 1 2017 we contributed assets to change healthcare as further described in financial note 2 “healthcare technology net asset exchange” while this transaction was predominantly structured as a tax free asset contribution for us federal income tax purposes under section 721a of the internal revenue code we recorded tax expense of 929 million on the gain the tax expense was primarily driven by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the excess book over tax basis in our equity investment in change healthcare

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2017  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 542  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 202  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2017  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 337  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 178  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2017  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future 

at march 31 2017  trade and notes receivables were 14717 million prior to allowances of 243 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  our provision for bad debts was 93 million  113 million  and 67 million  at march 31 2017  and 2016  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 17 and 14 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2017  allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 15 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the firstin firstout method “fifo” technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method which approximates average cost rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 153 billion  at march 31 2017  and 2016  

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 70  and 74  of our inventories at march 31 2017  and 2016  if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement costs inventories would have been approximately 1005 million  and 1012 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2017  and 2016  these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products we recognized net lifo credits of 7 million  in 2017 and net lifo charges of 244  million and 337 million in 2016 and 2015 within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2017 and 2016 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives refer to financial note 4 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and intangible assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 10586 million  and 9786 million  of goodwill at march 31 2017  and 2016  and 3665 million  and 3021 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2017  and 2016  we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value no further evaluation is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss under the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangibles assets from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for that excess 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business under the income approach the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units the discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting units’ cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

in 2016 and 2015 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in 2017 we recorded a noncash pretax charge of 290 million   282 million  aftertax to impair the carrying value of our eis business estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any material changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans negative changes in government reimbursement rates deterioration in the us and global financial markets an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge our celesio reporting unit within our distribution solutions segment experienced a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily driven by government reimbursement reductions in our uk retail business the decline in estimated future cash flows resulted in the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit by 13 the goodwill balance of this reporting unit was 2790 million at march 31 2017 or approximately 26 of the total distribution segment’s goodwill balance a further decrease in the estimated future cash flows an increase in the discount rate and or a decrease in the terminal growth rate could result in a goodwill impairment for this reporting unit the discount rate and terminal growth rate used in our 2017 annual impairment testing for this reporting unit were 7 and 15 

currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 38 years we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2017  2016  or 2015  within our continuing operations our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2017  and 2016  supplier reserves were 201 million and 144 million the final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2017  and 2016  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2017  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 31 million in 2017  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1156 million  and 1272 million  and deferred tax liabilities of 4806 million  and 3947 million  at march 31 2017 and 2016 deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences relating to our compensation and benefit related accruals and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax liabilities have been established primarily due to excess book over tax basis in inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo intangible assets and our investment in change healthcare valuation allowances of 503 million  and 267 million  exist at march 31 2017  and 2016  against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 1 in our 2017 effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes of approximately 69 million for 2017  

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition we may access the longterm debt capital markets from time to time we are in the process of acquiring certain businesses and the cost of these acquisitions may be partially funded through the issuance of debt 

net cash flow from operating activities was 4744 million in 2017  compared to 3672 million  in 2016  and  3112 million  in 2015  operating activities over the last three years were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors additionally working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes inventory requirements and vendor payment terms operating activities for 2017 were also affected by 150 million of litigation settlement payment 

net cash used in investing activities was 3796 million  in 2017  compared to 1557 million  in 2016  and 677 million  in 2015  investing activities for 2017 include 4237 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions including 21 billion for our acquisition of rexall 1228 million  of net payments received on healthcare technology net asset exchange 404 million  and 158 million  in capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and capitalized software and 206 million  of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and other assets additionally we prepaid 14 billion for acquisitions that closed subsequent to year end

financing activities utilized 2069 million  3453 million  and 968 million  of cash in 2017  2016  and 2015  financing activities for 2017 include cash receipts of 8294 million  and payments of 8124 million  from shortterm borrowings we received cash from longterm debt issuances of 1824 million  and made repayments on longterm debt of 1601 million  in 2017 financing activities in 2017 also include 2250 million  of cash paid for stock repurchases and 253 million  of dividends paid 

financing activities for 2016 include cash receipts of 1561 million and payments of 1688 million from shortterm borrowings we made repayments on longterm debt of 1598 million in 2016 financing activities in 2016 also include 1504 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and 244 million of dividends paid 

financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of 3100 million and cash paid of 3152 million from shortterm borrowings longterm debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of 32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015 additionally financing activities for 2015 include 340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and 227 million of dividends paid 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of the company’s common stock up to 4 billion in october 2016 in 2017 we repurchased 141 million  of our shares through open market transactions and 14 million  of our shares through an asr program in 2016 we repurchased 87 million of our shares through both an asr program and open market transactions 



 at march 31 2017 the total authorization outstanding was 27 billion  available under the october 2016 share repurchase plan for future repurchases of the company’s common stock 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2017  included approximately 23 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations and acquisitions although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements 

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2017 compared to march 31 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance and an increase in drafts and accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities partially offset by increases in receivables consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2016 compared to march 31 2015 primarily due to increases in receivables and inventories and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable 

our debt to capital ratio improved for 2017 primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ equity and for 2016 primarily due to a decrease in our debt 

in july 2015 the quarterly dividend was raised from 024 to 028 per common share for dividends declared after such date until further action by the board dividends were 112  per share in 2017 108 per share in 2016 and 096 per share in 2015 the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2017  2016  and 2015  we paid total cash dividends of 253 million  244 million  and  227 million  additionally as required under the domination agreement we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €083 per celesio share effective january 1 2015 to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio

at march 31 2017 we have recorded a 136 million noncurrent liability payable to change healthcare shareholders associated with a tax receivable entered into in connection with healthcare technology net asset exchange the amount is based on certain estimates and could become payable in periods after a disposition of our investment in change healthcare 

our banks and insurance companies have issued 255  million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at march 31 2017 these were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs 

the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to celesio was 133 billion  at march 31 2017 which exceeded the maximum redemption value of 121 billion  the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement on december 2 2014 the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio received a put right that enables them to put their celesio shares to mckesson at €2299 per share which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the german bundesbank semiannually less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid “put amount” the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put amount are uncertain 

additionally we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €083 per celesio share the “compensation amount” to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination agreement which became effective in december 2014 the compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period the domination agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by mckesson without cause in writing no earlier than march 31 2020

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2017 and 2016 we had 28 billion  and 40 billion  and in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2017 and 2016 of approximately 19 million and 26 million 

foreign exchange risk   we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps the forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2017 and 2016 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 357 million and 131 million however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 21 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

other information about the business 

customers   during 2016  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 524  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 203  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2016  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 18  of total trade accounts receivable we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our distribution solutions segment 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 6 of our purchases in 2016  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers as a whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2016  accounted for approximately 44 of our purchases 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development   research and development costs were 392 million  392 million  and 457 million  during 2016  2015  and 2014  these costs do not include 30 million  34 million  and 40 million  of costs capitalized for software held for sale during 2016  2015  and 2014  development expenditures are primarily incurred by our technology solutions segment our technology solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers we believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our development activities is included in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 24 “commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

mckesson corporation 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2016  and is not expected to be material in the next year

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies reduce costs and improve patient outcomes these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels changes in the basis for payments shifting away from feeforservice and towards valuebased payments and risksharing models increases in the use of managed care consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation consequently our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases declines which we do not control in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation during 2016 our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends which are expected to continue in 2017 continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the nature frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations additionally any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

mckesson corporation 

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised subject to rulemaking the federal upper limits “ful” for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis on january 21 2016 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” released the covered outpatient drugs final rule with comment the final rule with limited exceptions establishes the ful to be 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process states had until may 2016 to implement the fuls additionally the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist’s professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component use of the revised ampbased ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for example under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price “asp” plus 6 the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation as another example the medicare access and chip reauthorization act “macra” signed into law in april 2015 seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers most notably macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula instead after a period of stable payment updates macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions including extending the children’s health insurance program additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding distribution and disposal of controlled substances 

as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities in some instances these can lead to monetary penalties andor license revocation in march 2015 we reached an agreement in principle with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we agreed to pay the sum of 150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances 

although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable lotlevel prescription drug track and trace system the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy   state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although we modified our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 new laws and regulations in this area could further restrict our or our customers’ ability to obtain use or disseminate personal or patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products or services in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customer these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims tort damages fines and penalties costs for remediation media attention and harm to our customer relationships and reputation 

healthcare reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement andor finalize eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations however given the scope of the changes made and under consideration as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time 

mckesson corporation 

interoperability and meaningful use requirement  there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare information technology products provided by various vendors be compatible with each other in 2013 in order to address this demand for interoperability we and a number of other healthcare information technology “it” companies cofounded the commonwell health alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among doctors hospitals clinics and pharmacies certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies or used by our customers with respect to legislation addressing interoperability macra promotes and defines interoperability requires metrics to measure interoperability and requires vendors and providers to attest that they are not blocking data regarding meaningful use requirements the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government further the 21st century cures bill that passed the us house of representatives last year contained language focused on promoting greater interoperability of health it specifically the bill creates penalties for socalled “information blocking” by it vendors or providers the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda’s jurisdiction but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a casebycase basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety finally the bill included additional funding for the national institutes of health and the fda the senate is currently considering similar legislation with final passage possible this year 

although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future as a result of interoperability and meaningful requirements we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems that regulates certain software that electronically stores transfers or displays data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices themselves ie those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls however in february 2015 the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems medical image storage devices and medical image communication devices if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products once issued may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products the 21st century cures bill would also change the way health it would be regulated by the fda the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda’s jurisdiction but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a casebycase basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety the senate is currently considering similar legislation with final passage probable this year 

standards for submission of healthcare claims  hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement the first rule modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” the compliance date for icd10 conversion was postponed from october 1 2014 to october 1 2015 updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems as the healthcare industry moves towards compliance with these rules in addition these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with these rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries the company’s acquisition of celesio ag “celesio” significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for instance to reduce the cost for taxpayers provincial governments have taken steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit

general european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the company’s acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and accordingly our exposure to economic conditions in europe a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in europe we are subject to the 1995 european union “eu” directive on data protection “1995 data protection directive” which requires eu member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security in addition certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards the company had addressed these requirements by certification to the useu safe harbor frameworks prior to such frameworks being invalidated in october 2015 by the european court of justice although recent negotiations between the us and the eu have yielded the likely successor to the safe harbor framework the euus privacy shield this new framework has not yet been approved by all of the necessary eu regulatory bodies in the interim we are pursuing alternative methods of compliance but those methods may be subject to scrutiny by data protection authorities in eu member states on december 15 2015 the european parliament and the council of the european union council reached a political agreement on the future eu data protection legal framework subject to formal adoption by the european parliament in the first half of 2016 the general data protection regulation “gdpr” will replace the 1995 data protection directive although the gdpr has not yet been finalized and minor modifications remain possible the gdpr will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of eu individuals the gdpr is expected to become effective sometime in 2018 two years after its final adoption in 2016 the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our results of operations which are stated in us dollars could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the us dollar we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks additionally we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place 

mckesson corporation 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

on february 6 2014 we completed the acquisition of 776 of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio upon the acquisition our ownership of celesio’s fully diluted shares was 756 celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors on december 2 2014 we obtained the ability to pursue the integration of the two companies upon the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement the “domination agreement” 

achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio’s products and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of its realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial position and operating results events outside of our control including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio 

our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives for example during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust class actions commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

our distribution solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty distributors service merchandisers selfwarehousing chain drug stores manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment in all areas key competitive factors include price quality of service breadth of product lines innovation and in some cases convenience to the customer 

in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market accordingly we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many of our customers including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues among our customers suppliers and competitors it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services it would also increase counterparty credit risk as the number of market participants decreases in addition when our customers combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many companies including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered 

these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2016  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 524  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 203  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2016  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 18  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the us false claims act the procurement integrity act the buy american act and the trade agreements act we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and oversight proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations although we and our customers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems a failure or compromise of our or our customers’ computer systems from a cyberattack natural disaster or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information protected health information financial information and confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data that we process store and transmit may travel outside of the united states additionally we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide 

despite our implementation of a variety of security measures our and our customers’ computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access such as physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering like other global companies we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems including malware and ransomware attacks unauthorized access system failures and disruptions 

a failure or compromise of our or our customers’ computer systems may jeopardize the confidential proprietary and sensitive information processed stored and transmitted through such computer systems such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation financial losses litigation increased costs regulatory penalties customer attrition brand impairment or other business harm these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although we maintain liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprise‑wide and single entity clinical patient care financial supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in healthcare information technology could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information technology marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products and services on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products and services on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or services obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our software and technology services may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if clinicians’ use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

mckesson corporation 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyber attacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our contractors or third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

mckesson corporation 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow additionally if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues it may adversely impact our tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations for example we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes “vat” the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission’s investigations into illegal state aid changes to longstanding tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 and 2015 primarily represents the guaranteed dividends and the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination agreement net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 primarily represents the portion of celesio’s net loss that was not allocable to mckesson corporation refer to financial note 10 “noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

net income attributable to mckesson corporation net income attributable to mckesson corporation was 2258 million  1476 million  and 1263 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  and diluted earnings per common share were 970  627  and 541

foreign operations 

our foreign operations represented approximately 17 20 and 11 of our consolidated revenues in 2016  2015  and 2014  foreign operations are subject to certain risks including currency fluctuations we monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate we conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar as a result the comparability of our results reported in us dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in discussing our operating results we may use the term “foreign currency effect” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar we present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations in computing foreign currency effect we translate our current year results in local currencies into us dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in us dollars additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in financial note 27 “segments of business” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes general and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2016  sales to our ten  largest customers including group purchasing organizations “gpos” accounted for approximately 524  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs health “cvs” accounted for approximately 203  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2016  trade accounts receivable from our ten  largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 18  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists a material default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2016  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future 

at march 31 2016  trade and notes receivables were 14685 million prior to allowances of 212 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  our provision for bad debts was 113 million  67 million  and 36 million  at march 31 2016  and 2015  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 14 and 11 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2016  allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 15 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the firstin firstout method “fifo” technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method which approximates average cost rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 153 billion  and 143 billion  at march 31 2016  and 2015  

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 74  and 73  of our inventories at march 31 2016  and 2015  if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement costs inventories would have been approximately 1012 million  and 768 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2016 and 2015 these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized net lifo expense of 244 million  337  million and 311 million within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market as of march 31 2016 and 2015 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and intangible assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 9786 million  and 9817 million  of goodwill at march 31 2016  and 2015  and 3021 million  and 3441 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2016  and 2015  we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value no further evaluation is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss under the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangibles assets from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for that excess 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge in 2016 2015 and 2014 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to thirtyeight years we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2016  2015  or 2014  within our continuing operations our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2016  and 2015  supplier reserves were 144 million and 167 million the final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2016  and 2015  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2016  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 29 million in 2016  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1272 million  and 1189 million  at march 31 2016  and 2015  and deferred tax liabilities of 3947 million  and 3791 million  deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and intangible assets we established valuation allowances of 267 million  and 229 million  for 2016  and 2015  against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 1 in our 2016 effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes of approximately 33 million for 2016  

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims including claims with customers and vendors pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations and our shortterm investment portfolio together with our existing sources of liquidity from our revolving credit facilities accounts receivable factoring facilities and commercial paper issuance will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition we may access the longterm debt capital markets from time to time we are in the process of acquiring certain businesses and the cost of these acquisitions may be partially funded through the issuance of debt 

net cash flow from operating activities was 3672 million in 2016  compared to 3112 million  in 2015  and  3136 million  in 2014  operating activities over the last three years were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors additionally working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes inventory requirements and vendor payment terms 

net cash used in investing activities was 1557 million  in 2016  compared to 677 million  in 2015  and 5046 million  in 2014  investing activities for 2016 include 40 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions 488 million  and 189 million  in capital expenditures for property plant and equipment and capitalized software and 210 million  of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses additionally we prepaid 939 million for acquisitions that closed subsequent to year end

financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of 3100 million  and payments of 3152 million  from shortterm borrowings longterm debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of 32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015 additionally financing activities for 2015 include 340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and 227 million  of dividends paid 

financing activities for 2014 include cash receipts of 6080 million  and cash paid of 6132 million  from shortterm borrowings which includes 4957 million in borrowings under a senior bridge loan facility in connection with our acquisition of celesio and 400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in february 2014 these borrowings were fully repaid in march 2014 financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of 4124 million  from the issuance of longterm debt in march 2014 and cash paid of 348 million for repayments of longterm debt additionally financing activities for 2014 included 130 million of cash payments for stock repurchases and 214 million of dividends paid 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of the company’s common stock up to 2 billion in october 2015 and up to 500 million in may 2015 in 2016 we repurchased 87 million of our shares through both an asr program and open market transactions and in 2015 repurchased 15 million of our shares all through open market transactions all share repurchases were funded with cash on hand

 at march 31 2016 the total authorization outstanding was 10 billion available under the october 2015 share repurchase plan for future repurchases of the company’s common stock 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31 2016  included approximately 22 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations and acquisitions as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements 

consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2016 compared to march 31 2015 primarily due to increases in receivables and inventories and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2015 compared to march 31 2014 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates at march 31 2016 we had 35 million in outstanding debt with variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2016 we had 4 billion  in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2016 and 2015 of approximately 26 million and 19 million 

foreign exchange risk   we conduct our business worldwide in us dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries including euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in us dollars we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps the forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk 

as of march 31 2016 and 2015 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 131 million and 223 million however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 20 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels increases in the use of managed care consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drugs available in the marketplace in fiscal year 2016 we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technologyrelated products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse local state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” has proposed new rules for calculating amp “revised amp” and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost “aac” method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark “nadac” under aac and nadac reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric such as aac or nadac would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

mckesson corporation 

the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for example under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price “asp” plus 6 the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation as another example the medicare access and chip reauthorization act “macra” signed into law in april 2015 seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers most notably macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula instead after a period of stable payment updates macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions including extending the children’s health insurance program additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale for example we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel registrations and licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances 

as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities in some instances these can lead to monetary penalties andor license revocation in march 2015 we reached an agreement in principle with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we agreed to pay the sum of 150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances 

although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system otherwise known as pedigree tracking in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable lotlevel prescription drug track and trace system the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

privacy   state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although we modified our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 new laws and regulations in this area could further restrict our or our customers’ ability to obtain use or disseminate personal or patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products or systems in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customer these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims tort damages fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

healthcare reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations however given the scope of the changes made and under consideration as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time 

interoperability and meaningful use requirement  there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other in 2013 in order to address this demand for interoperability we and a number of other healthcare it companies cofounded the commonwell health alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among doctors hospitals clinics and pharmacies certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies or used by our customers with respect to legislation addressing interoperability macra promotes and defines interoperability requires metrics to measure interoperability and requires vendors and providers to attest that they are not blocking data regarding meaningful use requirements the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government 

although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future as a result of interoperability and meaningful requirements we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems that regulates certain software systems that electronically store transfer or display data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices ie those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls themselves however in february 2015 the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems medical image storage devices and medical image communication devices if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products once issued may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products

standards for submission of healthcare claims  hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement the first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” as a consequence of the passage of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 the compliance date for icd10 conversion has been postponed from october 1 2014 to october 1 2015 updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 when required will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules in addition these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems 

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries the company’s acquisition of celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs similar to the united states provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs for example in 2006 the government of ontario considerably revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act in recent years to reduce the cost for taxpayers provincial governments have taken further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

general european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the company’s acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and accordingly our exposure to economic conditions in europe a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures for example in 2011 the french government introduced a new wholesale markup system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in europe we are subject to the european union “eu” data protection regulations including the eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security in addition to this euwide legislation certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards the company has addressed these requirements by certification to the useu safe harbor frameworks the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our results of operations which are stated in us dollars could be adversely impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 

as all of celesio’s revenues are generated outside of the united states the company’s acquisition of celesio significantly increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks these risks include uncertainty regarding the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the euro and the norwegian krone that could adversely impact our results of operations and capital ratios based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar fluctuating exchange rates cause the value of items on both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet to change which could also negatively impact our results of operations our financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

on february 6 2014 we completed the acquisition of 776 of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio upon the acquisition our ownership of celesio’s fully diluted shares was 756 celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors on december 2 2014 we obtained the ability to pursue the integration of the two companies upon the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement the “domination agreement” 

achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio’s product and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of its realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial position and operating results events outside of our control including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio 

mckesson corporation 

our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives for example during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from timetotime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation 

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

in recent years pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2015  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs caremark corporation “cvs”  accounted for approximately 15  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2015  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 14  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment change in our customer mix reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act and the cost accounting standards we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including disallowance of costs claimed monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems the malfunction failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers in europe celesio outsources a significant part of its it infrastructure to an external service provider if these systems are interrupted damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party including a cyber attack or fail for any extended period of time it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we sustain cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the us due to our information technology systems and international business operations we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities our systems and the data we store on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft coordinated attacks by activist entities misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer’s data 

the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses which include care management programs and our nurse advice services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although celesio maintains liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if celesio’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprise‑wide and single entity clinical patient care financial supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or technology obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our software and technology services may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software and technology services lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyber attacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our contractors or third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow additionally if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues it may adversely impact our tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations for example we operate in various countries which collect value added taxes “vat” the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow

we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities 

we participate in various multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability in addition such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to our february 2014 acquisition of celesio ag “celesio” and february 2013 acquisition of pss world medical inc “pssi” as well as due to market growth and our mix of business market growth reflects growing drug utilization which includes newly launched drugs and price increases increases in revenues were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

gross profit and gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions higher buy margin and our mix of business partially offset by a decrease in sell margin additionally gross profit was impacted by higher liforelated inventory charges which were 337 million  311 million  and 13 million  in 2015 2014 and 2013 

operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions including increases in acquisitionrelated expenses and higher intangible asset amortization and higher compensation and benefit costs operating expenses in 2015 also included a pretax and aftertax 150 million  charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the drug enforcement administration “dea” department of justice “doj” and various us attorney’s offices and in 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included 68 million  and 72 million  of charges associated with our average wholesale price “awp” litigation additionally operating expenses for 2013 were favorably impacted by an 81 million  noncash gain on a business combination related to our purchase of the remaining 50 ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business which we acquired through our acquisition of celesio financial results for this business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements as a result loss from discontinued operations net of tax for 2015 includes 241 million  pretax  235 million  aftertax noncash impairment charges to writeoff the business’ longlived assets and reduce the carrying value of this business to its fair value less costs to sell 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax for 2014 included a noncash pretax and aftertax impairment charge of 80 million related to our international technology business which was sold in part in 2015 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily reflects the 62 million of guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation that mckesson is obligated to pay the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement the “domination agreement” which became effective in december 2014 as further described below 

net income attributable to mckesson corporation was  1476  million  1263  million and 1338  million in 2015 2014 and 2013 diluted earnings per common share attributable to mckesson corporation from continuing operations were 754  608  and 569  and diluted loss per common share attributable to mckesson corporation from discontinued operations were 127  067  and 010  in 2015 2014 and 2013 

on february 6 2014 we completed the acquisition of 776  of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio for cash consideration of 45 billion  net of cash acquired the “acquisition” upon the acquisition as required we consolidated celesio’s debt with a fair value of 23 billion  as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and our ownership of celesio’s fully diluted common shares was 756  we owned approximately 754  of celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares at march 31 2014 financial results for celesio are included within our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business which is part of our distribution solutions segment since the date of acquisition

revenues 



revenues for 2015  increased 30  to 1790 billion  from 2014 and revenues for 2014 increased 12  to 1374 billion  from 2013 increases in our revenues were primarily driven by our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 98  of our consolidated revenues 

distribution solutions 

north america pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth and our mix of business market growth reflects growing drug utilization which includes newly launched drugs and price increases in particular our 2015 revenues benefited from newly launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis c these increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

 international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were 264 billion  and 45 billion  in 2015 and 2014 representing revenues from celesio which was acquired in february 2014 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth additionally revenues increased in 2014 as a result of our february 2013 acquisition of pssi 

technology solutions 

technology solutions revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in software products and services revenues the planned elimination of a product line and lower revenues from the workforce business within our international technology business which we will transition to another service provider during the first quarter of 2016 these decreases were partially offset by higher volume in our transaction processing businesses 

technology solutions revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions and higher volumes in our transaction processing businesses partially offset by a decrease in software products and services revenues

distribution solutions 

distribution solutions gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily reflecting our business acquisitions and higher buy margin within our north american distribution business partially offset by a decrease in sell margin primarily driven by higher sales volume and an increase in liforelated inventory charges buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers gross profit margin for 2015 was also unfavorably affected by the increased sales associated with newly launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis c gross profit margin for 2014 was also favorably affected by growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs 

our liforelated inventory expense was 337 million  in 2015 311 million  in 2014 and 13 million  in 2013 our north american distribution business uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory our annual lifo expense is affected by expected changes in yearend inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be influenced by market and other external influences changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual lifo expense 

as a result of cumulative net price deflation at march 31 2013 pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 60 million more than market and accordingly a 60 million lowerofcost or market “lcm” reserve reduced inventories to market in 2015 and 2014 we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories and liforelated charges were incurred and in 2014 the 60 million lcm reserve was fully released resulting in an increase in gross profit as of march 31 2015 and 2014 pharmaceutical inventories at lifo did not exceed market additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review

technology solutions 

technology solutions gross profit margin decreased in 2015 primarily due to a 34 million pretax charge representing a catchup in depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when certain assets were classified as heldforsale and our mix of business these decreases were partially offset by the planned elimination of a product line and lower product alignment charges gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues partially offset by higher product alignment charges 

 in 2014 we committed to a plan to sell our international technology and hospital automation businesses from our technology solutions segment as required we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in 2014 and depreciation and amortization expense was not recognized as the assets were heldforsale during the first quarter of 2015 we decided to retain the workforce business within our international technology business as a result we reclassified the workforce business which had been designated as a discontinued operation during 2014 as a continuing operation for all periods presented additionally we recorded a pretax charge of 34 million as a catchup of depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when the assets were classified as heldforsale 

in 2014 the segment recorded pretax charges totaling 57 million these charges primarily consisted of 35 million of product alignment charges 15 million of integrationrelated expenses and 7 million of reductioninworkforce severance charges included in the total charge was 35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development customer services and sales functions and 15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the writeoff of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows 34 million in cost of sales and 23 million in operating expenses 

in 2013 this segment recorded 46 million of noncash pretax impairment charges these charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product the charge included a 36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value in addition the goodwill had a nominal tax basis this impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations the balance of the charge represents a 10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value we concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs were insufficient to recover its carrying value this impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2015  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs caremark corporation “cvs”  accounted for approximately 15  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2015  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 14  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2015  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

at march 31 2015  trade and notes receivables were 13275 million prior to allowances of 141 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  our provision for bad debts was 67 million  36 million  and 28 million at march 31 2015  and 2014  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 11 and 09 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2015  allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 13 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the firstin firstout method “fifo” technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method which approximates average cost rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 143 billion  and 130 billion  at march 31 2015  and 2014  

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 73  and 67  of our inventories at march 31 2015  and 2014  if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement costs inventories would have been approximately 768 million and 431 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2015 and 2014 these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2015  2014  and 2013  we recognized net lifo expense of 337 million 311  million and 13 million within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market due to cumulative net price deflation from 2005 to 2013 we had a lowerofcost or market “lcm” reserve of 60 million at march 31 2013 which reduced pharmaceutical inventories at lifo to market during 2014 the lcm reserve of 60 million was released resulting in an increase in gross profit as of march 31 2014 and 2015 inventories at lifo did not exceed market 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained of a business 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and intangible assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 9817 million  and 9927 million  of goodwill at march 31 2015  and 2014  and 3441 million  and 4871 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2015  and 2014  we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value no further evaluation is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss under the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangibles assets from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for that excess 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge in 2015 and 2014 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in 2013 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 36 million in our technology solutions segment 

currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to thirtyeight years we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2015  2014  or 2013  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2015  and 2014  supplier reserves were 167 million and 181 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2015  and 2014  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2015  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 25 million in 2015  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1189 million  and 1286 million  at march 31 2015  and 2014  and deferred tax liabilities of 3791 million  and 4075 million  deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and intangible assets we established valuation allowances of 229 million and 200 million  for 2015  and 2014  against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 27 million or 011 per diluted share for 2015  

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate

financial review continued 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of the company’s common stock in january 2013 in 2015 and 2013 we repurchased 15 million and 13 million of our shares through an asr program and open market repurchases 



 at march 31 2015 no authorized amounts remain available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under the january 2013 board approved share purchase plan 

in may 2015 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of the company’s common stock 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for 217 million by the company the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings as such 195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

financial review continued 

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2015  included approximately 23 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements 

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2015  compared to march 31 2014  primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2014 compared to march 31 2013 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and increases in receivables and inventories partially offset by increases in current portion of longterm debt associated with our acquisition of celesio 

our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at march 31 2015  compared to march 31 2014  primarily due to a decrease in total debt partially offset by the decrease in total mckesson stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2014  compared to march 31 2013  primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our celesio acquisition 

in july 2013 the quarterly dividend was raised from 020 to 024 per common share for dividends declared after such date until further action by the board dividends were 096 per share in 2015 092 per share in 2014 and 080 per share in 2013 the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2015  2014  and 2013  we paid total cash dividends of 227 million  214 million  and  194 million  additionally as required under the domination agreement we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €083 per celesio share effective january 1 2015 to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio

contractual obligations 

the table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at march 31 2015  



 the contractual obligations table above excludes the following liabilities 

at march 31 2015 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 616 million the ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty 

at march 31 2015  our banks and insurance companies have issued 142 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs 

at march 31 2015 the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to celesio was 14 billion  which exceeded the maximum redemption value of 12 billion  the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement on december 2 2014 the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio received a put right that enables them to put their celesio shares to mckesson at €2299 per share which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the german bundesbank semiannually less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid “put amount” the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put amount are uncertain refer to financial notes 2 and 3 “business combinations” and “noncontrolling interests” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates at march 31 2015 we had 07 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2015 we had 53 billion in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2015 and 2014 of approximately 19 million and 12 million 

foreign exchange risk   the majority of our operations are conducted in u s dollars however certain assets and liabilities revenues and expense and purchasing activities are incurred in and exposed to other currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk 

as of march 31 2015 and 2014 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately 223 million and 134 million however our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 19 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forwardexchange contracts 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

other information about the business 

customers   during 2014  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs caremark corporation cvs  accounted for approximately 16  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2014  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 12  of total trade accounts receivable we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers the accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the gpos substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our distribution solutions segment 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 6  of our purchases in 2014  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2014  accounted for approximately 46  of our purchases 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development   research and development costs were 456 million 433 million and 402 million during 2014  2013  and 2012  these costs do not include 40 million 49 million and 47 million of costs capitalized for software held for sale during 2014  2013  and 2012  development expenditures are primarily incurred by our technology solutions segment our technology solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers we believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our development activities is included in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation our operations are subject to regulations under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

mckesson corporation 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 22 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2014  and is not expected to be material in the next year 

employees   on march 31 2014  we employed approximately 42800 persons and celesio employed approximately 28600 persons we employed approximately 43500 and 37700 on march 31 2013  and 2012

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace in fiscal year 2015 we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computerrelated products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

mckesson corporation 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse and the government both state and federal continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” has proposed new rules for calculating amp “revised amp” and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost “aac” method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark “nadac” under aac and nadac reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric such as aac or nadac would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for example under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price “asp” plus 6 the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration the “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale in addition and as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system “pedigree tracking” in november 2013 congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act “dqsa” the dqsa will establish federal standards requiring supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable lotlevel prescription drug track and trace system the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy   state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although we modified our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 new laws and regulations in this area could restrict our or our customers’ ability to obtain use or disseminate personal or patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

healthcare reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however given the scope of the changes made and under consideration as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time 

mckesson corporation 

interoperability standards and meaningful use requirement  there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other this demand for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups such as commonwell health alliance which the company and other healthcare it companies announced in 2013 certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies or used by our customers for example the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification while others are on track to receive certification rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future as a result we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these rules subsequently are changed or supplemented or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems mdds that now regulates certain software systems that electronically store transfer or display data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices ie those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls themselves if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products once issued may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 

standards for submission of healthcare claims  hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement the first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule was extended through june 30 2012 and many healthcare providers began implementing the 5010 rule the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” as a consequence of the passage of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 in march the compliance date for icd10 conversion has been postponed from october 1 2014 to october 1 2015 updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions eg eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 when required will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules in addition these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems 

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs similar to the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs for example the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act in recent years to reduce the cost for taxpayers various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in europe we are subject to the european union “eu” data protection regulations including the eu directive on data protection which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security in addition to this euwide legislation certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries the company’s acquisition of celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth 

our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies unexpected regulatory social political or economic changes in a specific country or region changes in intellectual property privacy and data protection importexport regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes labor strikes acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations including uncertainty regarding the euro the canadian dollar the british pound sterling and the brazilian real that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar since substantially all of celesio’s revenues are generated outside of the united states the company’s acquisition of celesio significantly increases our exposure to these risks 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions the uk bribery act for example prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both private and public sectors an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the uk bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues for example the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the us from overseas plants due to quality issues difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

on february 6 2014 we completed the acquisition of 776 of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio upon the acquisition our ownership of celesio’s fully diluted shares was 756 at march 31 2014 we owned approximately 754 of celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors celesio’s headquarters is in stuttgart germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world the acquisition of celesio expands our global geographic area the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide 

achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including foreign exchange fluctuations challenges of managing new international operations and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio’s product and services the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or if realized the timing of their realization it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition 

any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results both prior to and after the acquisition of celesio moreover the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial condition operating results and prospects events outside of our control including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition changes in regulations and laws as well as economic trends could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio 

mckesson corporation 

the process to obtain operational control of celesio including celesio shareholder approval of the domination and profit and loss agreement and registration of the domination and profit and loss agreement in the celesio corporate register is complex and we do not expect to complete the steps required to exercise operating control of celesio until late in the first half of our fiscal 2015 until the domination and profit and loss agreement is registered and effective celesio will not be subject to direct management control by us and celesio’s profits can only be distributed by the declaration of dividends in the event that a minority shareholder of celesio files an action to challenge the registration or the registration is delayed by german courts it may prevent us from exercising operational control of celesio on the anticipated timeline or at all our pursuit of the celesio acquisition and the preparation for the integration of celesio’s business over an extended period of time may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources as well as the management and internal resources of celesio in the event that our acquisition of celesio’s remaining then outstanding common shares is significantly delayed it may prevent the celesio acquisition from being consummated on the anticipated timeline which could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock and could result in our incurring significant expenses related to the celesio acquisition without realizing the expected benefits 

we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from time totime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving false claims healthcare fraud and abuse antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property regulatory tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation 

european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the company’s acquisition of celesio significantly increases our assets and operations within europe and accordingly our exposure to economic conditions in europe a further slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures for example in 2011 the french government introduced a new wholesale markup system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay 

countries with existing healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed healthcarerelated austerity measures may impose them in the future new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from international national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

in recent years pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers many healthcare organizations have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2014  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs  accounted for approximately 16  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2014  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 12  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment change in our customer mix reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act and the cost accounting standards we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems the malfunction failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers in europe celesio outsources its it infrastructure to an external service provider if these systems are interrupted damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party including a cyber attack or fail for any extended period of time it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information the corruption of data or other disruption of business operations similarly denialofservice or other internetbased attacks may range from mere vandalism of electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property although we actively devote significant resources to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information in our possession preventing all cyber incidents is inherently difficult therefore any compromise of our electronic systems including the unauthorized access use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks would adversely affect our reputation our ability to fulfill contractual obligations and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations moreover unauthorized access use or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in a civil criminal or regulatory action including potential fines and penalties any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may also result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future 

mckesson corporation 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses which include care management programs and our nurse advice services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs although celesio maintains liability insurance the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims if celesio’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprise‑wide and single entity clinical patient care financial supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or technology obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and technology services “systems” that we sell or operate are complex as with complex systems offered by others our systems may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s business systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyber attacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

mckesson corporation 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow additionally if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues it may adversely impact our tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge even if we are successful in maintaining our positions we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our 135 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in november 2014 historically we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements as needed we anticipate extending or renewing this facility before its expiration although we believe we will be able to renew this facility there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from timetotime we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make an additional cash contribution to the plans payable in installments andor lump sum our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability in addition such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2014  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs caremark corporation cvs  accounted for approximately 16  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2014  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  were approximately 12  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2014  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue

the lifo method was used to value approximately 67  and 80  of our inventories at march 31 2014  and 2013  if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement costs inventories would have been approximately 431 million and 120 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31 2014 and 2013 these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2014  2013  and 2012  we recognized net lifo expense of 311  million 13  million and 11  million within our consolidated statements of operations a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 60 million higher than market as of march 31 2013  as a result we recorded a lcm credit of 60 million and 16  million in 2014  and 2013  within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our lifo inventories to market 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained of a business 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and intangible assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 9927 million  and 6405 million  of goodwill at march 31 2014  and 2013  and 5022 million  and 2270 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2014  and 2013  we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit components that have essentially similar operations products services customers and operating margin are aggregated as a single reporting unit management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing

the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value no further evaluation is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss under the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangibles assets from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for that excess 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge in 2014 and 2012 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in 2013 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 36 million in our technology solutions segment for our newlyacquired celesio operations we determined the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using various methods including an overall discounted cash flow analysis performed for all of celesio’s operations as of march 31 2014 the fair value assignments were preliminary and could change significantly upon finalization of the fair value assignments 

currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to thirtyeight years we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2014  2013  or 2012  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2014  and 2013  supplier reserves were 181 million and 164 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2014  and 2013  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2014  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 22 million in 2014  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1332 million  and 1247 million  at march 31 2014  and 2013  and deferred tax liabilities of 4133 million  and 3114 million  deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and intangible assets we established valuation allowances of 270 million  and 118 million  for 2014  and 2013  against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 21 million or 009 per diluted share for 2014  

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

mckesson corporation

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facilities revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition we may access the longterm debt capital markets from timetotime 

net cash flow from operating activities was  3136 million in 2014  compared to  2483 million  in 2013  and  2950 million  in 2012  operating activities for 2014  were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases operating activities for 2014 also reflect increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors 

operating activities for 2013  were primarily affected by 483 million of payments made for awp litigation settlements operating activities for 2012  reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth 

net cash used in investing activities was 5046 million  in 2014  compared to 2209 million  in 2013  and 1502 million  in 2012  investing activities for 2014  included 4634 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions including 4497 million for our acquisition of celesio investing activities in 2014 also included 274 million  and 141 million  in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software investing activities for 2014 also reflect 97 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment

investing activities for 2012  included 1051 million  of net cash payments for acquisitions including 919 million for our acquisition of the katz assets investing activities in 2012 also included 221 million and 177 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software 

financing activities generated cash of 3619 million  in 2014  compared to net cash usage of 956 million  in 2013  and 1905 million  in 2012  financing activities for 2014  include cash receipts of 788 million and cash paid of 765 million from shortterm borrowings in connection with our acquisition of celesio we also borrowed 4957 billion million under a senior bridge loan facility and 400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in february 2014 these borrowings were fully repaid in march 2014 financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of 4114 million from the issuance of longterm debt in march 2014 and cash paid of 356 for repayments of longterm debt primarily consisting of 350 million paid on the maturity of our 650 notes due in february 2014 additionally financing activities for 2014  included 130 million  of cash paid for stock repurchases and 214 million  of dividends paid

financing activities for 2013 included cash receipts of 1325 million and cash paid of 1725 million from shortterm borrowings in addition in connection with our acquisition of pss world medical we borrowed 900 million for bridge financing in february 2013 which was fully repaid in march 2013 financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of 1798 million for the issuance of longterm debt and cash paid of 1143 million for repayments of longterm debt in december 2012 we issued 500 million of 095 notes due 2015 and 400 million of 270 notes due 2022 in march 2013 we issued 500 million of 140 notes due 2018 and 400 million of 285 notes dues 2023 longterm debt repayments include 500 million paid on the maturity of our 525 notes due in march 2013 and 635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of pss world medical additionally financing activities for 2013 included 1214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and 194 million of dividends paid 

financing activities for 2012  included 1874 million of cash paid for share repurchases 400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 775 notes in february 2012 195 million of dividends paid 400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and 167 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of the company’s common stock as follows 10 billion in april 2010 10 billion in october 2010 10 billion in april 2011 650 million in january 2012 700 million in april 2012 and 500 million in january 2013 total share repurchases transacted through asr programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows 



 the total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the company’s common stock was 340 million at march 31 2014 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for 217 million by the company the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings as such 195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 



 cash equivalents which are availableforsale are carried at fair value cash equivalents are primarily invested in aaa rated prime and us government money market funds denominated in us dollars aaa rated prime money market funds denominated in euros overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by us treasury bonds canadian government securities andor securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the us government and an aaa rated prime money market fund denominated in british pound sterling 

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions deposits at us banks exceed the amount insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds within the celesio operations the majority of deposits are placed in germany with only banks that are part of deposit protection programs 

our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2014  included approximately 24 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements 

consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2014  compared to march 31 2013  primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and increases in receivables inventories and current portion of longterm debt associated with our acquisition of celesio consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2013  compared to march 31 2012  primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance 

our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2014  compared to march 31 2013  primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our celesio acquisition our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2013  compared to march 31 2012  primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance 

in july 2013 the quarterly dividend was raised from 020 to 024 per common share for dividends declared after such date until further action by the board dividends were 092 per share in 2014 and 080 per share in 2013 and 2012 the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2014  2013  and 2012  we paid total cash dividends of  214 million   194 million  and  195 million

contractual obligations 

the table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at march 31 2014  



 at march 31 2014 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 489 million since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table 

in addition at march 31 2014  our banks and insurance companies have issued 161 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs

celesio debt 

upon our acquisition of celesio as required we consolidated a total of 23 billion of outstanding debt of celesio as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet the celesio debt consists primarily of corporate bonds convertible debt promissory notes and amounts outstanding under their accounts receivable facility arrangements and lines of credits debt maturities range from our fiscal years 2015 to 2024 as of march 31 2014 celesio convertible debt of 344 million  was extinguished through the issuance of celesio common stock or cash as of march 31 2014 246 million  and 188 million were outstanding under the accounts receivable factoring facility arrangements and lines of credits with committed balances of 308 million and 1662 million

accounts receivable sales facility 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility the “facility” with a committed balance of 135 billion although from timetotime the available amount of the facility may be less than 135 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements prior to the celesio acquisition we amended the facility to extend the term for an additional year increased the maximum debt to capital ratio from 565 to 65 and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the facility relating to celesio the facility will expire in november 2014 and we anticipate renewing the facility before its expiration

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates at march 31 2014 we had 10 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates at march 31 2014 we had 42 billion in cash and cash equivalents the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents net of shortterm borrowings and variable rate debt would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2014 of approximately 12 million 

foreign exchange risk   historically we have recorded foreign revenues and earnings primarily from canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries and israel which exposed us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our acquisition of a majority interest in celesio in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded our portfolio of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts as substantially all revenues and earnings of celesio are generated outside of the united states changes in the us dollar relative to the functional currency in the countries in which celesio operates primarily the euro and the british pound could impact future earnings we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans 

as of march 31 2014 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of celesio’s foreign exchange contracts by approximately 94 million as of march 31 2014 the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10 change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our remaining foreign exchange contracts by approximately 40 million however celesio’s risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure refer to financial note 18 “hedging activities” for more information on our foreign currency forwardexchange contracts 

the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 6 of our purchases in 2013  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2013  accounted for approximately 43  of our purchases 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development   our development expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software held for sale we spent 529 million 487 million and 471 million for development activities in 2013  2012  and 2011  and of these amounts we capitalized 9 10 and 14 development expenditures are primarily incurred by our technology solutions segment our technology solutions segments product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers we believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our development activities is included in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k

risk factors 

tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

mckesson corporation 

we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from timetotime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property regulatory tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations for example we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 22 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact including legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our managements time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved see financial note 22 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industrys or our pharmaceutical suppliers pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace however in fiscal year 2014 we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to decrease as compared to recent years continued volatility in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded products patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

in recent years pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers 

many healthcare organizations have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computerrelated products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse and the government both state and federal continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements   both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process in addition medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program “schip” extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price to an actual sales volume basis cms has proposed new rules for calculating amp “revised amp” and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost “aac” method under aac reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey 

in addition cms has begun conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national average drug acquisition cost benchmark “nadac” states may use the results of this survey to set pharmacy payment rates cms released the first draft of the pricing data determined through the nadac survey as well as an alternate reimbursement methodology called national average retail price “narp” narp represents the average consumer purchase price of the most commonly dispensed brand and generic drugs states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs 

mckesson corporation 

we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric such as aac or narp would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the federal government may adopt measures that could further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for instance on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which provided for an automatic 2 reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers in january 2013 on january 2 2013 the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which delayed this reduction until march 2013 at which time the president issued an executive order implementing it this automatic reduction is known as “sequestration” additionally concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program or both we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions if any will ultimately be enacted into law or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 

there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

operating security and licensure standards  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration the “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking  there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system “pedigree tracking” certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations nonetheless these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

privacy   state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although we modified our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 new laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate personal or patient information or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

health care reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however given the scope of the changes made and under consideration as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time 

interoperability standards   there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies for example the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government and cms has issued rules defining meaningful use criteria these rules are subject to interpretation by the entities designed to certify such technology and also may be changed or supplemented by the federal government in the future a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting the initial meaningful use criteria and we plan to seek certification for meeting additional meaningful use criteria however we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving rules in addition these new rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these rules are narrowly construed subsequently changed or supplemented or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving rules for applicable products our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems 

fda regulation of medical software the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software computer products and computerassisted products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example effective april 18 2011 the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing computer products once issued may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 

mckesson corporation 

standards for submission of health care claims  hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement the first rule modifies the standards for electronic health care transactions  eg  eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule was extended through june 30 2012 and many healthcare providers have now begun implementing the 5010 rule the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” hhs has postponed the compliance date for icd10 conversion previously october 1 2013 until october 1 2014 updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 when required will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules in addition these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers decisions to purchase our software and systems 

medical billing and coding   medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs similar to the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs for example in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act in recent years to reduce the cost for taxpayers various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the companys operations in canada other provinces are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2013  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs  accounted for approximately 17  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2013  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 44  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  and walmart  were approximately 16  and 10  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment change in our customer mix reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance   

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act and the cost accounting standards we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the companys operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems the malfunction failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including protected health information financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers company and workforce we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers if these systems are interrupted damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party including a cyber attack or fail for any extended period of time it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information the corruption of data or other disruption of business operations similarly denialofservice or other internetbased attacks may range from mere vandalism of electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property although we actively devote significant resources to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information in our possession preventing all cyber incidents is inherently difficult therefore any compromise of our electronic systems including the unauthorized access use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks would adversely affect our reputation our ability to fulfill contractual obligations and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations moreover unauthorized access use or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in a civil criminal or regulatory action including potential fines and penalties any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may also result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segments customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses which include care management programs and our nurse advice services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert managements attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprise‑wide and single entity clinical patient care financial supply chain strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from timetotime third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or technology obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and software systems “systems” that we sell or operate are very complex as with complex systems offered by others our systems may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segments business systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care therefore users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a clients system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages

various risks could interrupt customers access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyber attacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the companys stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in managements estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge

our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries in the future we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments however increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region importexport regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow and if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations it may adversely impact our income tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business since 2011  we have completed approximately 58 billion of business acquisitions integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers including physician affiliates of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

mckesson corporation 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our 135 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2013 historically we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements as needed we anticipate extending or renewing this facility before its expiration although we believe we will be able to renew this facility there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from timetotime we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

financial review continued 

revenues for 2013 approximated 2012 and increased in 2012 compared to 2011 revenues over the last two years benefited from market growth which includes growing drug utilization and price increases in our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97  of our consolidated revenues as well as due to our business acquisitions in addition revenues for 2013 were impacted by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion and the loss of customers 

gross profit and gross profit margin increased over each of the last two years as a percentage of revenues gross profit increased 35  basis points “bp” to 570  in 2013  and 2  bp to 535  in 2012  gross profit margin increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher generics income business acquisitions higher buy margin a 44  million benefit associated with the receipt of our share of settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits brought against drug manufacturers and a lower proportion of revenues attributed to sales to customers warehouses additionally gross profit margin was unfavorably impacted in 2012 by 31 million of product alignment charges these increases in the 2013 gross profit margin were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin 

gross profit margin increased in 2012  compared to 2011 primarily due to business acquisitions higher generics income in our distribution solutions segment and an increase in higher margin revenues in our technology solutions segment these increases were partially offset by a decline in sell margin and by 31 million of product alignment charges additionally gross profit margin in 2011 was impacted by a 51 million benefit associated with the receipt of our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer and a 72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale 

operating expenses increased over each of the last two years operating expenses increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to our acquisitions higher employee compensation and benefit costs a 40 million charge for a legal dispute and a 36 million charge for goodwill impairment these increases were partially offset by an 81 million gain on business combination and lower average wholesale price awp litigation charges operating expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to expenses associated with supporting our higher revenues business acquisitions and higher employee compensation and benefits costs these increases were partially offset by lower awp litigation charges awp litigation charges were 72 million  149 million  and 213 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  

on april 6 2012 we purchased the remaining 50 ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in san francisco california for 90 million which was funded from cash on hand we previously held a 50 ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building this transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition which requires that we remeasure our previously held 50 ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations the remeasurement to fair value resulted in a noncash pretax gain of 81 million 51 million aftertax which was recorded as a gain on business combination within corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013 

other income net was 35 million  21 million  and 36 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  

based on a recent evaluation we committed to a plan to sell our 49 equity interest in nadro sa de cv nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 191 million reducing the investments carrying value to its estimated fair value the charge reflects deterioration in nadros market position projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in mexico 

interest expense decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  and increased in 2012 compared with 2011 interest expense fluctuates based on timing amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new debt issued as well as fees paid on bridge loan facilities used in acquiring businesses 

our reported income tax rates were 303  269  and 309  in 2013  2012  and 2011  fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates and discrete items in 2013  2012  and 2011  income tax expense includes 29 million 66  million and 34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a 31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our awp litigation 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

net income was 1338 million  1403 million  and 1202 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  and diluted earnings per common share were 559  559  and 457  net income for 2011 includes a 72 million aftertax gain 028 per diluted share on the sale of a whollyowned subsidiary mckesson asia pacific pty limited “map” historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material 

diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years in 2013  2012  and 2011  we repurchased 13 million  20 million  and 29 million  of our common shares 

revenues 



revenues for 2013 approximated the prior year and increased 10  to 1227 billion  in 2012  changes in our revenues were primarily impacted by our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97  of our consolidated revenues the increase in revenues in 2012 includes our december 2010 acquisition of us oncology holdings inc us oncology 

direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to market growth which includes growing drug utilization and price increases expanded volume with existing customers and new customers partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions the loss of customers and two less sales days direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to market growth and from our acquisition of us oncology these increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

 sales to customers warehouses for 2013  decreased compared to 2012  primarily due to price deflation associated with brand to generic drugs conversions net of brand price inflation and two less sales days sales to customers warehouses for 2012  increased compared to 2011  primarily due to a new customer and new business with existing customers 

sales to customers warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large selfwarehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers warehouses this distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the company as a standalone service rather it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal selfwarehousing distribution network sales to customers warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the company as one source for both their directtostore business and their warehouse business we generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low costtoserve model on to the customer these sales do however contribute to our gross profit dollars 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the customer mix of revenues from our us pharmaceutical distribution business was as follows 



as previously described a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low costtoserve model when evaluating and pricing customer contracts we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability as a result we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales 

canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues decreased 3  in 2013  compared to 2012  excluding an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 1 revenues decreased primarily due to five less sales days governmentimposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and changes in our customer mix these decreases were partially offset by market growth and an increase in revenues associated with our march 2012 acquisition of the assets of drug trading company limited the independent banner business of the katz group canada inc “katz group” and medicine shoppe canada inc the franchise business of the katz group collectively “katz assets” canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5 in 2012  compared to 2011  excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 2 during 2012 revenues increased primarily due to market growth five additional sales days and a small acquisition in the second quarter of 2011 partially offset by governmentimposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to market growth new customers and our february 22 2013 acquisition of pss world medical inc “pss world medical” these increases were partially offset by five less sales days medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to market growth new customers and five additional sales days 

technology solutions revenues increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to acquisitions higher volume of claims processing and an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers partially offset by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business technology solutions revenues increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to higher revenues for claims processing increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers and a number of small acquisitions made during 2012

distribution solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to increased sales of higher margin generic drugs our business acquisitions an increase in buy margin and a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to sales to customers warehouses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers our distribution solutions segments gross profit margin for 2013 was also favorably affected by the receipt of 44  million representing our share of settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits brought against drug manufacturers 

distribution solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to our acquisition of us oncology and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs partially offset by a decline in sell margin and the receipt of 51 million in 2011 representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer   

our lastin firstout “lifo” net inventory expense was 13 million in 2013  11 million in 2012  and 3 million for 2011  our distribution solutions segment uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the practice in the distribution solutions segments distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses during 2013 and 2012 we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review 

technology solutions segments gross profit margin decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to a change in product and services mix and a 10 million impairment of capitalized software held for sale additionally 2012 gross profit margin includes 31 million of product alignment charges 

technology solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due an increase in higher margin revenues a 72 million asset impairment charge related to our horizon enterprise management tm  “hzerm” software product in 2011 and lower amortization expense related to hzerm these increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of 31 million in 2012 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

during the third quarter of 2012 we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our technology solutions segment as part of this alignment strategy we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle horizon and paragon product lines onto paragons microsoft®based platform additionally we stopped development of our hzerm software product the plan resulted in a pretax charge of 51 million in 2012 of which 31 million was recorded to cost of sales and 20 million was recorded to operating expenses within our technology solutions segment the majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012 the pretax charge included 24 million of noncash asset impairment charges primarily for the writeoff of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward 10 million for severance 7 million for customer allowances and 10 million for other charges 

our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period at the end of the second quarter of 2010 our hzerm software product became generally available in october 2010 we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our hzerm software product and as a result concluded that the estimated future revenues net of estimated related costs were insufficient to recover its carrying value accordingly we recorded a 72 million noncash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our technology solutions segments cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value 

operating expenses   



 operating expenses increased 6  to 47 billion  in 2013  and 6  to 44 billion  in 2012  operating expenses increased in 2013  primarily due to our business acquisitions higher employee compensation and benefit costs a 40 million charge for a legal dispute in our canadian business and a 36 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge these increases were partially offset by an 81 million gain on business combination and lower awp litigation charges operating expenses increased in 2012  primarily due to the addition of us oncology higher employee compensation and benefits costs and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues partially offset by lower awp litigation charges operating expenses include pretax charges of 72 million  149 million  and 213 million  in 2013  2012   and 2011  relating to our awp litigation

the acquisition expenses and related adjustments by segment were as follows

distribution solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to our business acquisitions a 40 million charge for a legal dispute in our canadian business and higher employee compensation and benefits costs these increases were partially offset by lower awp litigation charges additionally this ratio is negatively impacted as a result of decreases in revenue resulting from deflation

pretax charges relating to changes in the companys awp litigation reserve including accrued interest are recorded in the distribution solutions segment the charges for 2013 primarily related to state medicaid claims the charges for 2012 primarily related to the douglas county kansas action settlement and the state and federal medicaid claims the charges for 2011 primarily related to state and federal medicaid claims in view of the number of outstanding cases and expected future claims and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve 

since 2009 the company has cooperated with and responded to an investigation by the regie de lassurance maladie du quebec “ramq” a provincial government agency with administrative authority over the conduct of pharmaceutical businesses in the province of quebec canada the investigation focused on certain discounts and payments offered to pharmacies in quebec as well as payments received by the company from certain manufacturers in the third quarter of 2013 we engaged in settlement discussions to resolve potential legal claims against the company and its customers and suppliers arising from the investigation in consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions in the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a pretax charge of 40 million for estimated probable loss from potential legal claims arising from the investigation the charge was recorded to operating expenses within our distribution solutions segment on april 19 2013 the company entered into a settlement agreement with the ramq to settle all potential claims of the ramq arising from the investigation the agreement provides that the company will pay 40 million to the ramq and provides for a full release of all potential claims by the ramq arising from the investigation

technology solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to our continued investment in research and development activities a 36 million goodwill impairment charge and business acquisitions these increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of 20 million incurred in 2012

financial review continued 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded 46 million of noncash pretax impairment charges in our technology solutions segment these charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product the charge included a 36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value in addition the goodwill had a nominal tax basis this impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations the balance of the charge represents a 10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value we concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs were insufficient to recover its carrying value this impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations 

technology solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to our continued investment in research and development activities a number of small business acquisitions in 2012 and product alignment charges of 20 million these increases were partially offset by cost containment efforts 

corporate expenses decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the gain on business combination and a charitable contribution in 2012 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in a reserve for an environmental liability acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate initiatives corporate expenses for 2012  increased compared to 2011  primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits costs and a charitable contribution 

other income net   



other income net increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an impairment of an asset in 2012 other income net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a receipt in 2011 of 16 million representing the reimbursement of postacquisition interest expense by former shareholders of us oncology which was recorded in corporate and an impairment of an asset in 2012 

impairment of an equity investment   

based on a recent evaluation we committed to a plan to sell our 49  equity interest in nadro sa de cv nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pretax impairment charge of 191 million reducing the investments carrying value to its estimated fair value the charge reflects deterioration in nadros market position projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in mexico cumulative foreign currency translation losses of 69  million were included in the assessment of the investments carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge cumulative foreign currency translation losses net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet the charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our distribution solutions segment the ultimate selling price of our investment in nadro may be different than our current assessment of fair value the fair value of the investment will be reviewed quarterly for any additional impairment

segment operating profit and corporate expenses net 



 operating profit margin for our distribution solutions segment decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to a 191 million impairment charge on an equity investment and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues which includes our business acquisitions these increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin and lower awp litigation charges operating profit margin for our distribution solutions segment increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to higher gross profit margin which included a full year of results from us oncology and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues which included lower awp litigation charges 

operating profit margin in our technology solutions segment decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and a decrease in gross profit margin operating profit margin in our technology solutions segment increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 

corporate expenses net of other income decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the gain on business combination and an increase in other income corporate expenses net of other income increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in other income 

interest expense   interest expense decreased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the repayment of 400 million of longterm debt in february 2012 partially offset by 11 million of bridge loan fees paid in connection with our acquisition of pss world medical interest expense increased in 2012  compared to 2011   primarily due to 17 billion of longterm debt issued in february 2011 in connection with our acquisition of us oncology refer to our discussion under the caption “credit resources” within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities

income taxes our reported income tax rates were 303  269  and 309  in 2013  2012  and 2011  fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates in 2013  2012  and 2011  income tax expense included 29  million 66  million and 34  million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest included in the 2012  discrete tax benefit is a 31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our awp litigation 

we have received tax assessments of 98 million from the us internal revenue service “irs” relating to 2003 through 2006 we disagree with a substantial portion of the tax assessments primarily relating to transfer pricing we are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process we have also received assessments from the canada revenue agency “cra” for a total of 199 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2008 payments of most of the assessments to the cra have been made to stop the accrual of interest we have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the tax court of canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007 and are in the process of filing a notice of objection for 2008 the trial between mckesson canada corporation and the cra argued in the tax court of canada concluded in early february 2012 and we are waiting for the decision we continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements however the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense 

discontinued operation in july 2010 our technology solutions segment sold its whollyowned subsidiary map a provider of phone and webbased healthcare services in australia and new zealand for net sales proceeds of 109 million the divestiture generated a pretax and aftertax gain of 95 million and 72 million as a result of the sale we were able to utilize capital loss carryforwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of 15 million the release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our aftertax gain on the divestiture the aftertax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statement of operations in 2011 the historical financial operating results and net assets of map were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented  

net income   net income was 1338 million  1403 million  and 1202 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  and diluted earnings per common share were 559  559  and 457  net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2013  2012  and 2011  include aftertax awp litigation charges of 45 million  60 million  and 149 million or 019  024  and 057 per diluted common share net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an aftertax gain of 72 million or 028 per diluted share relating to our sale of map

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2013  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51  of our total consolidated revenues sales to our largest customer cvs caremark corporation cvs  accounted for approximately 17  of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2013  trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 44  of total trade accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs  and walmart stores inc walmart  were approximately 16  and 10  of total trade accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2013  are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

at march 31 2013  trade and notes receivables were 8853 million prior to allowances of 121 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  our provision for bad debts was 28 million 30 million and 18 million at march 31 2013  and 2012  the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 14 and 13 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2013 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 9 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories   we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method which approximates average cost rebates cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 103 billion  and 101 billion  at march 31 2013  and 2012  

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 80  and 88  of our inventories at march 31 2013  and 2012  at march 31 2013  and 2012  our lifo reserves net of lcm adjustments were 120 million and 107 million our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized net lifo expense of 13  million 11  million and 3  million within our consolidated statements of operations which related to our nonpharmaceutical products a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 60 million and 76 million higher than market as of march 31 2013  and 2012  as a result we recorded a lcm credit of 16 million and 80  million in 2013  and 2012  within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our lifo inventories to market during 2013 and 2012 we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity in 2014 we expect this trend to continue as a result we may recognize an increase in net lifo expense in 2014 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

goodwill and intangible assets  as a result of acquiring businesses we have 6405 million  and 5032 million  of goodwill at march 31 2013  and 2012  and 2270 million  and 1750 million  of intangible assets net at march 31 2013 and 2012 we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the companys stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit components that have essentially similar operations products services customers and operating margin are aggregated as a single reporting unit management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing 

the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value no further evaluation is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss under the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangibles assets from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for that excess 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate of the reporting units fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge in 2013  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 36 million in our technology solutions segment in 2012  and 2011  we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are generally amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to twenty years we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2013 2012 or 2011 our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2013  and 2012  supplier reserves were 164 million and 115 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2013  and 2012  pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2013  would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 16 million in 2013  the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1247 million  and 1335 million  at march 31 2013  and 2012  and deferred tax liabilities of 3114 million  and 2495 million  deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and other assets we established valuation allowances of 118 million  and 101 million  for 2013  and 2012   against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to federal state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 19 million or 008 per diluted share for 2013 

sharebased compensation our compensation programs include sharebased compensation we account for all sharebased compensation transactions using a fairvalue based measurement method the sharebased compensation expense for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we estimate the grantdate fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes optionspricing model our estimates of employee stock option values rely on assumptions we input into the model the key assumptions involve estimates of future uncertain events the key assumptions influencing the fair value estimates among others are the expected life of the option the expected stock price volatility and the expected dividend yield in determining the expected life of the option we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns we use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor we believe that the combination of both historical and implied volatility provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements once the fair values of employee stock options are determined accounting requirements do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used are different from actual experience 

in addition we develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on sharebased compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate materially differs from the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to revise the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase or decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements we reassess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates 

our assessments of estimated sharebased compensation expense are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact these variables include the volatility of our stock price employee stock option exercise behavior timing number and types of annual sharebased awards the attainment of performance goals and the forfeiture rates as a result future sharebased compensation expense may differ from the companys historical amounts 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuance will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition we may access the longterm debt capital markets from timetotime

operating activities for 2012  reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth 

operating activities for 2011  reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases 

cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors

the companys board has authorized the repurchase of mckessons common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the board authorized the repurchase of the companys common stock as follows 10 billion in april 2010 10 billion in october 2010 10 billion in april 2011 650 million in january 2012 700 million in april 2012 and 500 million in january 2013 total share repurchases transacted through asr programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we retired 18 million shares repurchased for 217 million by the company the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings as such 195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings 

we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 



 cash equivalents which are availableforsale are carried at fair value cash equivalents are primarily invested in aaa rated prime and us government money market funds denominated in us dollars canadian government securities overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by us treasury bonds canadian government securities andor securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the us government and an aaa rated prime money market fund denominated in british pound sterling 

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions deposits at us banks exceed the amount insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation we mitigate the risk of our shortterm investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds 

our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2013  included approximately 15 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax during the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to irs regulations we temporarily borrowed and repaid 10 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the united states the duration of this temporary loan to the united states was less than 60 days

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2013  compared to march 31 2012  primarily due to decrease in cash and cash equivalents balance consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2012  compared to march 31 2011  primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories 

our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2013  compared to march 31 2012  primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents balance our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2012  compared to march 31 2011  primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk   our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2013  interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates should interest rates decline our interest income may be negatively impacted if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2013  interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 million the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

as of march 31 2013  and 2012  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 55 billion and 41 billion the estimated fair value of our longterm debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance our credit ratings changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms 

foreign exchange risk   we record revenues and earnings from canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries israel and mexico which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans as of march 31 2013  a hypothetical adverse 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk

other information about the business

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 6 of our purchases in 2012 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2012 accounted for approximately 45 of our purchases 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

research and development our development expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software held for sale we spent 487 million 471 million and 451 million for development activities in 2012 2011 and 2010 and of these amounts we capitalized 10 14 and 17 development expenditures are primarily incurred by our technology solutions segment our technology solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers we believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our development activities is included in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation our operations are subject to regulations under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 19 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2012 and is not expected to be material in the next year 

employees on march 31 2012 we employed approximately 37700 persons compared to 36400 and 32500 on march 31 2011 and 2010 

financial information about foreign and domestic operations information as to foreign and domestic operations is included in financial notes 1 and 22 “significant accounting policies” and “segments of business” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii of this report and the “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended some of these statements can be identified by use of forwardlooking words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “may” “will” “should” “seeks” “approximately” “intends” “plans” or “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology the discussion of financial trends strategy plans or intentions may also include forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected anticipated or implied although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed in item 1a of part i of this report under “risk factors” the reader should not consider the list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 

these and other risks and uncertainties are described herein and in other information contained in our publicly available sec filings and press releases readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date such statements were first made except to the extent required by federal securities laws we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from timetotime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property regulatory tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations for example we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 19 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact including legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved see financial note 19 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase next year as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace changes in the availability pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs or changes in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source contract manufacture and distribute such generic products the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

in recent years pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers 

many healthcare organizations also have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode our customer and revenue base 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computerrelated products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations 

healthcare fraud we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud waste and abuse and the government both state and federal continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud waste and abuse affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to and knowing retention of an overpayment by a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could become liable for damages suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

reimbursements both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process in addition medicare medicaid and the state children’s health insurance program “schip” extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price to an actual sales volume basis cms has proposed new rules for calculating amp “revised amp” and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost “aac” method under aac reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric such as aac would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that these changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

operating security and licensure standards we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration the “dea” the u s food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product development manufacture distribution and sale as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

pedigree tracking there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system “pedigree tracking” certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 

in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations nonetheless these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

privacy state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although we modified our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 new laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate personal or patient information or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation

health care reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers although the us supreme court is considering whether to strike down some or all of the act’s provisions further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however given the scope of the changes made and under consideration as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time 

interoperability standards there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies for example the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government effective september 27 2010 cms issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria under the staged approach cms has issued rules that identify the initial criteria for meaningful use and is updating these initial criteria with additional rules in addition these standards are subject to interpretation by the entities designed to certify such technology a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting the initial criteria however we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards in addition these new standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems 

fda regulation of medical software  the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software computer products and computerassisted products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example effective april 18 2011 the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution additionally beginning in calendar 2013 the affordable care act provides that a tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices will have to be paid by each medical device manufacturer since we sell medical devices we may be impacted by this tax any additional fda regulations governing computer products once issued may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 

standards for submission of health care claims  hhs has adopted two new rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement the first rule modifies the standards for electronic health care transactions  eg  eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule has been extended through june 30 2012 the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” hhs has postponed the compliance date for icd10 conversion previously october 1 2013 for an unspecified period updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 when required will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new standards in addition these standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems

medical billing and coding medical billing coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs similar to the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs for example in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act in recent years to reduce the cost for taxpayers various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2012 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs and rite aid accounted for approximately 16 and 10 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2012 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 49 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs walmart and rite aid were approximately 17 10 and 9 of total accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment change in our customer mix reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government with certain exceptions we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act and the cost accounting standards we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems the implementation delay malfunction or failure of these systems for any extended period of time or breach of these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers if these systems are interrupted damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party such as a cyber attack or fail for any extended period of time we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses which include care management programs and our nurse advice services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprisewide clinical patient care financial supply chain strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from timetotime third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or technology obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and software systems “systems” that we sell or operate are very complex as with complex systems offered by others our systems may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 cyber attacks computer viruses hacking and other similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change controls information security procedures and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security but our precautions may not protect against all risks if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care if customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations based in and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical products in a number of foreign countries in the future we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments however increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region importexport regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements physical limitations or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation for example if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo lastin firstout method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes it would adversely impact our cash flow and if legislation is passed to change the current us taxation treatment of income from foreign operations it may adversely impact our income tax expense the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business since 2010 we have completed approximately 34 billion of business acquisitions integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers including physician affiliates of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

  

mckesson corporation 

  

our 135 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2012 historically we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements as needed we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration although we believe we will be able to renew this facility there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from timetotime we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

our reported income tax rates were 269 309 and 322 in 2012 2011 and 2010 fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates in addition in 2012 2011 and 2010 income tax expense includes 66 million 34 million and 7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a 31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our awp litigation

revenues 

 

 revenues increased 10 to 1227 billion in 2012 and 3 to 1121 billion in 2011 the increase in revenues in each year primarily reflects market growth in our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97 of our consolidated revenues and our acquisition of us oncology 

direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth which includes growing drug utilization and price increases and from our acquisition of us oncology these increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth the effect of a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011 and due to our acquisition of us oncology these increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

sales to customers’ warehouses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to a new customer and new business with existing customers sales to customers’ warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large selfwarehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers’ warehouses this distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the company as a standalone service rather it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal selfwarehousing distribution network sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the company as one source for both their directtostore business and their warehouse business we generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low costtoserve model on to the customer these sales do however contribute to our gross profit dollars

the customer mix of revenues from our us pharmaceutical distribution business was as follows 

 

 as previously described a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low costtoserve model when evaluating and pricing customer contracts we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability as a result we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales 

canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5 in 2012 compared to 2011 excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 2 during 2012 revenues increased primarily due to market growth five additional sales days and a small acquisition in the second quarter of 2011 partially offset by governmentimposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8 in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 7 during 2011 revenues increased 1 in 2011 canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth offset by a governmentimposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth new customers and five additional sales days medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth partially offset by a decrease in demand associated with the flu season 

technology solutions revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher revenues for claims processing increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers and a number of small acquisitions made during 2012 technology solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and higher revenues for claims processing partially offset by the sale of map in july 2010

distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of us oncology and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs partially offset by a decline in sell margin and the receipt of 51 million in 2011 representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer 

distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher buy margin increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of us oncology partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin our distribution solutions segment’s 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by the receipt of 51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our lastin firstout “lifo” net inventory expense was 11 million in 2012 3 million in 2011 and 8 million for 2010 our distribution solutions segment uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the practice in the distribution solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years during 2012 we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review 

technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in higher margin revenues a 72 million asset impairment charge related to our horizon enterprise management tm “hzerm” software product in 2011 and lower amortization expense related to hzerm these increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of 31 million in 2012 

technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a 72 million asset impairment charge related to hzerm the sale of map and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue 

during the third quarter of 2012 we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our technology solutions segment as part of this alignment strategy we will be converging our core clinical and revenue cycle horizon and paragon product lines onto paragon’s microsoft ® –based platform over time additionally we have stopped development of our hzerm software product the plan resulted in a pretax charge of 51 million in 2012 of which 31 million was recorded to cost of sales and 20 million was recorded to operating expenses within our technology solutions segment the majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012 the pretax charge includes 24 million of noncash asset impairment charges primarily for the writeoff of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward 10 million for severance 7 million for customer allowances and 10 million for other charges

our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period at the end of the second quarter of 2010 our hzerm software product became generally available in october 2010 we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our hzerm software product and as a result concluded that the estimated future revenues net of estimated related costs were insufficient to recover its carrying value accordingly we recorded a 72 million noncash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our technology solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value 

operating expenses 

 

  

 operating expenses increased 6 to 44 billion in 2012 and 13 to 41 billion in 2011 operating expenses include pretax charges of 149 million and 213 million in 2012 and 2011 relating to our awp litigation and a pretax credit of 20 million in 2010 relating to our securities litigation matter operating expenses increased in 2012 primarily due to the addition of us oncology higher employee compensation and benefits costs and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues partially offset by a lower awp litigation charge operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to the awp litigation charge higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including our profit sharing investment plan “psip” and the acquisition of us oncology 

the mckesson corporation psip was a member of the settlement class in the consolidated securities litigation action on april 27 2009 the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds on october 9 2009 the psip received approximately 119 million of the consolidated securities litigation action proceeds approximately 42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of mckesson common stock owned by the psip participants during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010 approximately 77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares the “unallocated proceeds” of mckesson common stock owned by the psip in an employee stock ownership plan “esop” suspense account in accordance with the plan terms the psip distributed all of the unallocated proceeds to current psip participants after the close of the plan year in april 2010 the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip was reimbursement for the loss in value of the company’s common stock held by the psip in its esop suspense account during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and was not a contribution made by the company to the psip or esop accordingly there were no accounting consequences to the company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip 

as a result of the psip’s receipt of the unallocated proceeds in 2010 the company contributed 1 million to the psip accordingly psip expense for 2010 was nominal commencing in 2011 the company resumed its contributions to the psip

interest expense interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 17 billion of longterm debt issued in february 2011 in connection with our acquisition of us oncology interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to 25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of us oncology interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011 these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of 215 million of our longterm debt in march 2010 refer to our discussion under the caption “credit resources” within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities 

income taxes our reported income tax rates were 269 309 and 322 in 2012 2011 and 2010 fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates in addition in 2012 2011 and 2010 income tax expense included 66 million 34 million and 7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a 31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our awp litigation

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2012 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and rite aid corporation “rite aid” accounted for approximately 16 and 10 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2012 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 49 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs walmart stores inc “walmart” and rite aid were approximately 17 10 and 9 of total accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2012 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

at march 31 2012 trade and notes receivables were 8735 million prior to allowances of 111 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 our provision for bad debts was 30 million 18 million and 17 million at march 31 2012 and 2011 the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 13 and 15 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2012 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 9 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k

inventories we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method and the cost of canadian inventories is determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method which approximates average cost rebates fees cash discounts allowances chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 101 billion and 92 billion at march 31 2012 and 2011 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 88 and 87 of our inventories at march 31 2012 and 2011 at march 31 2012 and 2011 our lifo reserves net of lcm adjustments were 107 million and 96 million lifo reserves include both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized net lifo expense of 11 million 3 million and 8 million within our consolidated statements of operations which related to our nonpharmaceutical products a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the average cost or fifo inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory  ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 76 million and 156 million higher than market as of march 31 2012 and 2011 as a result we recorded a lcm credit of 80 million in 2012 and a lcm charge of 44 million in 2011 within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our lifo inventories to market during 2012 we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions

goodwill as a result of acquiring businesses we have 5032 million and 4364 million of goodwill at march 31 2012 and 2011 we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component – one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit components that have essentially similar operations products services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing 

impairment tests require that we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform a quantitative assessment the fair values can be determined using the market income or cost approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time the judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

supplier incentives fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold we consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory

supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2012 and 2011 supplier reserves were 115 million and 102 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2012 and 2011 pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2012 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 16 million in 2012 the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1335 million and 1297 million at march 31 2012 and 2011 and deferred tax liabilities of 2495 million and 2261 million deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and other assets we established valuation allowances of 101 million and 99 million for 2012 and 2011 against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to federal state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 19 million or 008 per diluted share for 2012 

sharebased compensation our compensation programs include sharebased compensation we account for all sharebased compensation transactions using a fairvalue based measurement method the sharebased compensation expense for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions for awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis for awards with performance conditions and a single vest date we recognize the expense on a straightline basis 

we estimate the grantdate fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes optionspricing model our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events the key factors influencing the estimation process among others are the expected life of the option the expected stock price volatility and the expected dividend yield in determining the expected life of the option we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns we use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor we believe that this marketbased input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations once the fair values of employee stock options are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used are different from actual experience 

  

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

  

in addition we develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on sharebased compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate materially differs from the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to revise the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase or decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements we reassess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates 

our assessments of estimated sharebased compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact these variables include the volatility of our stock price employee stock option exercise behavior timing number and types of annual sharebased awards and the attainment of performance goals as a result the future sharebased compensation expense may differ from the company’s historical amounts 

loss contingencies we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and shortterm borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition from timetotime we may access the longterm debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities 

net cash flow from operating activities was 2950 million in 2012 compared to 2338 million in 2011 and 2316 million in 2010 operating activities for 2012 reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth 

operating activities for 2011 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases 

operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the awp litigation private payer settlement payments of 350 million

cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors 

net cash used in investing activities was 1502 million in 2012 compared to 624 million in 2011 and 309 million in 2010 investing activities for 2012 included 1156 million of cash payments for acquisitions including 919 million for our acquisition of the katz assets investing activities in 2012 also included 225 million and 178 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software 

investing activities for 2011 included 292 million of cash payments for acquisitions including 244 million for our acquisition of us oncology and 109 million of cash received from the sale of map investing activities in 2011 also included 233 million and 155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software investing activities for 2010 included 199 million and 179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of 55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the awp private litigation settlement payments 

financing activities utilized cash of 1905 million in 2012 compared to 1841 million in 2011 and 421 million in 2010 financing activities for 2012 included 1850 million of cash paid for share repurchases 400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 775 notes in february 2012 195 million of dividends paid 400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and 167 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options 

financing activities for 2011 reflect 1689 million of cash received from the issuance of longterm debt in february 2011 we issued 600 million of 325 notes due 2016 600 million of 475 notes due 2021 and 500 million of 600 notes due 2041 net proceeds from the issuance of the longterm notes after discounts and offering expenses were used to pay off the 1730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of us oncology also as part of our acquisition of us oncology we borrowed 1000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by february 2011 financing activities for 2011 also included 2050 million of cash paid for share repurchases 171 million of cash paid for dividends and 367 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options 

financing activities for 2010 included 323 million of cash paid for share repurchases and 218 million of cash paid on our longterm debt which primarily consisted of 215 million paid on the maturity of our 913 series c senior notes in march 2010 131 million of cash paid for dividends and 212 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions 

the board authorized the repurchase of the company’s common stock as follows 10 billion in april 2010 10 billion in october 2010 10 billion in april 2011 and 650 million in january 2012 

total share repurchases transacted through asr programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows 

 

  

   

mckesson corporation

in 2012 and 2011 the majority of our share repurchases were transacted through a number of asr programs with third party financial institutions as follows 10 billion in may 2010 275 million in march 2011 650 million in may 2011 and 12 billion in march 2012 in 2010 all of our share repurchases were conducted through open market transactions all programs were funded with cash on hand 

in march 2012 we entered into an asr program with a third party financial institution to repurchase 12 billion of the company’s common stock as of march 31 2012 we had received 12 million shares representing the minimum number of shares due under this program and the average price paid per share of 8719 was based on the average daily volumeweighted average price of our common stock less a discount calculated as of march 31 2012 the total number of shares to be ultimately repurchased by us and the final settlement price per share will be determined at the completion of this program based on the average daily volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the program less a discount this program is anticipated to be completed no later than the second quarter of 2013 

in april 2012 the board authorized the repurchase of an additional 700 million of the company’s common stock bringing the total authorization outstanding to 10 billion 

although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

   our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2012 included approximately 14 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our primary intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax during the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to irs regulations we temporarily borrowed and repaid 10 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the united states the duration of this temporary loan to the united states was less than 60 days 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2012 compared to march 31 2011 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2011 compared to march 31 2010 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables other accrued liabilities and the current portion of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in receivables 

our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2012 compared to march 31 2011 primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31 2011 compared to march 31 2010 primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the us oncology acquisition 

in may 2010 the quarterly dividend was raised from 012 to 018 per common share and in april 2011 the quarterly dividend was raised from 018 to 020 per common share the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2012 2011 and 2010 we paid total cash dividends of 195 million 171 million and 131 million 

contractual obligations 

the table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at march 31 2012 

 

  

      at march 31 2012 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 504 million since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table 

in addition at march 31 2012 our banks and insurance companies have issued 86 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2012 interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates should interest rates decline our interest income may be negatively impacted if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2012 interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately 18 million the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

as of march 31 2012 and 2011 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 41 billion and 43 billion the estimated fair value of our longterm debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance our credit ratings changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms 

foreign exchange risk we derive revenues and earnings from canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries israel and mexico which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans as of march 31 2012 a hypothetical adverse 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii of this report and the “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended some of these statements can be identified by use of forwardlooking words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “may” “will” “should” “seeks” “approximately” “intends” “plans” or “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology the discussion of financial trends strategy plans or intentions may also include forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected anticipated or implied although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed in item 1a of part i of this report under “risk factors” the reader should not consider the list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 

these and other risks and uncertainties are described herein and in other information contained in our publicly available sec filings and press releases readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date such statements were first made except to the extent required by federal securities laws we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from timetotime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property regulatory tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations for example we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 17 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact including class actions and other legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved see financial note 17 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

mckesson corporation 

changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes have included increased use of managed care cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition branded price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition we also distribute generic pharmaceuticals which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings an increase or a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source and distribute such generic products launched “at risk” the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us 

in recent years the pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers 

many healthcare organizations also have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems which in turn may erode our customer and revenue base 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computerrelated products and services could impose increased costs negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers delay the introduction or implementation of our new products or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations

  healthcare fraud we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers as well as our provision of products and services to government entities subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  reimbursements both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical treatments and related services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” signed into law in 2010 revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price “amp” using a smoothing process in addition medicare medicaid and the state children’s health insurance program “schip” extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price “asp” to an actual sales volume basis we expect that the use of an amp benchmark and the revised asp calculations would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that these changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  operating security and licensure standards we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration the “dea” the food and drug administration “fda” various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services “hhs” the cms and other comparable agencies certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea fda hhs cms various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale as part of these operating security and licensure standards we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  pedigree tracking there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government agencies including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system “pedigree tracking” certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 

mckesson corporation 

final regulations under the federal prescription drug marketing act requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances became effective december 1 2006 this latter regulation has been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors a preliminary injunction was issued by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of this regulation this injunction was affirmed by the court of appeals for the second circuit in july 2008 in december 2008 both parties agreed to delay this litigation pending the outcome of certain us congressional legislative initiatives in addition the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 “fdaa” which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations nonetheless these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  privacy state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information how that information may be used and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although our policies procedures and systems are being updated and modified to comply with the current requirements of applicable state and foreign laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act “arra” of 2009 evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations furthermore failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

  health care reform  the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely while we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act will have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations given the scope of the changes made and the uncertainties associated with the its implementation we cannot predict its full impact on the company at this time 

  interoperability standards there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies for example the hitech act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government effective september 27 2010 cms issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria in “stage 1” cms defined the initial criteria for meaningful use and has stated that it intends to update these initial criteria with additional “stage 2” criteria by the end of calendar 2011 and with additional “stage 3” criteria by the end of calendar 2013 we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards in addition these new standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems 

mckesson corporation 

  fda regulation of computer products  the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computerassisted products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act for example effective april 18 2011 the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any additional fda regulations governing computer products once issued may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 

  standards for submission of health care claims  hhs has adopted two new rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement in the first rule effective january 1 2012 hhs has modified the standards for electronic health care transactions  eg  eligibility claims submission and payment and electronic remittance from version 40104010a to version 5010 in the second rule effective october 1 2013 hhs has updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases ninth revision “icd9” to international classification of diseases tenth revision “icd10” updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd10 code set generally claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd10 when required will not be processed and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new standards in addition these standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems 

  claims transmissions medical billing and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws that pertain to companies that provide billing and collection services or that provide consulting services in connection with billing and collection activities in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs similar to the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs for example in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act in recent years to reduce the cost for taxpayers various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and in some provinces the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company’s operations in canada other provinces are considering similar changes which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees individually or in combination such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution thirdparty logistics companies and large payer organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payers care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2011 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs and rite aid accounted for approximately 14 and 11 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2011 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs walmart and rite aid were approximately 13 10 and 9 of total accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers as well as with government entities and agencies a material default in payment change in our customer mix reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

in addition since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act and the cost accounting standards we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate these rules or regulations fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and we will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems the implementation delay malfunction or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers if these systems are interrupted damaged by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party or fail for any extended period of time we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payer businesses which include disease management programs and our nurse triage services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages additionally we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract such as a claim directly by a patient we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprisewide clinical patient care financial supply chain strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payers challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete 

the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are equivalent or superior to our technology in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from timetotime third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing products or technology obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing technology additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and software systems “systems” that we sell or operate are very complex as with complex systems offered by others our systems may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 computer viruses hacking and similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change control and system security measures but our precautions may not protect against all problems if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

mckesson corporation 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations based in foreign countries including canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries and israel and we have a large investment in mexico in the future we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments however increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region importexport regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business since 2008 we have completed approximately 3 billion of business acquisitions integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers including physician affiliates of the combined businesses further acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired as well as costs related to potential impairment charges assumed litigation and unknown liabilities in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our 135 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2011 although we did not use this facility in 2010 or 2011 we have historically used it to fund working capital requirements as needed we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration although we believe we will be able to renew this facility there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 

mckesson corporation 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from timetotime we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

  overview

  revenues 

 

revenues increased 3 to 1121 billion in 2011 and 2 to 1087 billion in 2010 the increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97 of our consolidated revenues 

direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers the effect of a shift from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011 and due to our acquisition of us oncology these increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth partially offset by greater sales of lower priced generic drugs and the loss of several customers in late 2009 revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand associated with the flu season 

sales to customers’ warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of brand to generic conversions sales to customers’ warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid2009 partially offset by expanded business with existing customers 

sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large selfwarehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers’ warehouses this distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the company as a standalone service rather it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal selfwarehousing distribution network sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the company as one source for both their directtostore business and their warehouse business we generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low costtoserve model on to the customer these sales do however contribute to our gross profit dollars 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the customer mix of our us pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows 

 

as previously described a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low costtoserve model when evaluating and pricing customer contracts we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability as a result we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales 

canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 7 on a constant currency basis revenues increased 1 in 2011 canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth offset by a governmentimposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and brand to generic conversions canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to market growth and a favorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 3 on a constant currency basis revenues increased by 7 in 2010 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth partially offset by the decrease in demand associated with the flu season medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers 

technology solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and growth in our outsourcing services partially offset by the sale of map in july 2010 technology solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher services revenues associated with increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base these increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher software revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales

  gross profit 

 

 

 gross profit increased 5 to 60 billion in 2011 and 6 to 57 billion in 2010 as a percentage of revenues gross profit increased by 11 bp in 2011 and 18 bp in 2010 gross profit margin increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our distribution solutions segment and increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments 

in 2011 our distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher buy margin increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of us oncology partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers our distribution solutions segment’s 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a credit of 51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit 

in 2010 our distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flurelated demand across our distribution businesses gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs these benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin 

our lastin firstout “lifo” net inventory expense was 3 million in 2011 and 8 million for 2010 and 2009 our distribution solutions segment uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the practice in the distribution solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

in 2011 our technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased compared to 2010 primarily due to a 72 million asset impairment charge the sale of map and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products these decreases were partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue in 2010 our technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to a favorable change in revenue mix partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate 

our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period in october 2010 we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our horizon enterprise revenue management tm “hzerm” software product and as a result concluded that the estimated future revenues net of estimated related costs were insufficient to recover its carrying value accordingly we recorded a 72 million noncash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our technology solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value 

  operating expenses 

 

 

 operating expenses increased 13 to 41 billion in 2011 and decreased 12 to 37 billion in 2010 excluding the 2011 2010 and 2009 litigation charges credit of 213 million 20 million and 493 million operating expenses increased 7 in 2011 and remained flat in 2010 excluding the litigation charges credit operating expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including the mckesson corporation profit sharing investment plan “psip” and the addition of us oncology 

excluding the litigation charges credit operating expenses for 2010 approximated 2009 primarily due to lower psip expense cost containment efforts and the sale of two businesses during 2009 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives 

the mckesson corporation psip was a member of the settlement class in the consolidated securities litigation action on april 27 2009 the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds on october 9 2009 the psip received approximately 119 million of the consolidated securities litigation action proceeds approximately 42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of mckesson common stock owned by the psip participants during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010 approximately 77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares the “unallocated proceeds” of mckesson common stock owned by the psip in an employee stock ownership plan “esop” suspense account in accordance with the plan terms the psip distributed all of the unallocated proceeds to current psip participants after the close of the plan year in april 2010 the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip was reimbursement for the loss in value of the company’s common stock held by the psip in its esop suspense account during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and was not a contribution made by the company to the psip or esop 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

accordingly there were no accounting consequences to the company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip 

as a result of the psip’s receipt of the unallocated proceeds in 2010 the company contributed 1 million to the psip accordingly psip expense for 2010 was nominal in 2011 the company resumed its contributions to the psip 

psip expense by segment for the last three years was as follows 

 

 on a segment basis distribution solutions segment’s operating expenses increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 primarily due to the awp litigation charges of 213 million and 493 million in 2011 and 2009 excluding the awp charge operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including psip expenses and the addition of us oncology operating expenses in 2011 also increased as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

excluding the awp charge distribution solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during 2009 lower psip expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment these decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions 

as previously reported in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to first databank inc’s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for 350 million we also recorded an accrual of 143 million for pending and expected awp claims by public payers the combination of the settlement for all awp private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected awp claims by public payers resulted in a pretax noncash charge of 493 million in the third quarter of 2009 in the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a pretax charge of 24 million for the settlement with the state of connecticut relating to awp claims the settlement included an express denial of liability and a release by connecticut of the company as to all matters alleged or which could have been alleged in the action a cash payment of 26 million was made in the third quarter of 2011 for this settlement during the third quarter of 2011 following a review of the reserve for estimated probable losses from current and possible future public entity awp claims which review included consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions during and after the third quarter relating to state and federal medicaid claims we recorded a pretax charge of 189 million all awp litigation charges were included in our distribution solutions segment’s operating expenses as of march 31 2011 the reserve relating to awp public entity claims was 330 million and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet refer to financial note 17 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for further information

we anticipate incurring additional acquisitionrelated expenses in 2012 as we continue to integrate us oncology 

technology solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 the growth in 2011 reflects our increased investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit costs which includes psip expense partially offset by the sale of map in the second quarter of 2011 operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower psip expense cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009 partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities 

corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property partially offset by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility as a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on april 1 2010 fees associated with our accounts receivable sales facility are now recorded in interest expense prior to 2011 these fees were recorded in corporate administrative expenses corporate expenses for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs other business initiatives and legal settlement charges 

in 2010 we recorded net credits of 20 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation which were recorded in corporate expenses

in 2010 other income net included a 17 million pretax gain 14 million aftertax from the sale of our 50 equity interest in mckesson logistic solutions llc “mls” the gain on sale of our investment in mls was recorded within our distribution solutions segment this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

in 2009 other income net included a pretax impairment charge of 63 million 60 million aftertax on two equityheld investments as further described below and a pretax gain of 24 million 14 million aftertax from the sale of our 42 equity interest in verispan llc “verispan” the impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in verispan were both recorded within our distribution solutions segment 

we evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value in 2009 we determined that the fair value of our interest in parata systems llc “parata” was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was otherthantemporary fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates we determined the impairment was otherthantemporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and weak market conditions as a result we recorded a pretax impairment of 58 million 55 million aftertax on this investment which is recorded as other income net in the consolidated statements of operations within our distribution solutions segment our investment in parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 

in 2009 we also recorded a pretax impairment of 5 million 5 million aftertax on another equityheld investment within our distribution solutions segment 

  segment operating profit and corporate expenses

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

corporate expenses net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses which were fully offset by an increase in other income including the 16 million benefit associated with the reimbursement of postacquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of us oncology corporate expenses net of other income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income 

  interest expense interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to 25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of us oncology interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011 these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of 215 million of our longterm debt in march 2010 interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to our issuance of 700 million of longterm debt in february 2009 refer to our discussion under the caption “credit resources” within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities 

  income taxes our reported tax rates were 309 322 and 227 in 2011 2010 and 2009 in addition to the items noted below fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates 

in 2011 income tax expense included 34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest 

in 2009 income tax expense included 111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which 87 million represents a noncash benefit these benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest the recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations 

the us internal revenue service “irs” is currently examining our fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and we anticipate the field work will be completed and they will issue the revenue agent report in our first quarter of fiscal 2012 we have received assessments from the canada revenue agency “cra” for a total of 169 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007 payments of most of the assessments to the cra have been made to stop the accrual of interest we have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the tax court of canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007 if we are not successful in resolving these issues with the cra a trial date has been set for october 17 2011 with the tax court of canada we believe that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to the irs and cra examinations however the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense 

  discontinued operation in july 2010 our technology solutions segment sold map a provider of phone and webbased healthcare services in australia and new zealand for net sales proceeds of 109 million the divestiture generated a pretax and aftertax gain of 95 million and 72 million as a result of the sale we were able to utilize capital loss carryforwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of 15 million the release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our aftertax gain on the divestiture the aftertax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations in 2011 the historical financial operating results and net assets of map were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

  allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt during 2011 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and rite aid corporation “rite aid” accounted for approximately 14 and 11 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2011 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs walmart stores inc “walmart” and rite aid were approximately 13 10 and 9 of total accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2011 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed at this time we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 

at march 31 2011 trade and notes receivables were 8108 million prior to allowances of 124 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 our provision for bad debts was 18 million 17 million and 29 million at march 31 2011 and 2010 the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 15 and 18 an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 01 in the 2011 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately 8 million the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k

  inventories we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method and the cost of canadian inventories is determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method rebates fees cash discounts allowances chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 92 billion and 94 billion at march 31 2011 and 2010 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 87 of our inventories at march 31 2011 and 2010 at march 31 2011 and 2010 our lifo reserves net of lcm adjustments were 96 million and 93 million lifo reserves include both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized net lifo expense of 3 million 8 million and 8 million within our consolidated statements of operations in 2011 our 3 million net lifo expense related to our nonpharmaceutical products a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the fifo inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or inventory as valued under fifo primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 156 million and 112 million higher than fifo as of march 31 2011 and 2010 as a result in 2011 and 2010 we recorded lcm charges of 44 million and 5 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our lifo inventories to market as deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues we anticipate that lifo credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by lcm reserves 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory if indicated as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results 

  business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill effective april 1 2009 acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred acquisitionrelated expenses totaled 52 million in 2011 and were not material in 2010 

several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions

  goodwill as a result of acquiring businesses we have 4364 million and 3568 million of goodwill at march 31 2011 and 2010 we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit components that have essentially similar operations products services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing 

impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units if the carrying value exceeds the fair value a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations fair values can be determined using the market income or cost approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time the judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

  supplier incentives fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold we consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory

  supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2011 and 2010 supplier reserves were 102 million and 89 million the ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2011 and 2010 pertain to our distribution solutions segment an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 01 of trade payables at march 31 2011 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 14 million in 2011 the selected 01 hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

  income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1297 million and 1187 million at march 31 2011 and 2010 and deferred tax liabilities of 2261 million and 1845 million deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and other assets we established valuation allowances of 99 million against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to federal state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 16 million or 006 per diluted share for 2011 

  sharebased compensation our compensation programs include sharebased compensation we account for all sharebased compensation transactions using a fairvalue based measurement method the sharebased compensation expense is recognized for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions for awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis for awards with performance conditions and a single vest date we recognize the expense on a straightline basis 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we estimate the grantdate fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes optionspricing model we believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events the key factors influencing the estimation process among others are the expected life of the option the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield in determining the expected life of the option we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns we use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor we believe that this marketbased input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations once the fair values of employee stock options are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used are different from actual experience 

in addition we develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on sharebased compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements we reassess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates 

our assessments of estimated sharebased compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact these variables include the volatility of our stock price employee stock option exercise behavior timing number and types of annual sharebased awards and the attainment of performance goals as a result the future sharebased compensation expense may differ from the company’s historical amounts 

  loss contingencies we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure of the proceeding is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and shortterm borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition from timetotime we may access the longterm debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities

net cash flow from operating activities was 2338 million in 2011 compared to 2316 million in 2010 and 1351 million in 2009 operating activities for 2011 included a noncash charge of 213 million and the related income tax benefit of 64 million for the awp litigation charge operating activities for 2011 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases cash flows from operations can also be significantly affected by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors 

operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the awp litigation private payer settlement payments of 350 million 

operating activities for 2009 included a noncash charge of 493 million and the related income tax benefit of 182 million for the awp litigation charge operating activities for 2009 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory inventory net of drafts and accounts payable

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions as of march 31 2011 500 million remained available for future repurchases under the october 2010 board approved share repurchase plan in april 2011 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10 billion of the company’s common stock

in july 2008 the board authorized the retirement of shares of the company’s common stock that may be repurchased from timetotime pursuant to its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2009 all of the 4 million repurchased shares which we purchased for 204 million were formally retired by the company the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings as such 165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings 

the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

  selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

 

 our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2011 included approximately 18 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax during the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to irs regulations we temporarily borrowed and repaid 10 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the united states the duration of this temporary loan to the united states was less than 60 days 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements 

consolidated working capital decreased at march 31 2011 compared to march 31 2010 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables accrued liabilities and the current portion of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in receivables consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2010 compared to march 31 2009 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of 215 million of our longterm debt in march 2010

  debt covenant 

our various borrowing facilities and longterm debt are subject to certain covenants our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility which cannot exceed 565 if we exceed this ratio repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated as of march 31 2011 this ratio was 357 and we were in compliance with our other financial covenants a reduction in our credit ratings or the lack of compliance with our covenants could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  interest rate risk our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2011 interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates should interest rates decline our interest income may be negatively impacted if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2011 interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately 17 million the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 

as of march 31 2011 and 2010 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 43 billion and 25 billion the estimated fair value of our longterm debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance our credit ratings changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms 

  foreign exchange risk we derive revenues and earnings from canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries israel and mexico which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans as of march 31 2011 a hypothetical adverse 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk

  customers during 2010 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs caremark corporation “cvs” and rite aid corporation “rite aid” accounted for approximately 15 and 12 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2010 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 45 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs and rite aid were approximately 14 and 10 of total accounts receivable substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our distribution solutions segment 

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 8 of our purchases in 2010 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2010 accounted for approximately 46 of our purchases 

a significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases in addition we have certain distribution arrangements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin 

  research and development our development expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software held for sale we spent 451 million 438 million and 420 million for development activities in 2010 2009 and 2008 and of these amounts we capitalized 17 for each of the last three years development expenditures are primarily incurred by our technology solutions segment our technology solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers we believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our development activities is included in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

  environmental regulation our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program 

we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 18 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs environmental costs and accruals including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations are presently not material to our operations or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2010 and is not expected to be material in the next year

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii of this report and the “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended some of these statements can be identified by use of forwardlooking words such as “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “may” “will” “should” “seeks” “approximately” “intends” “plans” or “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology the discussion of financial trends strategy plans or intentions may also include forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected anticipated or implied although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed in item 1a of part i of this report under “risk factors” the reader should not consider the list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 

these and other risks and uncertainties are described herein and in other information contained in our publicly available sec filings and press releases readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date such statements were first made except to the extent required by federal securities laws we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations liquidity and cash flows although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties they may include but are not limited to the factors discussed below our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

from timetotime and in the ordinary course of our business we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust commercial employment environmental intellectual property regulatory tort and other various claims all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages future court decisions and legislative activity may increase the company’s exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations in some cases substantial noneconomic remedies or punitive damages may be sought for some complaints filed against the company we are currently unable to estimate the remaining amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company 

mckesson corporation 

the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously nevertheless it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations for example we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 18 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements which could have such an impact including class actions and other legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods 

litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to normal business operations the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations which could also harm our business even if these matters are not resolved against us the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved see financial note 18 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes include increased use of managed care cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels consolidation of pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups 

we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these changes such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 

changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or changes in our customer mix could also significantly reduce our revenues and net income due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services 

the majority of our us pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide however failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  generic pharmaceuticals healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents in recent years our financial results have improved from our generic drug offering programs an increase or a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing or reimbursement of these generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products during the pendency of these legal challenges a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent to the extent we source and distribute such generic products launched “at risk” the brandname company could assert infringement claims against us while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us

  international sourcing we may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries including but not limited to 1 difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities 2 inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand 3 other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply and 4 damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues manufacturing difficulties could result in manufacturing shutdowns product shortages and delays in product manufacturing 

  pedigree tracking there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government agencies including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system “pedigree tracking” certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 final regulations under the federal prescription drug marketing act requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances became effective december 1 2006 this latter regulation has been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors a preliminary injunction was issued by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of this regulation this injunction was affirmed by the court of appeals for the second circuit in july 2008 in december 2008 both parties agreed to delay this litigation pending the outcome of certain us congressional legislative initiatives in addition the us food and drug administration “fda” amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies on march 26 2010 the fda released the serialized numerical identifier “sni” guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations nonetheless these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  healthcare fraud we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs furthermore our relationships with pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things 1 prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs 2 impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and 3 prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

mckesson corporation 

  claims transmissions medical billing and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws that pertain to companies that provide billing and collection services or that provide consulting services in connection with billing and collection activities in connection with these laws we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us false claims actions may have to be defended private payors may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded healthcare programs any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  eprescribing the use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by federal and state law states have differing prescription format requirements which we have programmed into our software in addition in november 2005 the us department of health and human services the “hhs” announced regulations by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” related to “eprescribing and the prescription drug program” “eprescribing regulations” these eprescribing regulations were mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the eprescribing regulations set forth standards for the transmission of electronic prescriptions these standards are detailed and significant and cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility benefits inquiries drug formulary and benefit coverage information our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive 

  reimbursements both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined for example the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” was intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately 11 billion over five years effective january 1 2007 the dra changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price “amp” on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals on december 19 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the amp calculation in connection with medicaid reimbursement pending resolution of a lawsuit claiming that cms had acted unlawfully in adopting the rule on july 15 2008 the us congress enacted the medicaid improvements for patients and providers acts of 2008 “mippa” which delayed the adoption of cms’s final rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data until october 1 2009 in addition medicare medicaid and the schip extension act of 2007 require cms to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price “asp” to an actual sales volume basis we expect that the use of an amp benchmark and the revised asp calculations would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  interoperability standards there is increasing demand among customers industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups the certification commission for healthcare information technology “cchit” has developed a set of criteria defining levels of interoperability functionality and security for the industry which are still being modified and refined various federal state and foreign government agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies for example the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act “arra” of 2009 requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions if we need to upgrade our software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards in addition these changes may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue delays in achieving certification under these evolving standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our products 

mckesson corporation 

  healthcare industry consolidation in recent years the pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation as a result a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market accordingly we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and we are less able to negotiate price terms with the suppliers many healthcare organizations have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power if this consolidation trend continues it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services in addition when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems and acquisition of our clients could erode our revenue base 

our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad 

public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and will continue to update these plans as necessary however there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company’s operating results we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the canadian healthcare environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

similar to the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years to reduce costs the provincial governments provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs the ontario government revised the drug distribution system in 2006 with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act and has recently announced a review of that legislation in an attempt to further reduce costs some of the changes being considered would adversely affect the distribution of drugs pricing for prescription drugs and reduced funding for healthcare services other provinces are considering similar changes which would lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees such changes could significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit 

competition may erode our profit 

in every area of healthcare distribution operations our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition both in price and service from national regional and local fullline shortline and specialty wholesalers service merchandisers selfwarehousing chains manufacturers engaged in direct distribution and large payor organizations in addition this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment which may from timetotime decide to develop for their own internal needs supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment price quality of service and in some cases convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment 

our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms including other software services firms consulting firms shared service vendors certain hospitals and hospital groups payors care management organizations hardware vendors and internetbased companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry competition varies in size from small to large companies in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

our distribution solutions segment is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects us to risks and uncertainties 

inflation can be the partial basis of some of our us pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we also distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation an acceleration of the frequency or size of generic price decreases could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial defaults in payment a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2010 sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53 of our total consolidated revenues sales to our two largest customers cvs and rite aid represented approximately 15 and 12 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2010 accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 45 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable from cvs and rite aid were approximately 14 and 10 of total accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals pharmacies and other healthcare providers a default in payment a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we generally sell product to our customers on credit that is shortterm in nature and unsecured any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us which would reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability and cash flow further interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms which would reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 

our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems the implementation delay malfunction or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 1 facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers 2 receive process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis 3 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and 4 process payments to suppliers if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to potential loss 

in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment’s customers we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms one or more large casualty losses caused by fire earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

we could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by our insurance and may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution manufacturing dispensing of pharmaceuticals and medicalsurgical supplies the provision of ancillary services the conduct of our payor businesses which include disease management programs and our nurse triage services and the provision of products that assist clinical decisionmaking and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if customers assert liability claims against our products andor services any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract however the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages we also maintain general liability coverage however this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger selfinsured retentions or exclusions for certain products in addition the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations 

our healthcare technology businesses the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment deliver enterprisewide clinical patient care financial supply chain strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals physicians homecare providers retail and mail order pharmacies and payors challenges in integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment 

future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete the success of our technology businesses will depend in part on our ability to be responsive to technological developments legislative initiatives pricing pressures and changing business models to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of third party licenses utilized by our technology businesses may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we license the rights to use certain technologies from thirdparty vendors to incorporate in or complement our various healthcare technology products and solutions which are primarily offered through our technology solutions segment these licenses are generally nonexclusive must be renewed periodically by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license as a result we may have to discontinue delay or reduce product shipments until we obtain equivalent technology which could hurt our business our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us in addition if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 

mckesson corporation 

proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology in addition despite protective measures we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying reverseengineering or other infringement although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties from timetotime third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future if we were found to be infringing others’ rights we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop noninfringing technology obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing technology additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets to enforce our patent copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming these litigation expenses damage payments or costs of developing replacement technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the software and software systems “systems” that we sell or operate are very complex as with complex systems offered by others our systems may contain errors especially when first introduced for example our technology solutions segment’s business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients clinicians or patients in addition such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales 

failure of a client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages 

various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center exposing us to significant costs 

we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of thirdparty vendors for our customers the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption andor damage from a number of sources many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 1 power loss and telecommunications failures 2 fire flood hurricane and other natural disasters 3 software and hardware errors failures or crashes and 4 computer viruses hacking and similar disruptive problems we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans separate test systems and change control and system security measures but our precautions may not protect against all problems if customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities we could be exposed to significant claims particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon thirdparty providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services 

mckesson corporation 

regulation of our distribution businesses and regulation of our computerrelated products could impose increased costs delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our business 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration the “dea” the fda various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the hhs cms and other comparable agencies certain of our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and comply with operating and security standards of the dea the fda hhs various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

in addition the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computerassisted products as medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements upon us if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance of products withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution any final fda policy governing computer products once issued may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

regulations relating to confidentiality of sensitive personal information and to format and data content standards could depress the demand for our products and impose significant product redesign costs and unforeseen liabilities on us 

state federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures regulations currently in place including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply although our systems are being updated and modified to comply with the current requirements of state and foreign laws and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the hitech act evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to redesign our products in a timely manner either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in february 2010 certain provisions of the federal security and privacy standards have been extended to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payor and provider customers furthermore failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims fines and penalties costs for remediation and harm to our reputation 

mckesson corporation 

the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation how and when to implement replace or expand an information system or modify or add business processes are major decisions for healthcare organizations many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer recent legislation that provides incentives to purchase health information systems imposes strict conditions on these incentives including the requirement that purchased systems must comply with applicable federallyendorsed standards to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication our customers may delay or cancel their purchase decisions any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract termination of the agreement damages andor penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired 

we are required under u s generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations there are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating economic political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations based in foreign countries including canada the united kingdom other european countries asia pacific and israel and we have a large investment in mexico in the future we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments however increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region importexport regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political changes and natural disasters some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

mckesson corporation 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from timetotime various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully 

an element of our strategy is to identify pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise including internal control over financial reporting challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and a potential material adverse impact on operating results in addition we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions which may or may not be attainable if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected 

continued volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions reduced lending activity by other financial institutions decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability terms and cost of credit in the future including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 

our 11 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in midmay 2010 although we did not use this facility in 2010 we have historically used it to fund working capital requirements as needed we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration if our use of the current accounts receivable sales facility is characterized as a secured borrowing rather than a sale for us gaap purposes under accounting pronouncements that will become effective for us in 2011 we may be required to consider the funds obtained by us under this facility and the related liens in the covenant compliance calculations for certain of our other financing arrangements although we believe we will be able to renew this facility there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change their terms of sale additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees returned products or incentives any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow

results of operations 

  overview 

 

revenues increased 2 to 1087 billion in 2010 and 5 to 1066 billion in 2009 the increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97 of our consolidated revenues to a lesser extent revenues for 2010 were also affected by an increase in demand related to the flu season these increases were partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009 revenues for 2009 were increased by our acquisitions of oncology therapeutics network “otn” in october 2007 and mcqueary brothers drug company “mcqueary brothers” in may 2008 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 75 to 19 billion in 2010 and decreased 27 to 11 billion in 2009 the increase in 2010 was due to improved gross profit lower operating expenses compared to 2009 which included the 493 million average wholesale price “awp” litigation charge discussed below and increases in other income partially offset by higher interest expense the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2009 was due to higher operating expenses primarily caused by the awp litigation charge and due to lower other income partially offset by improved gross profit

gross profit increased 6 to 57 billion and 7 to 54 billion in 2010 and 2009 as a percentage of revenues gross profit increased 18 basis points “bp” to 522 and 11 bp to 504 in 2010 and 2009 gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily reflecting an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our distribution solutions and technology solutions segments the increase in our 2009 gross profit margin was primarily due to an improvement in our distribution solutions segment margin partially offset by a decline in our technology solutions segment margin 

operating expenses were 37 billion 42 billion and 35 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 which included the awp litigation charge as further discussed under the caption “operating expenses” in this financial review excluding the awp litigation charge operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower profit sharing investment plan “psip” expense as more fully described under the caption “operating expenses” in this financial review cost containment efforts the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation as noted above operating expenses for 2009 included a pretax charge of 493 million for the awp litigation charge 

in 2010 other income net includes a 17 million pretax gain 14 million aftertax from the sale of our 50 equity interest in mckesson logistics solutions llc “mls” in 2009 other income net includes a pretax impairment charge of 63 million 60 million aftertax on two equityheld investments and a pretax gain of 24 million 14 million aftertax from the sale of an equityheld investment over the last two years other income net was negatively affected by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and in 2009 was affected by a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance 

interest expense increased 30 to 187 million in 2010 and 1 to 144 million in 2009 interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of 700 million of longterm notes in february 2009 interest expense for 2009 reflects the repayment of 150 million of longterm debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of 700 million of longterm debt during the fourth quarter of 2009 

our reported income tax rates were 322 227 and 321 in 2010 2009 and 2008 in 2009 current income tax expense included 111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which 87 million represents a noncash benefit these benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest the recognition of these discrete items is primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations 

net income was 1263 million 823 million and 990 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 and diluted earnings per common share were 462 295 and 332 which were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases from 2008 to 2010

  revenues 

 

total revenues increased 2 to 1087 billion in 2010 and 5 to 1066 billion in 2009 the growth in revenues was primarily driven by our distribution solutions segment which accounted for approximately 97 of revenues 

direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers offset in part by the greater sales of lower priced generic drugs this increase was partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009 direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting market growth our acquisitions of otn in october 2007 and mcqueary brothers in may 2008 and a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery 

sales to customers’ warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to prior year primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid2009 partially offset by expanded business with existing customers sales to customers’ warehouses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting a customer’s loss of business the loss of a large customer and reduced revenues associated with the consolidation of certain customers additionally 2009 revenues were also impacted by a shift to direct store delivery these decreases were partially offset by expanded business with existing customers 

sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large selfwarehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers’ warehouses this distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the company as a standalone service rather it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal selfwarehousing distribution network sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the company as one source for both their directtostore business and their warehouse business we generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low costtoserve model on to the customer these sales do however contribute to our gross profit dollars 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the customer mix of our us pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows 

 

in 2010 the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to the company’s retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago while it declined in 2009 in 2009 this decline resulted in a positive impact on the company’s gross profit margin as previously described a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both the company’s direct and warehouse distribution methods the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low costtoserve model when evaluating and pricing customer contracts we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability as a result we do not evaluate the company’s performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales 

canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased on a constant currency basis by 7 from prior year primarily due to market growth which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers and a favorable foreign exchange rate of 3 canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2009 increased slightly primarily reflecting market growth which was almost fully offset by 9 unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of a customer 

medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers medicalsurgical distribution and services revenues increased for 2009 from prior year primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions in addition revenues in 2008 were impacted by the discontinuance of the distribution of a product line revenues associated with this product line are now recorded by our us pharmaceutical distribution and services business 

technology solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to prior year due to higher services revenues primarily caused by increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base these increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales technology solutions revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to increased services revenues primarily reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base and outsourcing revenues for claims processing these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a decrease in software revenues particularly in the hospital and physician office customer channels

  gross profit 

 

gross profit increased 6 to 57 billion in 2010 and 7 to 54 billion in 2009 as a percentage of revenues gross profit increased by 18 bp in 2010 and 11 bp in 2009 gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments our distribution solutions segment margin increased primarily due to flurelated demand our technology solutions segment margin improved reflecting a change in revenue mix in 2009 the increase in our distribution solutions gross profit margin was partially offset by a decline in our technology solutions segment reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition of 21 million of disease management deferred revenues in 2008 for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred 

in 2010 our distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to the impact of the h1n1 flu virus which helped drive an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flurelated demand across our distribution businesses gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy side margin which primarily reflects compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs these benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin our lastin firstout “lifo” net inventory expense was 8 million for 2010 and 2009 

in 2009 our distribution solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2008 gross profit margin was impacted by the benefit of increased sales of generic drugs with higher margins higher buy side margins and an increase associated with a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to sales to customers’ warehouses which generally have lower gross profit margins relative to other revenues within the segment these increases were partially offset by a modest decline in sell margin during the latter part of the year and lifo net inventory credits 8 million lifo net expense in 2009 compared to a 14 million lifo net credit in 2008 

our distribution solutions segment uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods the practice in the distribution solutions’ distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers manufacturers generally provide us with price protection which limits pricerelated inventory losses price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in this financial review 

for each of the last three years the company’s sales to customers’ warehouses represented 5 or less of the segment’s total gross profit dollars in 2010 the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to our retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago while it declined in 2009 in 2009 this decline resulted in a positive impact on the company’s gross profit margin 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

in 2010 our technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin was favorably affected by a change in revenue mix partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate 

in 2009 our technology solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition in 2008 of 21 million of disease management deferred revenues for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred 

  operating expenses 

 

 

operating expenses decreased 12 to 37 billion in 2010 and increased 18 to 42 billion in 2009 operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 which included the awp litigation charge as more fully described below excluding the awp litigation charge operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower psip expense as more fully described below cost containment efforts the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives 

excluding the awp litigation charge operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation 

the mckesson corporation psip is a member of the settlement class in the consolidated securities litigation action on april 27 2009 the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds on october 9 2009 the psip received approximately 119 million of the consolidated securities litigation action proceeds approximately 42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of mckesson common stock owned by the psip participants during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010 approximately 77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares the “unallocated proceeds” of mckesson common stock owned by the psip in an employee stock ownership plan “esop” suspense account in accordance with the plan terms the psip distributed all of the unallocated proceeds to current psip participants after the close of the plan year in april 2010 the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip was reimbursement for the loss in value of the company’s common stock held by the psip in its esop suspense account during the consolidated securities litigation action classholding period and was not a contribution made by the company to the psip or esop accordingly there were no accounting consequences to the company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the unallocated proceeds by the psip 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

the company’s psip expense for the full year is negligible as the company did not make additional contributions to the psip or esop as a result our compensation expense in 2010 was lower than 2009 during 2009 and 2008 psip expense was 53 million and 13 million the expense for 2008 was lower than 2009 due to the utilization of lower cost basis shares from the esop to fund our matching contributions the expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately 58 million 

psip expense by segment for the last three years was as follows 

 

 over the last three years we recorded the following reduction in workforce and restructuring charges

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

on a segment basis distribution solutions’ operating expenses decreased in 2010 and increased in 2009 primarily due to the 493 million awp litigation charge in 2009 excluding the awp litigation charge operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009 lower psip expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions 

excluding the awp litigation charge operating expenses in 2009 increased primarily due to business acquisitions and additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to the awp litigation charge as well as additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth 

as discussed in financial note 18 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to first databank inc’s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for 350 million we also recorded an accrual for pending and expected awprelated claims by public payors which is currently estimated to be 143 million the combination of the awp settlement for all private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected awprelated claims by public payors resulted in a pretax noncash charge of 493 million in the third quarter of 2009 

technology solutions segment’s operating expenses decreased over the past two years operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower psip expense cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009 partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities operating expenses for 2009 decreased primarily due to cost containment efforts and a decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in net research and development expenses and additional costs for business acquisitions operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for this segment decreased for 2009 primarily reflecting the segment’s cost containment efforts and a more favorable business mix 

corporate expenses have increased over the last two years corporate expenses for 2010 increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs other business initiatives and legal settlement charges partially offset by the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual corporate expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting an increase in accounts receivable sales facility fees compensation expense and additional costs incurred to support various initiatives 

  other income net 

 

in 2010 other income net includes a 17 million pretax gain 14 million aftertax from the sale of our 50 equity interest in mls the gain on sale of our investment in mls was recorded within our distribution solutions segment the increase in other income net was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates in 2010 interest income which is primarily recorded in corporate was 16 million 31 million and 89 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 

in 2009 other income net included a pretax impairment charge of 63 million 60 million aftertax on two equityheld investments as further described below and a pretax gain of 24 million 14 million aftertax from the sale of our 42 equity interest in verispan llc “verispan” the impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in verispan were both recorded within our distribution solutions segment excluding these items other income net decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest income from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and interest rates 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

we evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that the fair value of our interest in parata was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was otherthantemporary fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates we determined the impairment was otherthantemporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and weak market conditions as a result we recorded a pretax impairment of 58 million 55 million aftertax on this investment which is recorded within other income net in the consolidated statements of operations our investment in parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our distribution solutions segment 

during the fourth quarter of 2009 we also recorded a pretax impairment of 5 million 5 million aftertax on another equityheld investment within our distribution solutions segment 

  segment operating profit and corporate expenses 

 

 in 2010 operating profit margin for our distribution solutions segment increased primarily due to a higher gross profit margin lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and the gain on sale of the segment’s 50 equity investment in mls operating expenses improved due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009 and lower psip expense partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our business acquisitions results for 2009 included the 493 million awp litigation charge 63 million of pretax charges to writedown two equityheld investments and a 24 million pretax gain on the sale of the segment’s 42 equity investment in verispan 

in 2009 operating profit margin in our distribution solutions segment decreased compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as a result of the awp litigation charge and a decrease in other income partially offset by a higher gross profit margin

  litigation credit net in 2010 and 2008 we recorded net credits of 20 million and 5 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation 

  interest expense interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of 700 million of longterm notes in february 2009 interest expense increased slightly in 2009 compared to the prior year which reflects the repayment of 150 million of longterm debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of 700 million of longterm debt during the fourth quarter of 2009 refer to our discussion under the caption “credit resources” within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities 

  income taxes our reported tax rates were 322 227 and 321 in 2010 2009 and 2008 in addition to the items noted below fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates 

in 2009 we recorded a 182 million income tax benefit for the awp litigation accrual the tax benefit could change in the future depending on the resolution of the pending and expected claims 

in 2009 current income tax expense included 111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which 87 million represents a noncash benefit these benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest the recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations 

in 2008 the us internal revenue service “irs” began its examination of our fiscal years 2003 through 2006 in 2009 and 2010 we received assessments from the canada revenue agency “cra” for a total of 62 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 2004 and 2005 we paid the cra assessments to stop the accrual of interest we have appealed the assessment for 2003 and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 and 2005 we believe we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results in nearly all jurisdictions the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination we believe that we have made adequate provision for all remaining income tax uncertainties 

in 2008 the irs completed an examination of our consolidated income tax returns for 2000 to 2002 resulting in a signed revenue agent report “rar” which was subsequently approved by the joint committee on taxation the irs and the company agreed to certain adjustments primarily related to transfer pricing and income tax credits as a result of the approved rar we recognized approximately 25 million of net federal and state income tax benefits in 2008

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition other accounting policies are described in financial note 1 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

  allowance for doubtful accounts we provide shortterm credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers or their creditors regarding the repurchase of inventories we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies which serve as collateral for the loans we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts which includes portfolio and specific reserves the company reviews accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment as a result we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt at march 31 2010 revenues and accounts receivable from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53 of consolidated revenues and 45 of accounts receivable at march 31 2010 revenues and accounts receivable from our two largest customers cvs and rite aid represented approximately 15 and 12 of total consolidated revenues and 14 and 10 of accounts receivable as a result our sales and credit concentration is significant a default in payments a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity

at march 31 2010 trade and notes receivables were 7375 million prior to allowances of 131 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 our provision for bad debts was 17 million 29 million and 41 million at march 31 2010 and 2009 the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 18 and 22 an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2010 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on receivables of approximately 7 million additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10k 

  inventories we report inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale for our distribution solutions segment the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method and the cost of canadian inventories is determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method rebates fees cash discounts allowances chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold total inventories were 94 billion and 85 billion at march 31 2010 and 2009 

the lifo method was used to value approximately 87 and 88 of our inventories at march 31 2010 and 2009 at march 31 2010 and 2009 our lifo reserves net of lcm adjustments were 93 million and 85 million lifo reserves include both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical products in 2010 and 2009 we recognized net lifo expense of 8 million and in 2008 net lifo credits of 14 million within our consolidated statements of operations in 2010 our 8 million net lifo expense related to our nonpharmaceutical products a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity a lifo credit is recognized when the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical products held in inventory 

we believe that the fifo inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory ie “market” as such our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or inventory as valued under fifo primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were 112 million and 107 million higher than fifo as of march 31 2010 and 2009 as a result in 2010 and 2009 we recorded lcm charges of 5 million and 64 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our lifo inventories to market as deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues we anticipate that lifo credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by lcm reserves 

in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slowmoving inventory by reviewing onhand quantities outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales shifts in market trends and conditions changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories we provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory if indicated as a result of these reviews these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results

  business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

prior to april 1 2009 amounts allocated to acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” were expensed at the date of acquisition effective april 1 2009 acquired iprd is measured at fair value using market participant assumptions and initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset capitalized iprd is amortized over its estimated useful life once the asset is put in service capitalized iprd is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management effective april 1 2009 contingent consideration is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period and changes to the fair value are included in the current period’s earnings contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured subsequently 

several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we typically use the income method this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives refer to financial note 2 “business combinations and investments” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

  goodwill as a result of acquiring businesses we have 3568 million and 3528 million of goodwill at march 31 2010 and 2009 we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant changes in the use of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company’s stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level which is generally defined as a component — one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit components that have essentially similar operations products services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units if the carrying value exceeds the fair value a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations fair values can be determined using the market income or cost approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach under the market approach we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return in addition we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value 

some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include longterm growth rates projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units 

estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time the judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management any changes in key assumptions including failure to meet business plans a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge 

in 2010 and 2009 we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

  supplier incentives fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold we consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory 

  supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances as of march 31 2010 and 2009 supplier reserves were 89 million and 113 million all of the supplier reserves at march 31 2010 and 2009 pertain to our distribution solutions segment a hypothetical 01 percentage increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a percentage of trade payables would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately 13 million in 2010 the ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate

  income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal state and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses we had deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances of 1187 million and 1447 million at march 31 2010 and 2009 and deferred tax liabilities of 1845 million and 1889 million deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation including inventory valued at lifo and other assets we established valuation allowances of 97 million against certain deferred tax assets which primarily relate to federal state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future should tax laws change including those laws pertaining to lifo our cash flows could be materially impacted 

if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change an increasedecrease of 1 in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increaseddecreased tax expense by approximately 19 million or 007 per diluted share for 2010 

  sharebased compensation our compensation programs include sharebased compensation we account for all sharebased compensation transactions using a fairvalue based measurement method the sharebased compensation expense is recognized for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions for awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis for awards with performance conditions and a single vest date we recognize the expense on a straightline basis 

we estimate the grantdate fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes optionspricing model we believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events the key factors influencing the estimation process among others are the expected life of the option the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield in determining the expected life of the option we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns we use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor we believe that this marketbased input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations once the fair values of employee stock options are determined current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed even if the estimates used are different from actual experience 

mckesson corporation 

financial review continued 

in addition we develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on sharebased compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements we reassess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures as required the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates 

our assessments of estimated sharebased compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact these variables include the volatility of our stock price employee stock option exercise behavior timing number and types of annual sharebased awards and the attainment of performance goals as a result the future sharebased compensation expense may differ from the company’s historical amounts 

  loss contingencies we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business we record a provision for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable these decisions often involve a series of complex assessments by management about future events that can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions and it is possible that the actual cost of these matters could impact our earnings either negatively or positively in the period of their resolution 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we expect our available cash generated from operations together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and shortterm borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper will be sufficient to fund our longterm and shortterm capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements in addition from timetotime we may access the longterm debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities 

net cash flow from operating activities was 2316 million in 2010 compared to 1351 million in 2009 and 869 million in 2008 operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the awp litigation private payor settlement payments of 350 million cash flows from operations can also be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors 

operating activities for 2009 include a noncash charge of 493 million and the related income tax benefit of 182 million for the awp litigation charge operating activities for 2009 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory inventory net of drafts and accounts payable 

operating activities for 2008 were affected by a use of cash of 962 million due to the release of restricted cash for our consolidated securities litigation action in addition operating activities in 2008 reflect changes in our working capital accounts due to revenue growth

financing activities for 2008 included 17 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases and 70 million of dividends paid partially offset by 354 million of cash receipts from common stock issuances 

the company’s board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson’s common stock from timetotime in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions through accelerated share repurchase programs or by any combination of such methods the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price corporate and regulatory requirements restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions this authorization is described in more detail in financial note 19 “stockholders’ equity” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company repurchased 299 million 484 million and 1686 million of its common stock at average prices of 4147 5052 and 5948 as of march 31 2010 531 million remained available for future repurchases under the outstanding april 2008 board approved share repurchase plan in april 2010 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10 billion of the company’s common stock 

in july 2008 the board authorized the retirement of shares of the company’s common stock that may be repurchased from timetotime pursuant to its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2009 all of the 4 million repurchased shares which we purchased for 204 million were formally retired by the company the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paidin capital and retained earnings as such 165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings 

the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

although we believe that our operating cash flow financial assets current access to capital and credit markets as evidenced by our debt issuance in february 2009 including our existing credit and sales facilities will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing

 our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31 2010 included approximately 12 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation doing so could subject us to us federal state and local income tax we may temporarily access cash held by foreign subsidiaries without subjecting us to us federal state and local income tax through intercompany loans a notice issued by the irs in january 2009 announced that the treasury department will for a temporary period extend the permitted duration of such intercompany loans that qualify for suspended deemed dividend treatment under section 956 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended pursuant to the irs notice such intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to the us parent must be less than 60 days in duration and borrowing activities cannot exceed 180 cumulative days during the year at march 31 2010 there were no intercompany loans outstanding the position set forth in the notice will apply for the company until march 31 2011 

working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable deferred revenue and other current liabilities our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements 

consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2010 compared to march 31 2009 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of 215 million of our longterm debt in march 2010 consolidated working capital increased at march 31 2009 compared to march 31 2008 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable partially offset by our 493 million awp litigation accrual and a higher current portion of longterm debt 

our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at march 31 2010 compared to march 31 2009 primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of 215 million of our longterm debt in march 2010 this ratio decreased at march 31 2009 compared to march 31 2008 primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by our issuance of 700 million of longterm debt 

the company has paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of 006 per share on its common stock since the fourth quarter of 1999 in april 2008 the quarterly dividend was raised from six cents to twelve cents per share the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company’s future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors in 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid total cash dividends of 131 million 116 million and 70 million

the table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at march 31 2010 

 

 at march 31 2010 the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions excluding associated interest and penalties was approximately 514 million this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the company has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table 

in addition at march 31 2010 our banks and insurance companies have issued 111 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs

  accounts receivable sales facility 

in may 2009 we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility for an additional oneyear period under terms similar to those previously in place the renewed facility will expire in midmay 2010 based on our existing accounts receivable sales facility agreement we anticipate that activity under this facility may for us gaap purposes be considered as a secured borrowing rather than a sale under accounting standards that will become effective for us on april 1 2010 we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration the aggregate commitment of the purchasers under this facility is 11 billion although from timetotime the available amount may be less than that amount based on concentration limits and receivable eligibility requirements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  interest rate risk our longterm debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates whereas our shortterm borrowings are at variable interest rates if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 bp in 2010 interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported 

our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates should interest rates decline our interest income may be negatively impacted if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2010 interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately 16 million 

as of march 31 2010 and 2009 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 2548 million and 2545 million the estimated fair value of our longterm debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance our credit ratings changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms 

  foreign exchange risk we derive revenues and earnings from canada the united kingdom ireland other european countries israel asia pacific and mexico which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans as of march 31 2010 an adverse 10 change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk

 the following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by the company’s stockholders the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors except for the portion of the 2005 stock plan related to nonemployee directors which is administered by the committee on directors and corporate governance 

  2005 stock plan the 2005 stock plan was adopted by the board of directors on may 25 2005 and approved by the company’s stockholders on july 27 2005 the 2005 stock plan initially provided for the grant of up to 13 million shares in the form of nonqualified stock options incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance shares and other sharebased awards the 2005 stock plan was subsequently amended by the board of directors on may 23 2007 to increase the common stock reserved for issuance by 15 million shares which was approved by stockholders on july 25 2007 for any one share of common stock issued in connection with a stocksettled stock appreciation right restricted stock award restricted stock unit award performance share or other sharebased award two shares shall be deducted from the shares available for future grants shares of common stock not issued or delivered as a result of the net exercise of a stock appreciation right or option shares used to pay the withholding taxes related to a stock award or shares repurchased on the open market with proceeds from the exercise of options shall not be returned to the reserve of shares available for issuance under the 2005 stock plan

nonemployee directors receive an annual grant of up to 5000 rsus which vest immediately however payment of any shares is delayed until the director is no longer performing services for the company the 2005 stock plan replaced the 1997 nonemployee directors equity compensation and deferral plan

other information about the business 

  customers in recent years a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers during 2007 sales to our largest customer caremark rx inc and ten largest customers accounted for approximately 11 and 51 of our total consolidated revenues at march 31 2007 accounts receivable from caremark rx inc and our ten largest customers were approximately 12 and 48 of total accounts receivable the majority of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our pharmaceutical solutions segment 

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 10 of our purchases in 2007 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good the ten largest suppliers in 2007 accounted for approximately 55 of our purchases 

over the past few years our us pharmaceutical distribution business has changed how it is compensated for the logistical capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically a significant portion of compensation from the manufacturers was inflationbased we purchased and held pharmaceutical inventory in anticipation of manufacturers increasing their prices we benefited when the manufacturers increased their prices as we sold the inventory being held at the new higher prices commencing in 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers implemented a number of changes such as restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers these changes limited our ability to purchase inventory in advance of price increases and led to volatility in our gross profit in 2005 manufacturers also reduced the number and average magnitude of price increases 

by early 2006 we had revised most of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers under these new arrangements a significant portion of our compensation from the manufacturers is generated based on a percentage of purchases and as a result we are no longer as dependent upon pharmaceutical price increases we continue to have certain distribution arrangements with manufacturers that include an inflationbased compensation component while other arrangements remain structured under the historical inflationbased compensation model 

mckesson corporation 

for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could adversely impact our gross profit margin in 2007 we benefited from certain branded manufacturers’ price increases on selected drugs

in addition with the transition to these new arrangements purchases from certain manufacturers are better aligned with customer demand and as a result net financial inventory inventory net of accounts payable decreased in 2006 this decrease had a positive impact on our cash flow from operations these new arrangements also have somewhat diminished the seasonality of gross profit margin which has historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

  research and development our research and development “rd” expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software development held for sale we expended 359 million 285 million and 232 million for rd activities in 2007 2006 and 2005 and of these amounts we capitalized 21 22 and 21 rd expenditures are primarily incurred by our provider technologies segment and payor group our provider technologies segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals we believe a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our rd activities is included in financial note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “significant accounting policies” appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

  environmental legislation we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in financial note 17 “other commitments and contingent liabilities” appearing in this annual report on form 10k other than any expenditures that may be required in connection with those legal matters we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2007 and is not expected to be material in the next year

  suppliers over the past few years our us pharmaceutical distribution business has encountered a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers historically a significant portion of compensation from the manufacturers was inflationbased we purchased and held pharmaceutical inventory in anticipation of manufacturers increasing their prices we benefited when the manufacturers increased their price as we sold the inventory being held at the new higher price beginning in 2003 branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to assert control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers manufacturers also increasingly sought more data concerning product sales and distribution patterns we believe that the manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater control over product supply and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to and distributed in the secondary market these changes limited our ability to purchase inventory in advance of price increases in 2005 manufacturers also reduced the number and average magnitude of price increases as a result gross profit margin for our us pharmaceutical distribution business decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 

commencing in the second half of 2005 we started revising some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers under these new arrangements a significant portion of our compensation from the manufacturers is generated based on a percentage of purchases and as a result we are no longer as dependent upon pharmaceutical price increases these distribution arrangements are however subject to compliance with various customary performance requirements 

by the end of 2005 our us pharmaceutical distribution business had transitioned or was in the process of transitioning to these new distribution arrangements with almost all of the manufacturers this process was essentially completed in early 2006 and as a result our buy side margins increased in 2006 we continue to have certain distribution arrangements with manufacturers that still include an inflationbased compensation component while other arrangements remain structured under the historical inflationbased compensation model for these manufacturers a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could adversely impact segment gross profit margin 

in addition with the transition to these new arrangements purchases from certain of the manufacturers are better aligned with customer demand and as a result net financial inventory inventory net of accounts payable has decreased this decrease has had a positive impact on our cash flow from operations these new arrangements also have somewhat diminished the seasonality of gross profit margin which has historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases 

  research and development our research and development “rd” expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software development held for sale we expended 285 million 232 million and 230 million for rd activities in 2006 2005 and 2004 and of these amounts we capitalized 22 21 and 25 rd expenditures are primarily incurred by our provider technologies segment payor group and retail automation businesses our provider technologies segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals we believe a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our rd activities is included in financial note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “significant accounting policies” appearing in this annual report on form 10k

mckesson corporation   suppliers during 2005 the us healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services business entered into restructured distribution agreements with certain pharmaceutical manufacturers that modify the way we are compensated for our distribution and other related logistic and administrative services and data this transition in our business was due in part to increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control or limit the product availability in the supply channels historically a significant portion of the us healthcare’s gross margin has been derived from purchasing branded product inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and holding this inventory until a price increase occurred thereby generating a larger gross margin upon the sale of the product to customers “buy and hold” in more recent years we also entered into inventory management agreements “ima” with certain manufacturers whereby we were paid for not building investment inventories in advance of a price increase under both the buy and hold and ima gross margin dollars were predicated upon pharmaceutical price increases which contributed to volatility in the us healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services historical gross margins throughout 2005 we have been actively working with pharmaceutical manufacturers to restructure our distribution agreements towards a more feebased approach whereby we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide under these feebased agreements all or a significant portion of our compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers is fixed and is no longer dependent upon pharmaceutical price increases we have made progress towards this objective and expect to be complete by mid2006 upon completion we expect more than 80 of our pharmaceutical manufacturer compensation will not be affected by price inflation   research and development our research and development “rd” expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software development held for sale we expended 2315 million 2304 million and 2032 million for rd activities in 2005 2004 and 2003 and of these amounts we capitalized 21 25 and 26 rd expenditures are primarily incurred by our provider technologies segment payor group and retail automation businesses our provider technologies segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals we believe a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the longterm success of this business additional information regarding our rd activities is included in financial note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “significant accounting policies” appearing in this annual report on form 10k   environmental legislation  we sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations agreements with the environmental protection agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites these matters are described further in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k other than any capital expenditures that may be required in connection with those legal matters we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future the amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2005 and is not expected to be material in the next year   employees  on march 31 2005 we employed approximately 25200 persons compared to 24600 in 2004 and 24500 in 2003   financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales information as to foreign operations is included in financial notes 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements “significant accounting policies” and “segments of business” appearing in this annual report on form 10k

actions generally denying the allegations and any liability to plaintiffs the green and hall family investments actions have been consolidated for purposes of discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial discovery in the suffolk partners  curran partners  green  and hall family investments actions is proceeding in coordination with the consolidated action the gilbert action has been stayed until final disposition of the consolidated action no trial date has been set for any of these actions as a result of the company’s various pretrial motions only a single postmerger accounting oversight claim against the directors of postmerger mckesson remains to be litigated in the previouslyreported action captioned saito et al v mccall civil action no 17132 the company filed its answer to the fourth amended complaint in saito on february 8 2005 the parties are currently engaged in discovery no trial date has been set on march 30 2004 the united states attorney’s office for the

verdict has yet been issued during the third quarter of 2005 we established an additional reserve of 240 million which the company believes will be adequate to address its remaining potential exposure with respect to all other previously reported accounting litigation including the state actions discussed above that sum includes the proposed 182 million settlement amount in the hboc plan erisa action noted above however in view of the number of remaining cases the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation and the substantial amounts involved it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve the range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against the company or settlements that could require payments by the company in addition to the reserve which could have a material adverse impact on mckesson’s financial position results of operations and cash flows   ii other litigations and claims in addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various claims other pending and potential legal actions for product liability and other damages investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business these include   product liability litigation and other claims our subsidiary mckesson medicalsurgical inc is one of multiple defendants in approximately 11 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to exposure over many years to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors including mckesson medicalsurgical inc efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers we along with more than 100 other companies have been named in a lawsuit brought in 2000 by the lemelson medical educational  research foundation the “foundation” alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven 7 us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory warehousing distribution and pointofsale transactions due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought against the foundation by the manufacturers of bar code devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue the court stayed the suit against the company until the conclusion of the earlier case including any appeals that may be taken the trial in this earlier case concluded in january 2003 and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was unenforceable due to prosecutorial laches the case is now on appeal to the federal circuit court of appeals it is anticipated that oral argument will not occur before may of 2005 while the suit against the company was stayed the us patent and trademark office granted petitions for reexamination 10 

mckesson corporation of 3 of the 7 patents asserted by the foundation against the company the reexamination will determine among other things whether these patents have expired each of the remaining 4 patents in the action has already expired by its own terms or by the foundation’s disclaiming the remaining portion of the patent’s life the company is a defendant in approximately 110 california cases alleging that the plaintiffs were injured by vioxx an antiinflammatory drug manufactured by merck  company “merck” the cases typically assert causes of action for strict liability negligence breach of warranty and false advertising for improper design testing manufacturing and warnings relating to the manufacture and distribution of vioxx none of the cases involving the company is scheduled for trial the company has tendered each of these cases to merck and has reached an agreement with merck to defend and indemnify the company the company is a defendant in approximately 42 cases alleging that the plaintiffs were injured because they took the drugs known as fenphen the term commonly used to describe the weightloss combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with phentermine the company has been named as a defendant along with several other defendants in 41 cases and has accepted the tender of one of its customers named as defendant in the one remaining case the cases are pending in state courts in california and mississippi and in state and federal courts in florida and new york and typically assert causes of action for strict liability negligence breach of warranty false advertising and unfair business practices for improper design testing manufacturing and warnings relating to the distribution andor prescription of fenphen the company has tendered each of these cases to its suppliers and has reached an agreement with its major supplier to defend and indemnify the company and its customers we through our former mckesson chemical company division are named in approximately 200 cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos these cases typically involve either single or multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining materials pursuant to an indemnification agreement signed at the time of the 1986 sale of mckesson chemical company to what is now called univar usa inc “univar” we have tendered each of these actions to univar univar has raised questions concerning the extent of its obligations under the indemnification agreement and while univar continues to defend us in many of these cases it has been rejecting our tenders of new cases since february 2005 we believe univar remains obligated for all tendered cases under the terms of the indemnification agreement however we are beginning to incur defense costs in connection with these more recentlyserved actions we also believe that a portion of the claims against us will be covered by insurance and we are pursuing the available coverage on may 3 2004 judgment was entered against the company and one of its employees in the action roby v mckesson hboc inc et al superior court of yolo county california case no cv01573 former employee charlene roby brought claims for wrongful termination disability discrimination and disabilitybased harassment against the company and a claim for disabilitybased harassment against her former supervisor the jury awarded roby compensatory damages in the amount of 35 million against the company and 05 million against her supervisor and punitive damages in the amount of 150 million against the company and a nominal amount against her supervisor following posttrial motions the trial court reduced the amount of compensatory damages against the company to 28 million the punitive damages awarded against both defendants and the compensatory damages awarded against the individual employee defendant were not reduced on october 18 2004 the trial court awarded roby her attorney’s fees in the amount of 07 million the company has filed a notice of appeal seeking reduction or reversal of the compensatory and punitive damage awards and the award of attorney’s fees if these efforts are not successful the judgment in this case could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements in december 2004 the company received a request for documents from the federal trade commission “ftc” that asks the company to voluntarily produce certain documents to the ftc the document request which does not allege wrongdoing is part of an ftc nonpublic investigation to determine whether the company in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act may have engaged or may be engaging in anticompetitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution services the investigation is at an early stage and the company is in the process of responding to the ftc document request in april 2005 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of new york “nyag” requesting the production of documents responses to interrogatories and other information concerning our participation in the secondary or “alternate source” market for pharmaceutical products this investigation appears to be in its early stages and we are cooperating with the nyag and intend to be fully responsive to the subpoena 11 

mckesson corporation   environmental matters primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses which were fully divested by 1987 we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations we have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at six sites where we or entities acquired by us formerly conducted operations and we by administrative order or otherwise have agreed to take certain actions at those sites including soil and groundwater remediation in addition we are one of multiple recipients of a new jersey department of environmental protection agency directive and a separate united states environmental protection agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages “nrd” associated with one of these six sites although the company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party “prp” group in the funding of an nrd assessment the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below based on a determination by our environmental staff in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation costs for these six sites is 115 million net of approximately 2 million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or we expect based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing to be contributed by third parties the 115 million is expected to be paid out between april 2005 and march of 2028 our estimated liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying balance sheets in addition we have been designated as a prp under the comprehensive environmental compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law or its state law equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 28 sites with respect to each of these sites numerous other prps have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon prps as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with other prps our estimated liability at those 28 sites is approximately 2 million the aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in superfund matters to date have not been significant the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability the potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other prps and the extent if any to which such costs are recoverable from insurance or other parties while it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome or the duration of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section ii “other litigation and claims” we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that except as otherwise noted such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   iii contingency in 2002 we entered into a 500 million ten year contract with the national health services information authority “nhs” an organization of the british government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in england and wales the contract engages the company to develop implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 nhs locations as previously reported there have been contract delays to date which have increased costs and decreased the amount of time in which we can earn revenues these delays have adversely impacted the contract’s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract as of march 31 2005 our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of approximately 114 million in net assets consisting of prepaid expenses software and capital assets net of cash received related to this contract due to the delays and other desired modifications to the original contract we have negotiated a tentative agreement with the nhs on changes to certain key terms and conditions in the contract including a term extension and updated implementation plan we expect this contract amendment to be signed in the first quarter of the 2006 fiscal year while we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate a satisfactory system and recover our investment in this contract failure to sign the tentative agreement in its current form and or further implementation delays may result in significant losses that could be material additionally if there is further modification to the tentative amended contract terms and 12 

mckesson corporation conditions and implementation plan it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result in significant losses that could be material

suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers mckesson medical surgical inc’s insurers are providing some coverage for these cases subject to applicable deductibles we along with more than 100 other companies have been named in a lawsuit brought in 2000 by the lemelson medical educational  research foundation the “foundation” alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven 7 us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory warehousing distribution and pointofsale transactions due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought against the foundation by the manufacturers of bar code devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue the court stayed the suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case including any appeals that may be taken the trial in this earlier case concluded in january 2003 and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was invalid due to prosecutorial laches an appeal by the foundation to the federal circuit court of appeals is anticipated while the suit against the company was stayed the us patent and trademark office granted petitions for reexamination of three of the seven patents asserted by the foundation against the company the reexamination will determine among other things whether these patents have expired 15

six sites where we or entities acquired by us formerly conducted operations and we by administrative order or otherwise have agreed to take certain actions at those sites including soil and groundwater remediation in addition we were recently one of multiple recipients of a new jersey department of environmental protection agency directive and a separate united states environmental protection agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages “nrd” associated with one of these six sites although the company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party “prp” group in the funding of an nrd assessment the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below based on a determination by our environmental staff in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation costs for these six sites is 129 million net of approximately 2 million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or we expect based either on 16 

mckesson corporation agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing to be contributed by third parties the 129 million is expected to be paid out between april 2004 and march of 2028 our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in addition we have been designated as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law or its state law equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 26 sites with respect to each of these sites numerous other prps have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon prps as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with other prps our estimated liability at those 26 sites is approximately 2 million the aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in superfund matters to date have not been significant the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability the potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other prps and the extent if any to which such costs are recoverable from insurance or other parties while it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section ii “other litigation and claims” we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that except as otherwise noted such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   iii contingency in 2002 we entered into a 500 million ten year contract with the national health services information authority “nhs” an organization of the british government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in england and wales the contract engages the company to develop implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 nhs locations to date there have been delays to this contract which have caused increased costs and a decrease in the amount of time in which we can earn revenues these delays have adversely impacted the contract’s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract as of march 31 2004 our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of approximately 76 million in net assets consisting of prepaid expenses software and capital assets net of cash received related to this contract while we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate an acceptable system and recover our investment in this contract we are currently negotiating with the nhs to amend certain key terms and conditions in the contract and there is no certainty we will agree on an updated implementation plan we expect this negotiation to be completed in the second half of calendar year 2004 however the timing and the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and failure to reach agreement on an updated implementation plan and amend certain key contract terms and conditions andor further delays in the implementation may result in losses that could be material even if we agree on amended contract terms and conditions and an updated implementation plan it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result in the impairment of our net assets related to the contract as well as substantial penalties and charges which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements

federal cases were coordinated for pretrial purposes in the united states district court in the northern district of illinois and are known as mdl 997 mdl 997 consists of approximately 109 actions brought by approximately 3500 individual retail chain and supermarket pharmacies the “individual actions” in 1999 the court dismissed a related class action following a judgment as a matter of law entered in favor of defendants which was unsuccessfully appealed there are numerous other defendants in these actions including several pharmaceutical manufacturers and several other wholesale distributors these cases allege in essence that the defendants have violated the sherman act by conspiring to fix the prices of brandname pharmaceuticals sold to plaintiffs at artificially high and noncompetitive levels especially as compared with the prices charged to mailorder pharmacies managed care organizations and other institutional buyers the wholesalers’ motion for summary judgment in the individual actions has been granted plaintiffs have appealed to the seventh circuit on may 6 2002 the seventh circuit affirmed the summary judgment most of the individual cases brought by chain stores have been settled the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation recommended remand of the sherman act claims in mdl 997 and on november 2 2001 the court remanded those claims to their original jurisdictions a state court antitrust case against mckesson and other defendants is currently pending in california this case is based on essentially the same facts alleged in the federal class action and individual actions and asserts violations of state antitrust andor unfair competition laws the case  paradise drugs et al v abbott laboratories  et al  case no cv793852 was filed in the superior court of the county of santa clara and was transferred to the superior court for the county of san francisco the case is trailing mdl 997 in each of the cases plaintiffs seek remedies in the form of

other wholesale distributor defendants will be held harmless by such pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants and will be indemnified against the costs of adverse judgments if any against the wholesaler and manufacturers in these or similar actions in excess of 1 million in the aggregate per wholesale distributor defendant 15 mckesson corporation   product liability litigation and other claims our subsidiary mckesson medicalsurgical is one of many defendants in approximately 138 cases in which plaintiffs claim that they were injured due to exposure over many years to the latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors including mckesson medicalsurgical efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its suppliers are continuing and a final agreement has been reached with one major supplier mckesson medicalsurgical’s insurers are providing coverage for these cases subject to the applicable deductibles we along with 134 other companies have been named in a lawsuit brought by the lemelson medical educational  research foundation “the foundation” alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory warehousing distribution and pointofsale transactions the foundation seeks to enter into a license agreement with us the lump sum fee for which would be based upon a fraction of a percent of our overall revenues over the past ten years due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought against the foundation attacking the validity of the patents at issue the court has stayed the action until the conclusion of the earlier case iii environmental matters primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses which were divested in 1987 we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations we have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites where we or entities acquired by us formerly conducted operations and we by administrative order or otherwise have agreed to take certain actions at those sites including soil and groundwater remediation based on a determination by our environmental staff in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation costs for these five sites is approximately 13 million net of approximately 15 million which third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or which we expect based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing to be contributed by third parties the 13 million is expected to be paid out between april 2002 and march 2029 our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in addition we have been designated as a potentially responsible party or prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law or its state law equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 19 sites with respect to each of these sites numerous other prps have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon prps as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared

     the company does not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the
outcome or resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings or to estimate
the amounts of or potential range of loss with respect to these proceedings
in addition the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is
uncertain the range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include
judgments against the company or settlements that could require substantial
payments by the company which could have a material adverse impact on the
companys financial position results of operations and cash flows

  ii other litigation and claims

     in addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business the company is subject to various claims other pending and potential
legal actions for product liability and other damages investigations

complaint in intervention against foxmeyer health now known as avatex
corporation in the action filed against avatex by the foxmeyer unsecured
creditors committee in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of
delaware the complaint in intervention seeks declaratory relief and an order
enjoining avatex from pursuing the texas action

summary judgment as to the first three counts asserted in the texas action on
the ground of judicial estoppel the company filed a renewed motion for summary
judgment on the four remaining counts of avatexs complaint in the texas action
which was denied without prejudice by the delaware court on august 9 1999 in
addition the company filed crossclaims against the trustee and debtors seeking
the same relief as sought in the companys complaint against avatex based on
the order granting summary judgment as to the first three counts the texas
bankruptcy court dismissed those counts with prejudice and ordered the texas
action remanded to state court on november 30 1998 the company and the other
defendants filed a notice of appeal to the district court from the remand ruling
as well as the august 1997 ruling denying defendants motion to transfer the
texas action to delaware in addition the company has filed a counterclaim and
crossclaim against avatex and messrs estrin butler and massman in the texas
action asserting various claims of misrepresentation and breach of contract
the district court upheld the remand order and denied as moot the appeal from
the order denying transfer a crossappeal by avatex from the order dismissing
the first three counts with prejudice failed as the district court affirmed the
bankruptcy courts dismissal by order dated march 28 2001 the company and
several of the other defendants appealed to the court of appeals the ruling
upholding the order denying transfer but subsequently moved to dismiss the
appeal with prejudice which motion was granted and the appeal was dismissed on
october 4 1999 as a result the texas action is now pending in texas state
court and the parties presently are engaged in discovery on the merits of the
various claims asserted in the texas action

     c product liability litigation

     the company has been named as a defendant or has received from customers
tenders of defense in fifteen pending cases alleging injury due to the diet
drug combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine and phentermine all of the
cases are pending in the state courts of california nebraska and new jersey
the companys tender of the cases to the manufacturers of the drugs has been
accepted and the manufacturer is paying for counsel and fully indemnifying the
company for judgments or settlements arising from its distribution of the
manufacturers products

     certain subsidiaries of the company ie mgm and redline collectively the
subsidiaries are two of the defendants in approximately ninety cases in which
plaintiffs claim that they were injured due to exposure over many years to the
latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed
by a number of distributors including the subsidiaries efforts to resolve
tenders of defense to their suppliers are continuing and a tentative final
agreement has been reached with one major supplier the subsidiaries insurers
are providing coverage for these cases subject to the applicable deductibles

     there is one remaining state court class action in south carolina filed
against mgm on behalf of all health care workers in that state who suffered
accidental needle sticks that exposed them to potentially contaminated bodily
fluids arising from mgms distribution of allegedly defective syringes mgms
suppliers of the syringes are also named defendants in this action the tender
of all cases has been accepted by the two major suppliers by this acceptance
these suppliers are paying for separate distributors counsel and have agreed to
fully indemnify the company for any judgments in these cases arising from its
distribution of their products

     the company along with 134 other companies has been named in a lawsuit
brought by the lemelson medical educational  research foundation the
foundation alleging that the company and its subsidiaries are infringing seven
7 us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for
the automated management and control of product inventory warehousing
distribution and pointofsale transactions the foundation seeks to enter into
a license agreement with the company the lump sum fee for

                                        12
page   15

which would be based upon a fraction of a percent of the companys overall
revenues over the past ten years due to the pendency of earlier litigation
brought against the foundation attacking the validity of the patents at issue
the court has stayed the action until the conclusion of the earlier case the
company is assessing its potential exposure and evaluating the foundations
claim with the assistance of expert patent counsel after which it will
determine an appropriate course of action

     d environmental matters

     primarily as a result of the operation of its former chemical businesses
which were divested in fiscal 1987 the company is involved in various matters
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations

     the company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies
relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly required to address
environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites where the company or
entities acquired by the company formerly conducted operations and the
company by administrative order or otherwise has agreed to take certain
actions at those sites including soil and groundwater remediation

     the current estimate determined by the companys environmental staff in
consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel of the upper
limit of the companys range of reasonably possible remediation costs for these
five sites is approximately 13 million net of approximately 15 million which
third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or which the company expects
based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing to
be contributed by third parties the 13 million is expected to be paid out
between april 2001 and march 2029 and is included in the companys recorded
environmental liabilities at march 31 2001

     in addition the company has been designated as a potentially responsible
party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law or its state law
equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the
companys alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 21 sites with respect to
each of these sites numerous other prps have similarly been designated and
while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several
liability upon prps as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically
shared with other prps the companys estimated liability at those 21 prp sites
is approximately 15 million the aggregate settlements and costs paid by the
company in superfund matters to date has not been significant the 15 million
is included in the companys recorded environmental liabilities at march 31
2001

     the potential costs to the company related to environmental matters is
uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution
and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and
regulations and their interpretations the timing varying costs and
effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other prps and the extent if any to
which such costs are recoverable from insurance or other parties

     except as specifically stated above with respect to the litigation matters
summarized under accounting litigation section i above management
believes based on current knowledge and the advice of the companys counsel
that the outcome of the litigation and governmental proceedings discussed in
this item 3 will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial
position results of operations or cash flows



item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders

     no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise during the three months ended march 31
2001

     internal growth in health care supply management is due primarily to
increased sales volume to the retail chain and institutional customer segments
sales to retail customers have benefited from the companys service offerings
and programs that focus on broad product selection service levels inventory
carrying cost reductions connectivity and automation technologies growth with
institutional customers has benefited from the focus on reducing both product
cost and internal labor and logistics costs for the customers services
available include pharmaceutical distribution medicalsurgical supply
distribution pharmaceutical dispensing automation pharmacy outsourcing and
utilization reviews these retail chain and institutional capabilities have
resulted in the implementation of significant longterm contracts with major
customers

1 excluding sales to customer warehouses

     sales to customers warehouses are large volume sales of pharmaceuticals to
major selfwarehousing drugstore chains whereby the company acts as an
intermediary in the order and subsequent delivery of products directly from the
manufacturer to the customers warehouses the growth in sales to customers
warehouses in fiscal 2001 was due to the addition of a significant retail chain
customer and to growth from existing customers the growth in fiscal 2000 and
1999 was primarily the result of two significant contracts with retail chains
which also provided new direct store sales growth

     the operating profit margin increased in fiscal 2001 reflecting margin
expansion in the us pharmaceutical distribution and services business due to
gross margin initiatives and productivity improvements in both backoffice and
field operations and in the canadian pharmaceutical business reflecting new
customers sales

growth and operational efficiencies this impact was partially offset by a
decline in the medical management business reflecting the loss of a number of
services customers and reduced profits from the companys 22 interest in nadro
a mexican pharmaceutical distribution business the operating profit margin
declined in fiscal 2000 from 1999 due to a decline in the gross profit margin
reflecting the competitive environment a shift in the mix of pharmaceutical
distribution revenues to a higher proportion of chain business and somewhat
lower procurement profits as a percentage of revenues in the current year
procurement profits benefited in fiscal 1999 from price increases on inventory
expansion associated with new customer agreements the decline in the gross
profit margin was offset in part by a lower operating expense ratio reflecting
continuing productivity improvements the improvement in the operating expense
ratio was achieved despite higher expenses for receivable and transaction
processing related charges fiscal 1999 operating margins reflect higher margin
businesses resulting from acquisitions in pharmaceutical services for
manufacturers retail and institutional automation and medicalsurgical supply
distribution in addition expanded profitability from product procurement
warehouse automation and efficiency improvements and fixed cost leverage from
volume growth contributed to the margin expansion

     the health care supply management segment uses the lastin firstout
lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories which results in
cost of sales that more closely reflect replacement cost than other accounting
methods thereby mitigating the effects of inflation and deflation on operating
profit the practice in the health care supply management distribution
businesses is to pass published price changes from suppliers on to customers
manufacturers generally provide the company with price protection which
prevents inventory losses price declines on many generic pharmaceutical
products in this segment in each of the fiscal years ended march 31 2001 2000
and 1999 have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories
which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those fiscal years

     fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 capital expenditures include new systems
upgrades to distribution facilities and facility consolidations in the
pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical businesses and growth in the automation and
services businesses

     the health care supply management segment requires a substantial investment
in operating working capital customer receivables and inventories net of
related trade payables operating working capital is susceptible to large
variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and
seasonal demands inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity
new customer buildup requirements and the desired level of investment
inventory operating working capital at march 31 2001 was flat relative to
2000 an increase in receivables reflecting sales growth and inventories was
offset by a significant increase in vendor payables reflecting purchases made
late in the fiscal year and the timing of vendor payments no accounts
receivable were sold at march 31 2001 and 2000 operating working capital was
significantly higher at march 31 2000 compared to 1999 the working capital
increase primarily reflects increases in receivables and net financial
inventories inventories net of accounts and drafts payable resulting from
sales growth the absence of accounts receivable sales at march 31 2000
compared to 4000 million of sales at march 31 1999 and the timing of vendor
payments

     health care information technology revenues declined 9 to 09 billion in
fiscal 2001 and 22 to 10 billion in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2001 certain
contracts were entered into which the company is accounting for under the
percentage of completion method which extends the recognition of revenue over a
period of time services revenues declined reflecting the lagging impact of
reduced prior period software sales on implementation services revenues the
decline in fiscal 2000 revenues was attributable to the overall industrywide
slowdown in sales of health care information technology software and hardware
products resulting from delays in purchasing decisions that are attributed both
to year 2000 issues and a general weakness in demand for healthcare software
services revenues associated with software implementation also declined for the
same

reasons also contributing to the decline was the impact to the business caused
by the investigation into improper accounting practices and resulting senior
management changes made early in the year in addition the terms of certain
contracts for software and implementation services executed late in the fiscal
year resulted in such contracts being accounted for under the percentage of
completion accounting method revenues increased 6 to 13 billion in fiscal
1999 the fiscal 1999 decline in software revenues of 23 reflects a general
industrywide slowdown in sales of health care information technology products
and changes in accounting due to the adoption of statement of position 972
software revenue recognition effective april 1 1998 in addition during
fiscal 1999 the health care information technology segment experienced delays
in current and potential customers purchasing decisions with respect to its
enterprise solutions management believes such delays were due to year 2000

and 1999 respectively the calculation is based on yearend balances and
assumes major purchase acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the year

     the improvement in the operating working capital ratio in fiscal 2001 is
due to an increase in days sales outstanding in payables reflecting purchases
made later in the year and the timing of vendor payments the improvement in the
ratio in 2000 excluding the impact of receivable sales is due to a reduction
in yearend days sales outstanding in both customer receivables and inventory
reflecting working capital initiatives in fiscal 2000 this improvement was
offset in part by lower days sales outstanding in payables at march 31 2000
compared to march 31 1999

treasury securities with maturities of one year or less were 446 million 606
million and 262 million at march 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

     the increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in 2000
reflects proceeds from the february 2000 sale of the water products business and
a private placement of term debt see other financing activities below

working capital increase in fiscal 1999 primarily reflects increases in
receivables and inventories resulting from sales growth in all operating
segments offset in part by the higher payables balance due to the timing of
vendor payments in the health care supply management segment

     fiscal 1999 capital expenditures reflect the acquisition and construction
of the health care information technology segments new headquarters office
building

other financing activities

     in july 2000 the company announced a program to repurchase from time to
time up to 250 million of the companys shares of common stock in open market
or private transactions in fiscal 2001 the company repurchased 22 million
shares under this program for 66 million

     in october 2000 the company renewed its 364day revolving credit agreement
which allows for borrowings up to 825 million under terms substantially similar
to those previously in place except that a 364day term out option was
reinstated

     in february 2000 the company completed the sale of its whollyowned
subsidiary mckesson water products company to groupe danone for 11 billion in
cash which enabled the company to reduce shortterm borrowings and add to its
cash and marketable securities

     also in february 2000 the company completed a private placement of 335
million in term debt the proceeds of which were used to retire term debt
maturing in march 2000 and for other general corporate purposes 100 million of
the debt matures on february 28 2005 20 million matures on february 28 2007
and 215 million is due on february 28 2010

     in may 1998 the companys employee stock ownership plan purchased
approximately 13 million shares of newly issued company common stock from the
company at a market value of 78125 per share

credit resources

     the company currently has 1225 billion of available credit under
committed revolving credit lines a 400 million fiveyear facility expiring in
fiscal 2004 and an 825 million facility expiring on october 9 2001 these
revolving credit facilities are primarily intended to support commercial paper
borrowings the company also has available a committed revolving receivables
sale facility aggregating 850 million the company anticipates that this
facility will be renewed prior to its termination date of june 15 2001 at
march 31 2001 the company had no commercial paper or revolving credit
borrowings outstanding and its committed receivables sale facility was fully
available

     the companys senior debt credit ratings from sp fitch and moodys are
currently bbb bbb and baa2 respectively and its commercial paper ratings are
currently a2 f2 and p2 respectively the companys ratings are on negative
credit outlook

     management believes that the company has adequate access to credit sources
to meet its funding requirements funds necessary for future debt maturities and
other cash requirements of the company are expected to be met by existing cash
balances cash flow from operations existing credit sources or other capital

market risk

     the companys major risk exposure is changing interest rates primarily in
the united states the company manages interest rates through the use of a
combination of fixed and floating rate debt interest rate swaps may be used to
adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions
these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby
minimizing the risk of credit loss

     if interest rates on existing variablerate debt were to change 50 basis
points the company believes that its results from operations and cash flows
would not be materially affected

     the company conducts business in canada mexico france the netherlands
ireland saudi arabia kuwait australia new zealand and the united kingdom
and is subject to foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales
expenses financing and investment transactions if exchange rates on such
currencies were to fluctuate 10 the company believes that its results from
operations and cash flows would not be materially affected aggregate foreign

     average diluted shares were 2929 million in fiscal 2001 2896 million in
fiscal 2000 and 2898 million in fiscal 1999 the increase in the average
diluted shares in fiscal 2001 is due to an increase in the effect of dilutive
securities resulting from the increase in the companys stock price and an
increase in common shares outstanding common stock outstanding increased to
2840 million at march 31 2001 2834 million at march 31 2000 2806 million
at march 31 1999 due primarily to the issuance of common stock under employee
benefit plans and in fiscal 2001 by the acquisition of medivation inc
partially offset by the 22 million shares repurchased as part of the previously
discussed 250 million share repurchase program

environmental matters

     the companys continuing operations do not require ongoing material
expenditures to comply with federal state and local environmental laws and
regulations however in connection with the disposition of its chemical
operations in fiscal 1987 the company retained responsibility for certain
environmental obligations in addition the company is a party to a number of
proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation
and liability act commonly known as superfund and other federal and state
environmental statutes primarily involving sites associated with the operation
of the companys former chemical distribution businesses in fiscal 2000 a 20
million increase to the liability for these environmental matters was recorded
within discontinued operations there were no adjustments made to the reserves
in fiscal 2001 and 1999 management does not believe that changes in the
remediation cost estimates in future periods or the ultimate resolution of the
companys environmental matter will have a material impact on the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations see financial note 18
other commitments and contingent liabilities on pages f62 to f69 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements

income taxes

     the tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding unusual items
was 390 in fiscal 2001 385 in fiscal 2000 and 375 in fiscal 1999 the
increase in the effective rate from fiscal 1999 to 2001 primarily reflects the
impact of nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with purchase
acquisitions made late in fiscal 1999 and in fiscal 2000 and 2001

new accounting pronouncements

additional factors that may affect future results

     the following additional factors may affect the companys future results

adverse resolution of pending litigation regarding the restatement of the
companys historical financial statements may cause it to incur material losses

     subsequent to the companys april 28 1999 restatement of financial results
announcement and as of april 30 2001 85 lawsuits have been filed against the
company certain of the companys or hbocs current or former officers or
directors and other defendants see financial note 18 other commitments and
contingent liabilities on pages f62 to f69 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in addition the united states attorneys office for the

                          financial review continued

district office of the sec have also commenced investigations in connection with
the matters relating to the restatement of previously reported amounts

     the company does not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the
outcome or resolution of these proceedings or to estimate the amount of or
potential range of loss with respect to these proceedings in addition the
timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain the range of
possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against the
company or settlements that could require substantial payments by the company
which could cause it to incur material losses

the restatement of the companys earnings may negatively impact the management
of the companys business

     the effect of the pending litigation and government investigations could
impair the companys ability to attract and retain quality employees and
managers

changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material
negative impact on the companys revenues

     the companys products and services are intended to function within the
structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being
used in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has changed
significantly in an effort to reduce costs these changes include increased use
of managed care cuts in medicare reimbursement levels consolidation of
pharmaceutical and medicalsurgical supply distributors and the development of
large sophisticated purchasing groups the company expects the healthcare
industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these
changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or
adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient
information or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare
services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to
greatly reduce the amount of the companys products and services they purchase
or the price they are willing to pay for the companys products and services
changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could
also significantly reduce the companys income due to the diverse range of
health care supply management and health care information technology products
and services the company offers such changes may adversely impact the company
while not affecting some of the companys competitors that offer a more narrow
range of products and services

substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of the
companys products by large customers could have a significant negative impact
on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity

     the companys recent strategy has been to build relationships with a
limited number of large customers that are achieving rapid growth during the
fiscal year ended march 31 2001 sales to the companys ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 57 of the companys total revenues sales to the
companys largest customer rite aid corporation represented approximately 16
of the companys fiscal 2001 revenues as a result the companys sales and
credit concentration have significantly increased any defaults in payment or a
material reduction in purchases from the company by these large customers could
have a significant negative impact on the companys financial condition results
of operations and liquidity

the ability of the health care information technology business to attract and
retain customers due to challenges in integrating software products and
technological advances may significantly reduce the companys revenues

     the companys health care information technology business delivers
enterprisewide patient care clinical financial managed care payor and
strategic management software solutions as well as networking

technologies electronic commerce outsourcing and other services to health care
organizations throughout the united states and certain foreign countries
challenges in integrating software products used by the health care information
technology business with those of its customers could impair the companys
ability to attract and retain customers and may reduce its revenues or increase
its expenses

     future advances in the health care information systems industry could lead
to new technologies products or services that are competitive with the products
and services offered by the health care information technology business such
technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services
or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure the success of the health
care information technology business will depend in part on its ability to be
responsive to technological developments pricing pressures and changing
business models to remain competitive in the evolving health care information
systems marketplace the health care information technology business must
develop new products on a timely basis the failure to develop competitive
products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the
ability of the health care information technology business to attract and retain
customers and thereby significantly reduce the companys net income

proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights
may infringe on rights of third parties

     the company relies on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and
trademark laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical
measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products there can be no
assurance that these protections will be adequate or that the companys
competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially
equivalent or superior to the companys technology although the company
believes that its products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the
proprietary rights of third parties from time to time third parties have
asserted infringement claims against the company and there can be no assurance
that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in
the future additionally the company may find it necessary to initiate
litigation to protect the companys trade secrets to enforce its patent
copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the
proprietary rights of others these types of litigation can be costly and time
consuming these litigation expenses or any damage payments resulting from
adverse determinations of third party claims could be significant and result in
material losses to the company

potential product liability claims arising from health care information
technology business products could result in material losses to the company

     the company provides products that assist clinical decisionmaking and
relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans if these products fail
to provide accurate and timely information customers could assert liability
claims against the company litigation with respect to liability claims
regardless of the outcome could result in substantial cost to the company
divert managements attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of
the companys products the company attempts to limit by contract its liability
for damages from negligence errors or mistakes despite this precaution the
limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or
may not otherwise protect the company from liability for damages the company
maintains general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors
and omissions however this coverage may not continue to be available on
acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or
more large claims against the company in addition the insurer might disclaim
coverage as to any future claim

                          financial review continued

system errors and warranties in health care information technology business
products could cause unforeseen liabilities

     the companys health care information technology business systems are very
complex as with complex systems offered by others the companys systems may
contain errors especially when first introduced the health care information
technology business systems are intended to provide information for health care
providers in providing patient care therefore users of its products have a
greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products
generally failure of a clients system to perform in accordance with its
documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require the
company to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the
documentation if such failure is not timely remedied it could constitute a
material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract
obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant
damages

potential regulation by the us food and drug administration fda of
information technology products as medical devices could impose increased costs
delay the introduction of new products and hurt the companys business

     the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer
software intended for use in the health care setting the fda has increasingly
focused on the regulation of computer products and computerassisted products as
medical devices under the federal food drug and cosmetic act if the fda
chooses to regulate any of the companys products as medical devices it can
impose extensive requirements upon the company if the company fails to comply
with the applicable requirements the fda could respond by imposing fines
injunctions or civil penalties requiring recalls or product corrections
suspending production refusing to grant premarket clearance or approval of
products withdrawing clearances and approvals and initiating criminal
prosecution any final fda policy governing computer products once issued may
increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent
the company from marketing its products

new and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality could
depress the demand for information technology products and impose significant
product redesign costs on the company

     state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and
the circumstances under which those records may be released these regulations
govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record
information and may require the users of such information to implement specified
security measures regulations governing electronic health data transmissions
are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to apply

     the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa
requires national standards for some types of electronic health information
transactions and the data elements used in those transactions standards to
ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and national
health data privacy legislation or regulations in december 2000 final health
data privacy regulations were published which will require health care
organizations to be in compliance by april 2003 these regulations restrict the
use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information without the
prior informed consent of the patient

     evolving hipaarelated laws or regulations could restrict the ability of
the companys customers to obtain use or disseminate patient information this
could adversely affect demand for the companys products and force product
redesign in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations and protect
the privacy and integrity of patient data the company may need to expend
significant capital research and development and other resources to modify its
products to address these evolving data security and privacy issues

                          financial review concluded

the companys business could be hindered if it is unable to complete and
integrate acquisitions successfully

     an element of the companys business is to pursue strategic acquisitions
that either expand or complement its business the company routinely reviews
such potential acquisition opportunities and has historically engaged in
numerous acquisitions integration of acquisitions involves a number of special
risks such risks include

      the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the
       operations of businesses the company has acquired

      difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the
       realization of potential operating synergies

      difficulties in the integration of any acquired companies operating in a
       different sector of the health care industry

      delays or difficulties in opening and operating larger distribution
       centers in a larger and more complex distribution network

      the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired
       companies

      challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and

      potential adverse effects on operating results

     if the company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic
acquisitions in a timely manner its business and the companys growth
strategies could be negatively affected

the companys issuance of equity to finance acquisitions could have a potential
dilutive effect on its stock

     the company anticipates that it will finance acquisitions at least partly
by incurring debt or by the issuance of additional securities the use of equity
financing rather than debt for acquisitions would dilute the ownership of the
companys then current stockholders

     income tax payments were 3305 million 1216 million and 1758 million
in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

     at march 31 2001 the company had 511 million in cumulative
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries the companys earnings
from these foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested
and accordingly no provision for federal and state income taxes has been made
for these earnings these earnings could become subject to income tax if they
were remitted to the company as dividends or if a deemed distribution occurs
determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these
undistributed earnings is not practicable however the company believes that
us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us tax and offset any
foreign withholding tax

1 primarily associated with changes in executive management based on the
    terms of employment contracts

     assets of the plans are measured on a calendar year basis

     the projected unit credit method is utilized for measuring net periodic
pension cost over the employees service life costs are funded based on the
recommendations of independent actuaries the projected benefit obligations for
companysponsored plans were determined using discount rates of 75 at december
31 2000 775 at december 31 1999 and 7 at december 31 1998 and an assumed
increase in future compensation levels of 40 for all periods presented the
expected longterm rate of return on assets used to determine pension expense
was 975 for all periods

     the assets of the plan consist primarily of listed common stocks and bonds
for which fair value is determined based on quoted market prices

  profitsharing investment plan

     retirement benefits for employees not covered by collective bargaining
arrangements include a supplementary contributory profit sharing investment plan
psip the leveraged esop portion of the psip has purchased an aggregate of
243 million shares of common stock since inception these purchases have been
financed by 10 to 20year loans from or guaranteed by the company the companys
related receivables from the esop have been classified as a reduction of
stockholders equity the loans will be repaid by the esop from common dividends
on shares not yet allocated to participants interest earnings on cash balances
not yet allocated to participants common dividends on certain allocated shares
and future company cash contributions the esop loan maturities and rates are
identical to the terms of related company borrowings see financial note 10

     aftertax esop expense including interest expense on esop debt was 105
million 124 million and 14 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively the higher esop expense in fiscal 2001 and 2000 was required to
maintain a desired level of benefits provided to employees despite a decline in
the stock price additional tax benefits received on dividends paid on
unallocated shares of 09 million 11 million and 22 million in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively have been credited directly to retained
earnings in accordance with sfas no 109 contribution expense for the psip in
fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 was all esop related and is reflected in the amounts
above approximately 15 million 26 million and 06 million common shares were
allocated to plan participants in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

     through march 31 2001 162 million common shares have been allocated to
plan participants at march 31 2001 81 million common shares in the esop

     the assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 50 for all periods presented the health
care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
reported increasing the trend rate by one percentage point would increase the
accumulated postretirement health care and life insurance obligation as of march
31 2001 by 77 million and the related fiscal 2001 aggregate service and
interest costs by 07 million decreasing the trend rate by one percentage
point would reduce the accumulated postretirement health care and life insurance
obligation as of march 31 2001 by 73 million and the related fiscal 2001
aggregate service and interest cost by 06 million the discount rates used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 75 775
and 7 at march 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

judgments against the company or settlements that could require substantial
payments by the company which could have a material adverse impact on the

     c product liability litigation

     the company has been named as a defendant or has received from customers
tenders of defense in fifteen pending cases alleging injury due to the diet
drug combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine and phentermine all of the
cases are pending in the state courts of california nebraska and new jersey
the companys tender of the cases to the manufacturers of the drugs has been
accepted and the manufacturer is paying for counsel and fully indemnifying the
company for judgments or settlements arising from its distribution of the
manufacturers products

     certain subsidiaries of the company ie mgm and redline collectively the
subsidiaries are two of the defendants in approximately ninety cases in which
plaintiffs claim that they were injured due to exposure over many years to the
latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed
by a number of distributors including the subsidiaries efforts to resolve
tenders of defense to their suppliers are continuing and a tentative final
agreement has been reached with one major supplier the subsidiaries insurers
are providing coverage for these cases subject to the applicable deductibles

     there is one remaining state court class action in south carolina filed
against mgm on behalf of all health care workers in that state who suffered
accidental needle sticks that exposed them to potentially contaminated bodily
fluids arising from mgms distribution of allegedly defective syringes mgms
suppliers of the syringes are also named defendants in this action the tender
of all cases has been accepted by the two major suppliers by this acceptance
these suppliers are paying for separate distributors counsel and have agreed to
fully indemnify the company for any judgments in these cases arising from its
distribution of their products

     the company along with 134 other companies has been named in a lawsuit
brought by the lemelson medical educational  research foundation the
foundation alleging that the company and its subsidiaries are infringing seven
7 us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for
the automated management and control of product inventory warehousing
distribution and pointofsale transactions the foundation seeks to enter into
a license agreement with the company the lump sum fee for which would be based
upon a fraction of a percent of the companys overall revenues over the past ten
years due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought against the foundation
attacking the validity of the patents at issue the court has stayed the action
until the conclusion of the earlier case the company is assessing its potential
exposure and evaluating the foundations claim with the assistance of expert
patent counsel after which it will determine an appropriate course of action

     d environmental matters

     primarily as a result of the operation of its former chemical businesses
which were divested in fiscal 1987 the company is involved in various matters
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations

     the company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies
relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly required to address
environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites where the company or
entities acquired by the company formerly conducted operations and the
company by administrative order or otherwise has agreed to take certain
actions at those sites including soil and groundwater remediation

     the current estimate determined by the companys environmental staff in
consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel of the upper
limit of the companys range of reasonably possible remediation costs for these
five sites is approximately 13 million net of approximately 15 million which
third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or which the company expects
based either on agreements or

nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing to be contributed by third
parties the 13 million is expected to be paid out between april 2001 and march
2029 and is included in the companys recorded environmental liabilities at
march 31 2001

     in addition the company has been designated as a potentially responsible
party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law or its state law
equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the
companys alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 21 sites with respect to
each of these sites numerous other prps have similarly been designated and
while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several
liability upon prps as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically
shared with other prps the companys estimated liability at those 21 prp sites
is approximately 15 million the aggregate settlements and costs paid by the
company in superfund matters to date has not been significant the 15 million
is included in the companys recorded environmental liabilities at march 31
2001

     the potential costs to the company related to environmental matters is
uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution
and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and
regulations and their interpretations the timing varying costs and
effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other prps and the extent if any to
which such costs are recoverable from insurance or other parties

     except as specifically stated above with respect to the litigation matters
summarized in accounting litigation section i above management believes
based on current knowledge and the advice of the companys counsel that the
outcome of the litigation and governmental proceedings discussed above will not
have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of
operations or cash flows
