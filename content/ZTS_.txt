operating segments 

the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

• economic differences such as standards of living in developed markets as compared to emerging markets 

• cultural differences such as dietary preferences for different animal proteins pet ownership preferences and pet care standards 

• epidemiological differences such as the prevalence of certain bacterial and viral strains and disease dynamics 

• treatment differences such as utilization of different types of medicines and vaccines as well as the pace of adoption of new technologies 

• environmental differences such as seasonality climate and the availability of arable land and fresh water and 

• regulatory differences such as standards for product approval and manufacturing 

as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments 

• united states us with revenue of 4042 million or 52 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and 

• international with revenue of 3652 million or 47 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 

within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animal and livestock customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs 

in addition our client supply services css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health products together represented approximately 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer deepening the humananimal bond receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics companion animal products represented approximately 60 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to allow veterinarians and producers to care for their animals and to enable the costeffective and sustainable production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth increasing standards of living and a greater focus on sustainable food production are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive demand for improved nutrition particularly through increased consumption of animal protein second population growth leads to greater natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve and the global food chain faces increased scrutiny there is more focus on food quality sustainability safety and reliability of supply livestock products represented approximately 39 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 

in addition our css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health products together represented approximately 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021

as part of our growth strategy we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical biopharmaceutical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation primarily through our research and development rd group historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  naxcel ® and spectramast ®

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 28 sites 

7  

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

we own the majority of these sites with the exception of our facilities in buellton california us durham north carolina us klofta norway medolla italy melbourne australia san diego california us tullamore ireland union city california us and weibern austria which are leased sites 

we are currently in the process of qualifying a second manufacturing site in suzhou china 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2021 this network was comprised of 136 cmos including those centrallymanaged as well as locallymanged cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health industry which includes medicines vaccines and diagnostics we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic companies such as boehringer ingelheim animal health inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco animal health and idexx laboratories there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry historically the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians for more information regarding the generic competition we have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire see item 1 business  intellectual property  

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or those who currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2021 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

• environmentalrelated capital expenditures  approximately 11 million and 

• other environmentalrelated expenditures  approximately 16 million 

however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we currently have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy has disrupted our and our customers suppliers and vendors operations has negatively affected certain elements of our business and operations and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as the novel coronavirus covid19 the global spread of covid19 has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations sales and delivery and supply chains the spread of covid19 has resulted in authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate implementing numerous measures since late 2019 to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns of nonessential businesses there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to continue to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to impact our supply chain as we experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products any prolonged component shortages or supply chain disruption may result in manufacturing or rd delays and could limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise adversely impact our revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic also has and may continue to reduce demand for some of our products as a result of the negative impact it has had and may continue to have on our customers in particular our livestock customers have been and may continue to be challenged by voluntary or mandatory facility closures reduced packing plant capacity travel bans and quarantines inhibiting consumption of protein and transportation of live animals and labor shortages negatively impacting their operations for example a number of significant meat processing plants were 

17  

closed temporarily in 2020 after employees tested positive for covid19 and plants continue to experience periodic disruptions the resulting reduction in demand for some of our products has negatively impacted our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows if such demand reduction accelerates or is prolonged 

additionally many of our workforce continue to work remotely as a result of the pandemic remote working arrangements could result in additional complexity or inefficiency or increase operational risks including but not limited to risks associated with information technology and systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

additionally on september 9 2021 us president biden issued an executive order requiring federal employees and covered contractors to be vaccinated against covid19 on november 4 2021 the us department of labor’s occupational safety and health administration osha issued a covid19 vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or tested for covid19 on at least a weekly basis the us supreme court recently stayed implementation of this osha standard and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or impact on us our suppliers or our customers additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business while it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact the new regulations would have on us our suppliers and our customers the implementation of such government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees and result in labor disruptions further implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them and for our customers which may impact their business processes and as a result their demand for our products 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic but we anticipate that the covid19 pandemic is likely to continue to impact our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in 2022 weak global economic conditions also may exacerbate the ongoing impact of the pandemic the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this risk factors section any of which could have a material effect on us this situation continues to change rapidly especially as new variants of the virus are identified and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

our products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to our products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported which can lead to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety quality or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation or materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such concerns are accurate 

our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our topselling products 

if any of our topselling products experience issues such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation new or unexpected side effects manufacturing disruptions regulatory proceedings labeling changes negative publicity changes to veterinarian or customer preferences andor disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products our revenues could be negatively impacted perhaps significantly our five topselling products apoquel simparicasimparica trio revolutionrevolution plusstronghold cytopoint and the ceftiofur product line contributed approximately 33 of our revenue in 2021 any issues with these topselling products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations 

generic and other products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products that no longer have patent protection in certain circumstances we have been forced to lower our prices and provide discounts or rebates in order to compete with generic products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product in the years since the start of generic and other competition sales of our rimadyl chewable product have declined by approximately 19 in the us its largest market in 2021 the first year of generic competition sales of draxxin declined by 12 in the us its largest market and additional declines are expected in subsequent years 

although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health in certain markets the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics such as channel expansion customer consolidation an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

18  

some of our products patents have expired and over the next few years additional products patents will expire as described below 

• draxxin patents relating to the active ingredient tulathromycin and formulation of draxxin have expired with the exception of the active ingredient and formulation patents in japan that expire in 2023 and 2025 respectively in brazil there are patents for the active ingredient and formulation which expire in february 2022 and in 2025 respectively although their current status is uncertain generic or other competing tulathromycin products are now marketed in many markets including the us europe canada mexico and australia as well as in many smaller markets and are now marketed for swine in brazil additional marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products may be granted in various markets in the future sales of draxxin have been negatively affected by generic competition in the markets where the patents have expired 

• ceftiofur all patents relating to the active ingredient of excedenaxcel ceftiofur crystalline free acid have expired the patents covering the commercial formulation of excede in the us japan and brazil extend to 2024 2026 and 2027 respectively but the corresponding patents in europe canada and australia expired in september 2021 the commercial method of administration patent relevant to the product line expires in 2023 in the us europe and australia and in 2028 in japan generic versions of excede have entered the market in mexico and russia at this time the market entry of a generic version of excede in the us is not anticipated before 2024 

• revolutionstronghold all patents relating to revolutionstronghold containing selamectin as the sole active ingredient have expired generic versions of selamectin are now sold in markets including the us europe australia and canada selamectin is one of the active ingredients in our combination parasiticide product revolution plusstronghold plus which is separately patent protected 

• convenia the patent for the active ingredient of convenia cefovecin sodium has expired in all countries and the patents covering the commercial formulation expire in europe australia canada and japan in november 2022 in the us in october 2023 and in brazil in 2025 

• cerenia the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired in all countries and the formulation patents relevant to the injectable product line expire between 2025 and 2028 generic versions of cerenia injectable have been registered and marketed in europe and we are aware that regulatory approval of at least one generic version of cerenia injectable is currently being pursued in the us there is also a pending registration for generic version of cerenia injectable in australia 

• proheart all patents covering proheart 6 and proheart 12 have expired 

zoetis typically enforces its patents vigorously as appropriate both within and outside the us including by filing infringement claims against other parties 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies there are also many startup companies working in the animal health area we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry which could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry including startup companies could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have seen consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

19  

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in ecommerce during the covid19 pandemic companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we primarily market our companion animal products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the us in the past and may be proposed in the us or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

in the us and certain other markets these and other competitive conditions have increased and may continue to increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities divesting businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties separating businesses or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns adverse customer reactions and potential loss of key employees or customers our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient 

while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or fines resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities inadequate controls or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target’s legacy products 

any of these events could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

acquiring or implementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may acquire or implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business for example we have recently expanded our diagnostics business with additional pointofcare offerings and reference labs we are also investing in genetics and precision animal health digital technology and data analytics and insurance agency services there may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts we may invest significant time and resources in developing marketing or acquiring new lines of business andor offering new products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business andor the offering of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable our lack of experience or knowledge as well as external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service new business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services other risks include i potential diversion of management’s attention available cash and other resources from our existing businesses ii unanticipated liabilities or contingencies iii the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into or acquire the new line of business iv potential damage to existing customer relationships lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers and v the inability to compete effectively failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or 

20  

acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 

for example regulations regarding antibiotic usage in animals have been introduced in certain markets including the us the eu china france germany and vietnam in addition certain jurisdictions like italy have implemented the use of electronic prescriptions which has caused more disciplined use of antibiotics and decreased the demand for our products 

in certain markets there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated environmental or other concerns furthermore changing consumer preferences and increasing consumer interest in alternatives to animalbased protein and dairy products has driven the growth of plantbased substitutes any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions including inflation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet moreover customers may seek lower price alternatives to our products if they are negatively impacted by poor economic conditions infectious disease outbreaks pandemics and widespread fear of spreading disease through human contact can cause disruptions to or negatively impact our our customers’ and our distributors’ business operations which could materially adversely affect our operating results furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances that such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including african swine fever avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise 

21  

known as pedv have impacted the animal health business the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions natural disasters and the availability of natural resources 

weather conditions including excessive cold or heat natural disasters and other events could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed such events can also interfere with our livestock customers’ operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things for example severe droughts can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business 

furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of a natural disaster adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience natural disasters or adverse weather conditions including floods fires earthquakes and hurricanes or other storms or prolonged snow or ice particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather 

adverse weather events and natural disasters may also interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites research and development facilities and office buildings which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition especially if such interruptions to regular operations are frequent or prolonged 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are also affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

climate change could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers’ businesses 

we operate in many regions countries and communities around the world where our businesses and our activities and the activities of our customers and suppliers could be disrupted by climate change potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall prolonged droughts or flooding increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters rising sea levels and a rising heat index any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses increased temperatures and rising water levels may negatively impact our livestock customers by increasing the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals in addition changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species and trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases the physical changes caused by climate change may also prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers’ businesses climate change may negatively impact our customers’ operations particularly those in the livestock industry through climaterelated impacts such as increased air and water temperatures rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock in addition concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products if such events affect our customers’ businesses they may purchase fewer zoetis products and our revenues may be negatively impacted climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business and on our customers 

the impacts from climate change may also impact zoetis’ and our suppliers’ manufacturing processes for example ample amounts of clean water are needed to produce our products and the effects from climate change could result in water supply interruptions and low water quality in addition increased frequency of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions may disrupt our manufacturing processes or our supply chain these disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

moreover there has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future in the us there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be enacted at the federal level to address the effects of climate change such regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and taxes climate change regulation continues to evolve and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation 

modification of foreign trade policy by the us or foreign countries or the imposition of tariffs on us or foreign goods may harm our business 

changes in us laws agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results a number of our customers particularly usbased livestock producers benefit from free trade agreements the us canada and mexico reached an agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta with the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca which became effective on july 1 2020 but it 

22  

remains to be seen what the ultimate impact of the new usmca will be on our customers the new provisions of the usmca as well a s any other changes to international trade agreements or policies could harm our customers and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in response to us tariffs affecting foreign exports some foreign governments including china have instituted and may in the future institute tariffs on certain us goods while the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain tariffs imposed by the us or foreign governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the us as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers cmos or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain and hire executive officers or other key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel including research technical sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment from time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees we may not be able to maintain or expand our operations or our business could be otherwise adversely affected and could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 27 billion and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of 15 billion identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products if we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

23  

new product rd leverages discoveries of agribusiness pharmaceutical and biotechnology rd we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to molecules compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access these technologies to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

we may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products 

new products may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market within the expected or optimal timeframe or at all in addition product extensions or additional indications may not be approved developing and commercializing new products subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties including i delayed or denied regulatory approvals ii delays or challenges with producing products in accordance with regulatory requirements on a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost iii failure to accurately predict the market for new products and iv efficacy and safety concerns in addition a failure to continue to identify and develop products both internally and through external sources could impact our future success once necessary regulatory approvals are obtained the commercial success of any new product depends upon among other things its acceptance by veterinarians and end customers and on our ability to successfully manufacture market and distribute products in sufficient quantities to meet actual demand the inability to successfully bring a product to market could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations 

the evaluation of our existing and new medicines and vaccines for animals is required in order to develop and commercialize them animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2021 we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 28 manufacturing sites located in 12 countries we also employ a network of 136 thirdparty cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

• the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers including logistical service providers to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines including any changes to good manufacturing practices gmp 

• mislabeling 

• construction delays 

• equipment malfunctions 

• shortages of materials 

• labor problems including any covidrelated impacts 

• delays in receiving any required governmental authorizations or regulatory approvals including as a result of any prolonged shutdown of the us government 

• natural disasters and adverse weather conditions 

• power outages 

• criminal and terrorist activities 

• changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in types of products produced shipping distributions or physical limitations and 

• the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases at or near our production sites 

these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets in addition the regulatory agency in russia no longer accepts gmp certificates issued by outside authorities and instead requires countryspecific gmp certification based on local gmp rules as a result we have ongoing programs at the relevant manufacturing sites to satisfy the russiaspecific gmp requirements our failure to achieve these necessary certifications on a timely basis or at all could impact our ability to sell our products in russia 

24  

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors including any impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products result in product delivery delays or shortages and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants 

as part of our supply network strategy we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants we are currently invested in a new plant in suzhou china for the research and production of vaccines in china in addition certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and require licensure by various regulatory authorities significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company’s return on investment 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure or the failure of third parties we rely on including cmos to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals we have changed and may in the future change the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and because of these changes we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process including any delays resulting from covid19 or any prolonged shutdown of the us government or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the us attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially we also sell certain nutritional and diagnostic products used in human health that could increase the scope of our liability 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation 

25  

matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims and other liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved in addition certain of our products could be misused or abused by humans which could expose us to liability for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product we are also aware of some counterfeit versions of our simparica product in brazil and a field investigation is being performed in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

laws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business 

the ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions in addition engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks including risks specific to antibribery regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act 2010 and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time we have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions and sell products in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or that any businesses that we may acquire have complied with such regulations and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example in december 2020 we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to ofac and the us department of justice regarding certain transactions involving sales of food medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to iran potentially in violation of the itsr administered by ofac the sales were made by our platinum performance business which we acquired in august 2019 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could 

26  

materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and reputation may be impacted if we do not comply with continually changing laws and regulations regarding data privacy 

we collect and use personal data of our customers employees and suppliers in a variety of ways in addition we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio as a result we possess and process an increasing amount of personal data our customers employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their data 

our collection use retention storage and sharing of personal data is subject to a variety of data privacy laws and regulations in the united states and other regions where we operate as a global company we are faced with the challenge of how to manage a diverse patchwork of laws rules regulations and industry standards including the california consumer privacy act the eus general data protection regulation the uks general data protection regulation the brazilian general data protection law and china’s personal information protection law these laws and regulations vary across countries are complex and can be subject to significant change for example there are a number of legislative proposals in the eu the us both at the federal and state levels and other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business any actual or perceived failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant consequences for zoetis this includes substantial fines and penalties regulatory investigations and civil lawsuits with damages all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business in addition the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future 

risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

• volatility in the international financial markets 

• compliance with governmental controls 

• difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights 

• theft or compromise of technology data and intellectual property 

• parallel trade in our products importation of our products from eu countries where our products are sold at lower prices into eu countries where the products are sold at higher prices 

• compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations such as the fcpa and similar nonus laws and regulations including labor laws 

• burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations including those relating to environmental health and safety requirements 

• changes in laws regulations government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers including the imposition of limits on our profitability 

• political and social instability including crime civil disturbance terrorist activities and armed conflicts 

• trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities including restrictions administered by ofac and the eu in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers eg restrictions on the importation of agricultural products from the eu to russia 

• government limitations on foreign ownership 

• government takeover or nationalization of business 

• changes in tax laws and tariffs 

• imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions 

• costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing managing and monitoring international operations including the use of overseas thirdparty goods and service providers 

• corruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities 

• longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk and 

27  

• additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information 

in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

brexitrelated impacts on our business could include disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu increased legal and regulatory complexities higher costs of conducting business in europe potential inventory shortages in the uk increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with ukspecific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the uk any further changes in international trade tariff and importexport regulations as a result of brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other nontariff barriers on us it is also possible that brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees particularly those from the eu the uks vote to exit the eu could also result in similar referendums or votes in other eu member countries in which we do business any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2021 we generated approximately 44 of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro chinese renminbi brazilian real australian dollar british pound and canadian dollar we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations 

in addition certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from us laws and regulations are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and timeconsuming and requires significant resources in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to investigation costs potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 

for all these and other reasons doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or 

28  

changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example in october 2021 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd announced that its members have agreed on a twopillar approach to address the tax challenges of the digital economy pillar one amends profit allocation and nexus rules to grant more taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the physical presence of the business pillar two introduces common global minimum tax rules across the countries participating in the oecd inclusive framework such rules when implemented would operate through topup taxes and other measures if a multinational group’s income is not subject to a sufficient level of tax in a particular jurisdiction the oecd released the pillar two 15 minimum effective tax rate model rules on december 20 2021 the oecdg20 inclusive framework will continue to develop the remaining model rules and multilateral instruments which would then need to be enacted on a countrybycountry basis in order to ensure global adoption by 2023 these two pillars combined may represent a significant change in the international tax regime and there is risk of an adverse impact to our effective tax rate but the amount of such impact remains uncertain at this time 

furthermore president bidens administration has put forth comprehensive corporate tax reform proposals which may have an adverse impact to our effective tax rate at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us our distributors or licensors or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

• pay monetary damages 

• obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or 

• stop activities including any commercial activities relating to the affected products which could include a recall of the affected products andor a cessation of sales in the future 

the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action moreover even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing thirdparty patent we may choose to license such patent which would result in associated costs and obligations we may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor licensor or other third party the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all our currently pending and granted patents may be challenged in post grant review inter partes review or opposition or revocation proceedings in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the valid scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us 

29  

rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in patent law and practice in the us and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions continue to influence changes to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature biopharma and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas patent law reforms and new case law could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to adequately patent our products 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems and digital solutions make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack in addition we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio and as a result there could be an increased likelihood of a cyberattack or breach of security that could negatively impact us or our customers cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we or our third party partners may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets intellectual property and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions 

like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems networks or infrastructure they may be able to access steal publish delete misappropriate modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data moreover additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data a network disruption including one resulting from a cyberattack could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access theft publishing deletion misappropriation or modification to or of confidential data due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access 

the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant among others such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures litigation regulatory investigations fines and sanctions lost revenues from business 

30  

interruption damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs as a result a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the us and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 665 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we currently have agreements for a multiyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures business development or other general corporate requirements including dividends 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings may in the future be at variable rates of interest 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other less leveraged competitors 

• impacting our effective tax rate and 

• increasing our cost of borrowing 

in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we also hold certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our senior notes due 2028 so that a portion of the interest payable on these notes is effectively variable based on the london interbank offered rate libor in november 2020 the board of governors of the federal reserve system the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation collectively the agencies issued a statement to encourage banks to transition away from us dollar libor as soon as practicable and in any event by december 31 2021 in march 2021 the the uk financial conduct authority and 

31  

ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor announced that british pound euro swiss franc and japanese yen libor panels as well as panels for 1week and 2month us dollar libor will cease after december 31 2021 with the remaining us dollar libor panels ceasing after june 30 2023 the alternative reference rates committee in the united states has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to us dollar libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor however it is unknown whether this or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions the discontinuance or modification of libor the introduction of alternative reference rates or other reforms to libor could cause the interest rate calculated on our interest rate swap agreements associated with our senior notes due 2028 to be materially different than expected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and sp global ratings a division of sp global inc we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes however we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our thenexisting debt instruments will not allow such repurchases our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in 

32  

addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

on may 22 2013 pfizer announced an exchange offer the exchange offer whereby pfizer shareholders could exchange a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock the exchange offer was completed on june 24 2013 resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result

in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 7 2021 our board of directors declared the 2022 first quarter dividend of 0325 per share to be paid on march 1 2022 to holders of record on january 20 2022 and on february 8 2022 our board of directors declared the 2022 second quarter dividend of 0325 per share to be paid on june 1 2022 to holders of record on april 21 2022 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the us impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

• a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms 

• rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings 

• the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to act by written consent and 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to call for special meetings 

in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the animal health industry focused on the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of medicines vaccines diagnostic products and services biodevices genetic tests and precision animal health technology for 70 years we have been innovating ways to predict prevent detect and treat animal illness and continue to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide  from livestock farmers to veterinarians and pet owners 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments the united states us and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animals and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 19 segment information  

we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil chile china and mexico we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

we have approximately 300 product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction prevention detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species the diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business for instance in livestock impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other proteins 

a summary of our 2021 performance compared with the comparable 2020 and 2019 periods follows

our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both companion animals and livestock is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics include 

• economic development and related increases in disposable income particularly in many emerging markets 

• increasing pet ownership and pet owners’ commitment to the health and wellbeing of their pets 

• companion animals living longer 

• increasing medical treatment of companion animals and 

• advances in companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics 

38  

the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry fish and sheep livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

• human population growth and increasing standards of living particularly in many emerging markets 

• increasing demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein 

• natural resource constraints such as scarcity of arable land fresh water and increased competition for cultivated land resulting in fewer resources that will be available to meet an increasing demand for animal protein 

• increasing urbanization and 

• increased focus on food safety and food security 

product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations in addition to traditional medicines and vaccines we develop products across additional categories to address the needs of veterinarians and producers to predict prevent detect and treat conditions in both companion animals and livestock including products and services in diagnostics genetics precision animal health and digital and data analytics 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty in addition consumer preferences in some markets have impacted the use of antibacterials in food producing animals such restrictions and consumer preferences in some cases may negatively impact sales of our antibacterial products but in other instances may increase sales of our products that can be used as antibacterial alternatives our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 

similarly concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products however we believe the impact of this trend is limited as the livestock industry is still expected to continue to grow in order to feed a growing global population 

changing distribution channels for companion animal products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians however in the us and certain other markets companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in ecommerce during the covid19 pandemic we believe the ability of pet owners to purchase our products online and from retail stores may increase pet owner compliance and result in increased sales particularly in the near term however over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

in addition this trend could negatively impact the sales of products we primarily sell through the veterinarian distribution channel as any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share and sales of such products a reduction in the number of pet owners who purchase our products directly from their veterinarian could also lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in the past certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care each of these factors plus our broad and innovative portfolio contributes to our ability to incorporate inflationary challenges into our product pricing and mitigate the impact on our results while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy future economic 

39  

challenges including inflation could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health industry which includes medicines vaccines and diagnostics we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also many startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future we also compete with companies that produce generic products following our products’ loss of exclusivity in a given market for example draxxin currently competes with generic products in key markets including the us europe canada mexico and australia for more information regarding the generic competition we currently have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire see item 1 business – intellectual property  

weather conditions climate change and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore weather conditions including excessive cold or heat natural disasters and other events could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed as well as disrupting their normal operations for example livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth climate change or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions climatechange related impacts or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

adverse weather conditions natural disasters and climate change may also impact the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain waterborne diseases 

uncertainty relating to covid19 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the resulting global recession on all aspects of our business across geographies including how it has and may continue to impact our customers workforce suppliers and vendors although we are unable to fully predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic will ultimately have on our future financial position and operating results we continue to monitor the potential effects including impacts on our supply chain the effect on customer demand and changes to our operations we cannot predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our customers vendors and suppliers however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our workforce customers vendors suppliers and other stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities 

for further information regarding the impact of covid19 on the company see item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products have in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

in 2021 we experienced isolated supply challenges for librela solensia and some of our other products resulting from strong demand as well as competition for manufacturing inputs with human health vaccine development during the pandemic some of these challenges are expected to continue in 2022 but are being managed by our global manufacturing network through certain supply chain optimizations controlled launches for new products in additional markets and customer coordination 

40  

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 44 of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan euro and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 56 of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear total revenue growth was favorably impacted by 1 from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

our growth strategies

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— 

note 9 financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

• for sales returns we perform calculations in each market that incorporate the following as appropriate local returns policies and practices returns as a percentage of revenue an understanding of the reasons for past returns estimated shelf life by product an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns product recalls discontinuation of products or a changing competitive environment and 

• for revenue incentives we use our historical experience with similar incentives programs to estimate the impact of such programs on revenue 

if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used for example restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product and 

42  

• a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset this could result for example from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth or from the lack of acceptance of a product by customers 

for finitelived identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology rights and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 88 million as of december 31 2021 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment in 2021 and 2020 we performed a periodic quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

nongaap financial measures 

we report information in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management also measures performance using nongaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies we present certain identified nongaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

operational growth 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a periodtoperiod comparison we believe this nongaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors but should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported growth 

adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share eps are nongaap financial measures of performance used by management we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our us gaap financial measures we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations and the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items 

we recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps see the adjusted net income section below for more information

analysis of the consolidated statements of income 

the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated statements of income should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

 calculation not meaningful 

a amortization expense related to finitelived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell manufacture research market and distribute products compounds and intellectual property is included in amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions amortization expense related to finitelived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in cost of sales  selling general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses  as appropriate 

revenue 

total revenue by operating segment was as follows 

on a global basis the mix of revenue between companion animal and livestock products was as follows 

2021 vs 2020 

total revenue increased by 1101 million or 16 in 2021 compared with 2020 reflecting operational revenue growth of 1002 million or 15 operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following 

• volume growth from inline products including key dermatology products of approximately 9 

• volume growth from new products of approximately 5 and 

• price growth of approximately 1 

foreign exchange increased our reported revenue growth by approximately 1 

45  

costs and expenses 

cost of sales 

2021 vs 2020 

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from 31 to 30 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily as a result of 

• favorable product mix 

• lower inventory obsolescence scrap and other charges 

• favorable foreign exchange and 

• price increases 

partially offset by 

• higher freight and import costs and 

• unfavorable manufacturing and other costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

2021 vs 2020 

sga expenses increased 275 million or 16 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily as a result of 

• an increase in certain compensationrelated costs 

• an increase in investments to support revenue growth 

• higher freight and logistics costs 

• higher charitable contributions and 

• unfavorable foreign exchange 

partially offset by 

• the reduced impact of purchase accounting adjustments and certain significant items 

research and development expenses 

2021 vs 2020 

rd expenses increased 45 million or 10 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily as a result of 

• an increase in certain compensationrelated costs to support innovation 

• increased spending driven by project investments and 

• unfavorable foreign exchange 

amortization of intangible assets 

2021 vs 2020 

amortization of intangible assets increased 1 million or 1 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily as a result of certain intangible assets acquired during 2021 and 2020 

46  

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs 

2021 vs 2020 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs increased by 18 million in 2021 compared with 2020 restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs in 2021 primarily consisted of employee termination costs associated with the realignment of our international operations and other costs associated with costreduction and productivity initiatives asset impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing sites in china and integration costs related to recent acquisitions restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs in 2020 consisted of integration costs related to acquisitions restructuring charges related to ceo transitionrelated costs and employee termination costs related to other costreduction and productivity initiatives 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated costs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 6 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions costreduction and productivity initiatives  

interest expense net of capitalized interest 

2021 vs 2020 

interest expense net of capitalized interest decreased by 7 million or 3 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily as a result of the redemption of 500 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in october 2020 as well as the redemption of our 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 2018 floating rate senior notes and the 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 2018 senior notes in august 2021 partially offset by the issuance of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in may 2020 and lower gains on crosscurrency interest rate swaps as compared to the prior year 

other incomedeductions—net 

 calculation not meaningful 

2021 vs 2020 

the change in other incomedeductions—net is primarily as a result of a net gain in 2020 related to a cash payment received pursuant to an agreement related to the 2016 sale of a certain us manufacturing site as well as higher foreign currency losses and lower interest income in the current year partially offset by an impairment of an equity investment in the prior year 

provision for taxes on income 

the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

2021 vs 2020 

the higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily due to the following components 

• changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items in addition 2021 includes a tax benefit related to foreignderived intangible income 

• a 6 million and 19 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to changes in various other tax items 

• a 7 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the integration of acquired businesses 

• a 1 million discrete tax expense and a 4 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in statutory tax rates and 

• a 24 million and 29 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments 

partially offset by 

• a 5 million discrete tax expense recorded in 2020 related to changes in valuation allowances and 

47  

• an 8 million and 4 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities 

operating segment results 

beginning in the first quarter of 2021 certain costs associated with information technology that specifically support our global manufacturing operations which were previously reported in other unallocated are now reported in corporate in addition in the first quarter of 2021 the company realigned certain management responsibilities these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments these changes primarily include the following i certain diagnostics costs which were previously reported in corporate are now reported in our us results and ii certain other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in our us results are now reported in corporate 

in 2020 the company realigned certain management responsibilities these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments these changes primarily include the following i rd costs related to our aquaculture business which were previously reported in our international commercial segment are now reported in other business activities ii certain other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in international commercial segment results are now reported in corporate and iii certain diagnostics and other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in our us results are now reported in corporate 

certain reclassifications of prior year information have been made to conform to the current years presentation 

on a global basis the mix of revenue between companion animal and livestock products was as follows 

earnings by segment and the operational and foreign exchange changes versus the comparable prior year period were as follows 

 calculation not meaningful 

48  

2021 vs 2020 

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased by 485 million or 14 in 2021 compared with 2020 of which 599 million resulted from growth in companion animal products offset by a 114 million decline in livestock products 

• companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of parasiticides including simparica trio as well as the proheart and revolutionstronghold franchises inline product growth benefited from increased sales of our key dermatology portfolio vaccines and diagnostics products 

• livestock revenue declined due to cattle poultry and swine cattle product sales declined as a result of increased generic competition and challenges in the beef and dairy endmarkets due to rising input costs the poultry portfolio declined as a result of the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and smaller flock sizes reducing disease pressure as well as generic competition the decline in swine product sales was primarily due to pricing pressures on our antiinfective and vaccine portfolio and a nonrecurring government purchase in the prior year 

us segment earnings increased by 330 million or 15 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth partially offset by higher operating expenses 

international operating segment 

international segment revenue increased by 617 million or 20 in 2021 compared with 2020 operational revenue growth was 519 million or 17 reflecting growth of 383 million in companion animal products and 136 million in livestock products 

• companion animal operational revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of our parasiticide products including the simparicasimparica trio and revolutionstronghold franchises also contributing to growth were our key dermatology portfolio vaccine products the recent launches of our mab therapies librela and solensia and diagnostics products growth across the broader inline portfolio benefited from increased pet ownership and standards of care 

• livestock operational revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales in cattle swine and fish growth in cattle product sales was mainly due to the effect of marketing campaigns key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in brazil and favorable conditions in other emerging markets sales of swine products grew as a result of expanding pork production in the wake of african swine fever in china in the first half of the year fish growth was due to an increase in sales of the alpha flux sea lice treatment product an increase in vaccine sales in key salmon markets and the 2020 acquisition of fish vet group 

• additionally international segment revenue was favorably impacted by foreign exchange which increased revenue by approximately 98 million or 3 primarily driven by the euro chinese yuan australian dollar and canadian dollar partially offset by the brazilian real and argentinian peso 

international segment earnings increased by 401 million or 26 in 2021 compared with 2020 operational earnings growth was 324 million or 21 primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth partially offset by higher operating expenses 

other business activities 

other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances us regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products other rdrelated costs associated with nonus market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment 

2021 vs 2020 

other business activities net loss increased by 34 million or 9 in 2021 compared with 2020 reflecting an increase in rd costs due to an increase in compensationrelated costs an increase in project investments and unfavorable foreign exchange 

reconciling items 

reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results such as costs associated with the following

• other unallocated  which includes i certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments ii certain costs associated with finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations iii certain supply chain and global logistics costs and iv certain procurement costs 

2021 vs 2020 

corporate expenses increased by 173 million or 20 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to increases in certain compensationrelated costs investments in information technology charitable contributions and unfavorable foreign exchange lower interest income was offset by lower interest expense 

49  

other unallocated expenses increased by 31 million or 11 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher manufacturing costs higher freight charges and unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence scrap and other charges

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us additionally we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

• senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis 

• our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis and 

• other goal setting and performance measurements 

purchase accounting adjustments 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis acquired in july 2018 the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 king animal health acquired in 2011 fort dodge animal health acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items 

adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation costs related to our ceo transition in fiscal 2020 or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

reconciliation 

a reconciliation of net income attributable to zoetis as reported under us gaap to adjusted net income follows 

 calculation not meaningful 

a the effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is 186 183 and 182 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the higher effective tax rate for 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily attributable to i changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which includes the impact of the location of earnings repatriation costs operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items in addition 2021 includes a tax benefit related to foreignderived intangible income ii a 7 million and 20 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to changes in other tax items iii a 24 million and 29 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments and iv a 1 million discrete tax expense and a 3 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in statutory tax rates partially offset by an 8 million and 4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities 

the higher effective tax rate for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily attributable to i changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which includes the impact of the location of earnings repatriation costs operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items ii an 18 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to changes in valuation allowances and iii a 4 million and 10 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities partially offset by i a 20 million and 4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to changes in other tax items and ii a 29 million and 20 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments

for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents  shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt net of discount and issuance costs  see “analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources” below 

accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts increased primarily as a result of higher net sales in the period and the timing of customer payments partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and rebate credits issued to customers 

inventories increased primarily as a result of the buildup of certain products for increased demand and new product launches partially offset by higher sales than anticipated for certain products see notes to consolidated financial statements  note 11 inventories 

other current assets increased primarily due to the marktomarket adjustment of derivative instruments and higher prepaid expenses partially offset by the timing of income tax payments

the net changes in noncurrent deferred tax assets noncurrent deferred tax liabilities income taxes payable and other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision the timing of income tax payments the tax impact of various acquisitions the impact of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in tax rates 

other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to the marktomarket adjustment of derivative instruments the reclassification of fica payroll taxes to be paid in 2022 under the cares act to accrued compensation and related items and decreases in accrued pension benefits and deferred compensation related to net investment activity

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position while we do not anticipate it there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 

a accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days  for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding have remained within this range we regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging historical and expected collection patterns the financial condition of our customers the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment 

for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multiyear 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility in december 2018 the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 3501 upon entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001 and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501 in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2021 or december 31 2020 

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2021 we had access to 63 million of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2022 and are generally renewed annually we had no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2021 and 4 million borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2020 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the us the amount of funds held in the us will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us and local income taxes such as us state income taxes local withholding taxes and taxes on currency gains and losses see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 8 tax matters  

global economic conditions 

challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

55  

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future these obligations include longterm debt including interest obligations purchase obligations operating lease commitments other liabilities benefit plan obligations and uncertain tax positions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments  note 18 commitments and contingencies note 10 leases  note 6 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions costreduction and productivity initiatives note 14 benefit plans and note 8 tax matters for further information on material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan euro and british pound we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

we use crosscurrency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries these crosscurrency swap contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from certain of our foreign operations 

our crosscurrency swap contracts at december 31 2021 were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against all other currencies by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment cta within accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our net investment hedge would increase or decrease by approximately 86 million the change in value recorded to cta would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments  b derivative financial instruments  

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations but are not designated as hedges 

our forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2021 were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease or increase by 2 million the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income deductionsnet  see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments b derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are predominantly fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our commercial paper and revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations additionally as of december 31 2021 because we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 3900 senior notes due 2028 and our 200 senior notes due 2030 a portion of the fixedrate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on libor or sofr at december 31 2021 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility 

by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor and sofr changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of income an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 if libor or sofrbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 3 million as it relates to our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments  

in anticipation of issuing fixedrate debt we may use forwardstarting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact expected future issuances of debt a 100basis point change in libor or sofrbased interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps by 47 million and 53 million respectively at december 31 2021 

at december 31 2021 our cash equivalents were primarily invested in money market funds interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate

operating segments 

the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

• economic differences such as standards of living in developed markets as compared to emerging markets 

• cultural differences such as dietary preferences for different animal proteins pet ownership preferences and pet care standards 

• epidemiological differences such as the prevalence of certain bacterial and viral strains and disease dynamics 

• treatment differences such as utilization of different types of medicines and vaccines as well as the pace of adoption of new technologies 

• environmental differences such as seasonality climate and the availability of arable land and fresh water and 

• regulatory differences such as standards for product approval and manufacturing 

as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments 

• united states us with revenue of 3557 million or 53 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and 

• international with revenue of 3035 million or 46 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020

products 

over the course of our history we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products that deliver solutions across the continuum of care we refer to all different brands of a particular product or its dosage forms for all species as a product line we have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines including products for both companion animals and livestock within each of our major product categories 

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer deepening the humananimal bond receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics companion animal products represented approximately 55 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to allow veterinarians and producers to care for their animals and to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive demand for improved nutrition particularly through increased consumption of animal protein second population growth leads to greater natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve and the global food chain faces increased scrutiny there is more focus on food quality safety and reliability of supply livestock products represented approximately 44 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

in addition our css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health products together represented approximately 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

our major product categories are 

• vaccines  biological preparations that help prevent diseases of the respiratory gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts or induce a specific immune response 

• antiinfectives  products that prevent kill or slow the growth of bacteria fungi or protozoa

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 29 sites 

7  

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 



we own the majority of these sites with the exception of our facilities in buellton california us durham north carolina us klofta norway london canada medolla italy melbourne australia san diego california us tullamore ireland union city california us and weibern austria which are leased sites 

we are currently in the process of building a second manufacturing site in suzhou china 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2020 this network was comprised of 144 cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic companies such as boehringer ingelheim animal health inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco animal health which includes their recent acquisition of bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag and idexx laboratories there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the us unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business for more information regarding the generic competition we have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire see item 1 business  intellectual property  in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

8  

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 6100 granted patents and 1450 pending patent applications filed in more than 50 countries with a focus on our major markets including australia brazil canada china europe japan and the us as well as other countries with strong patent systems many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our inhouse research and development while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to zoetis

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or those who currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2020 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

• environmentalrelated capital expenditures  approximately 4 million and 

• other environmentalrelated expenditures  approximately 18 million 

however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we currently have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy has disrupted our and our customers suppliers and vendors operations has significantly affected our business and operations and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

the spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns of nonessential businesses while some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions other jurisdictions have seen increases in new covid19 cases resulting in restrictions being reinstated or new restrictions being imposed 

even though we are currently designated as an essential business and have continued physical operations with respect to manufacturing and supply chain globally these measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations the operations and workforce of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to continue to perform critical functions could be harmed 

there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures in particular we and the contract manufacturing organizations cmos we work with could be asked or ordered to perform certain activities for human health that would divert significant manufacturing and other resources away from our business and could expose us to additional liability future restrictions on our access to or control over our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations on our vendors or suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures or export bans could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

17  

the covid19 pandemic also has and may continue to reduce demand for our products as a result of the negative impact it has had and may continue to have on our livestock and companion animal customers our livestock customers have been and may continue to be challenged by voluntary or mandatory facility closures reduced packing plant capacity travel bans and quarantines inhibiting consumption of protein and transportation of live animals and labor shortages negatively impacting their operations for example a number of significant meat processing plants were closed temporarily during the covid19 pandemic after employees tested positive for covid19 in addition our companion animal customers’ businesses in certain geographies have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by reduced demand for their veterinary services the resulting reduction in demand for our products has negatively impacted our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows if such demand reduction accelerates or is prolonged 

moreover while our research and development organization has continued to operate as an essential business future measures imposed by governments and other authorities to try to contain the covid19 pandemic could impede the ability of our rd organization to complete clinical studies required to register new products in the manner and on the timeline we anticipate and current and future product approvals may be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic uncertainty and has led to continued disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which could increase the cost of capital and adversely impact access to capital the economic impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in a global recession that may continue for an unknown period of time in order to preserve liquidity we issued debt securities in may 2020 and we may incur additional indebtedness whether through the issuance of debt securities drawdowns under our credit facility or otherwise in the future an increase in our outstanding indebtedness will result in additional interest expense we may also seek to conserve cash by reducing or canceling future dividends or delaying capital expenditures risks related to negative economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions below 

additionally many of our workforce continue to work remotely as a result of the pandemic remote working arrangements could increase operational risks including but not limited to risks associated with information technology and systems including service interruptions misappropriation of data or breaches of security any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business working outside of the typical work environment may also introduce additional complexity or inefficiency into our normal processes for key areas like the preparation of financial statements or marketing and sales which could negatively impact our business in addition actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic including as part of the reopening process may also result in legal claims or litigation against us 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic but we anticipate that the covid19 pandemic is likely to continue to impact our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in 2021 the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this risk factors section any of which could have a material effect on us this situation continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

our products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to our products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety quality or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products 

if any of our top products experience issues such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation new or unexpected side effects manufacturing disruptions regulatory proceedings labeling changes negative publicity changes to veterinarian or customer preferences andor disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products our revenues could be negatively impacted perhaps significantly our top five products apoquel the simparica product line the revolutionrevolution plusstronghold product line draxxin and the ceftiofur product line contributed approximately 31 of our revenue in 2020 any issues with these top products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations 

generic and other products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products that no longer have patent protection in certain circumstances we have been forced to lower our prices and provide discounts or rebates in order to compete with generic products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result of generic and other competition sales of our rimadyl chewable product in the us 

18  

have declined by approximately 23 in the years since their introduction sales of our clavamox products in the us also continue to be negatively impacted by generic competition 

although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health in certain markets the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics such as channel expansion customer consolidation an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

some of our products patents have expired and over the next few years additional products patents will expire as described below draxxin revolutionrevolution plusstronghold and the ceftiofur product line contributed approximately 15 of our revenue in 2020 

• draxxin containing the active ingredient tulathromycin is covered by a formulation patent in the us that expired in february 2021 corresponding formulation patents in europe canada australia and other key markets expired in late 2020 with the exception of the formulation patents in brazil and japan that both expire in 2025 the active ingredient tulathromycin is protected in brazil until 2022 and in japan until 2023 generic tulathromycin products are now marketed in key markets including europe canada mexico and australia as well as in many smaller markets additional marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products may be granted in various markets in the future market entry of generic tulathromycin products in the us is expected in 2021

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies there are also several startup companies working in the animal health area we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry which could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have 

19  

seen consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in ecommerce during the covid19 pandemic companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we primarily market our companion animal products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the us in the past and may be proposed in the us or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

in the us and certain other markets these and other competitive conditions have increased and may continue to increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities divesting businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties separating businesses or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns adverse customer reaction and potential loss of key employees or customers our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient 

while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or fines resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities inadequate controls or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target’s legacy products 

any of these events could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

acquiring or implementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may acquire or implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business for example we have recently expanded our diagnostics business with additional pointofcare offerings and reference labs we are also investing in genetics and precision livestock farming digital technology and data analytics and insurance agency services there may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts we may invest significant time and resources in developing marketing or acquiring new lines of business andor offering new products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business andor the offering of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable our lack of experience or knowledge as well as external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 

20  

new business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services other risks include i potential diversion of management’s attention available cash and other resources from our existing businesses ii unanticipated liabilities or contingencies iii the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into or acquire the new line of business iv potential damage to existing customer relationships lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers and v the inability to compete effectively failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 

for example regulations regarding antibiotic usage in animals have been introduced in certain markets including the us the eu china france germany and vietnam in addition certain jurisdictions like italy have implemented the use of electronic prescriptions which has caused more disciplined use of antibiotics and decreased the demand for our products 

in certain markets there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated environmental or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore changing consumer preferences and increasing consumer interest in alternatives to animalbased protein and dairy products has driven the growth of plantbased substitutes any resulting reduced demand for animalbased foods could adversely affect the livestock industry and as a result reduce demand for our livestock products which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet moreover customers may seek lower price alternatives to our products if they are negatively impacted by poor economic conditions infectious disease outbreaks pandemics and widespread fear of spreading disease through human contact can cause disruptions to or negatively impact our our customers’ and our distributors’ business operations which could materially adversely affect our operating results furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

21  

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including african swine fever avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions natural disasters and the availability of natural resources 

weather conditions including excessive cold or heat natural disasters and other events could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed such events can also interfere with our livestock customers’ operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things for example severe droughts can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business 

furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of a natural disaster adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience natural disasters including floods fires earthquakes and hurricanes or other storms or prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather 

adverse weather events and natural disasters may also interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites research and development facilities and office buildings which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition especially if such interruptions to regular operations are frequent or prolonged 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are also affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

climate change could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers’ businesses 

we operate in many regions countries and communities around the world where our businesses and the activities of our customers could be disrupted by climate change potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall prolonged droughts or flooding increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters rising sea levels and a rising heat index any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers’ businesses increased temperatures and rising water levels may negatively impact our livestock customers by increasing the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals in addition changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species and trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases the physical changes caused by climate change may also prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers’ businesses climate change may negatively impact our customers’ operations particularly those in the livestock industry through climaterelated impacts such as increased air and water temperatures rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock if such events affect our customers’ businesses they may purchase fewer zoetis products and our revenues may be negatively impacted climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business and on our customers 

moreover there has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future in the us there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be enacted at the federal level to address the effects of climate change such regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and taxes climate change regulation continues to evolve and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation 

modification of foreign trade policy by the us or foreign countries or the imposition of tariffs on us or foreign goods may harm our business 

changes in us laws agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results a number of our customers particularly usbased 

22  

livestock producers benefit from free trade agreements the us canada and mexico reached an agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta with the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca which became effective on july 1 2020 but it remains to be seen what the ultimate impact of the new usmca will be on our customers the new provisions of the usmca as well a s any other changes to international trade agreements or policies could harm our customers and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in response to us tariffs affecting foreign exports some foreign governments including china have instituted and may in the future institute tariffs on certain us goods while the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain tariffs imposed by the us or foreign governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the us as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers cmos or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations or harm our business 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel our executive officers and other key personnel are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2020 we had goodwill of 27 billion and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of 17 billion identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to 

23  

research develop and register products if we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

new product rd leverages discoveries of agribusiness pharmaceutical and biotechnology rd we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to molecules compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access these technologies to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

we may experience difficulties or delays in the development manufacturing and commercialization of new products 

new products may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market within the expected or optimal timeframe or at all in addition product extensions or additional indications may not be approved developing and commercializing new products subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties including i delayed or denied regulatory approvals ii delays or challenges with producing products in accordance with regulatory requirements on a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost iii failure to accurately predict the market for new products and iv efficacy and safety concerns in addition a failure to continue to identify and develop products both internally and through external sources could impact our future success once necessary regulatory approvals are obtained the commercial success of any new product depends upon among other things its acceptance by veterinarians and end customers and on our ability to successfully manufacture market and distribute products in sufficient quantities to meet actual demand for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets the inability to successfully bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations 

the evaluation of our existing and new medicines and vaccines for animals is required in order to develop and commercialize them animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2020 we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 29 manufacturing sites located in 13 countries we also employ a network of 144 thirdparty cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

• the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers including logistical service providers to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines including any changes to good manufacturing practices gmp 

• mislabeling 

• construction delays 

• equipment malfunctions 

• shortages of materials 

• labor problems including any covidrelated impacts 

• delays in receiving any required governmental authorizations including as a result of any prolonged shutdown of the us government 

• natural disasters 

• power outages 

• criminal and terrorist activities 

• changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in types of products produced shipping distributions or physical limitations and 

• the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near our production sites 

these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets in addition the 

24  

regulatory agency in russia no longer accepts gmp certificates issued by outside authorities and instead requires countryspecific gmp certification based on local gmp rules as a result we have ongoing programs at the relevant manufacturing sites to satisfy the russiaspecific gmp requirements our failure to achieve these necessary certifications on a timely basis or at all could impact our ability to sell our products in russia 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors including any impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products result in product delivery delays or shortages and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants 

as part of our supply network strategy we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants we are currently investing in a new plant in suzhou china for the research and production of vaccines in china in addition certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and require licensure by various regulatory authorities significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company’s return on investment 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure or the failure of third parties we rely on including cmos to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals we have changed and may in the future change the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and because of these changes we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process including any delays resulting from covid19 or any prolonged shutdown of the us government or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in 

25  

legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the us attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially we also sell certain nutritional and diagnostic products used in human health that could increase the scope of our liability 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims and other liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved in addition certain of our products could be misused or abused by humans which could expose us to liability for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

laws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions in addition engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks including risks specific to antibribery regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended or the fcpa the uk bribery act 2010 and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time we have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions and sell products in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or that any businesses that we may acquire have complied with such regulations and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example in december 2020 we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to ofac and the us department of justice regarding certain transactions involving sales of food medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to iran potentially in violation of the iranian transactions and sanctions regulations itsr administered by ofac the sales were made by our platinum performance business which we acquired in august 2019 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to 

26  

obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to adequately protect our stakeholders privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee supplier and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer privacy act ccpa and the health insurance portability and accountability act could result in lost sales remediation costs and legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm for example the eu’s gdpr requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue the gdpr requirements apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including employee information we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio and as a result we possess and process an increasing amount of data which could increase the risk of our potential exposure 

additionally the exit by the uk from the european union or brexit took effect in january 2020 which will lead to further legislative and regulatory changes while the data protection act of 2018 that “implements” and complements the gdpr achieved royal assent on may 23 2018 and is now effective in the uk it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the eea to the uk will remain lawful in the long term under gdpr with the expiration of the transition period on december 31 2020 companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into uk national law which has the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover the relationship between the uk and the european union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction which exposes us to further compliance risk we may incur liabilities expenses costs and other operational losses under gdpr and applicable eu member states and the uk privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them 

despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure personal customer and supplier data stored on our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

• volatility in the international financial markets 

• compliance with governmental controls 

• difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights 

• theft or compromise of technology data and intellectual property 

• parallel trade in our products importation of our products from european union countries where our products are sold at lower prices into european union countries where the products are sold at higher prices 

• compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations such as the fcpa and similar nonus laws and regulations 

27  

• compliance with foreign labor laws 

• burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations including those relating to environmental health and safety requirements 

• changes in laws regulations government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers including the imposition of limits on our profitability 

• political and social instability including crime civil disturbance terrorist activities and armed conflicts 

• trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities including restrictions administered by ofac and the european union in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers eg restrictions on the importation of agricultural products from the european union to russia 

• government limitations on foreign ownership 

• government takeover or nationalization of business 

• changes in tax laws and tariffs 

• imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions 

• costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing managing and monitoring international operations including the use of overseas thirdparty goods and service providers 

• corruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities 

• longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk and 

• additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information 

in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union and on january 31 2020 the uk exited the eu commonly referred to as brexit on december 24 2020 the uk and eu reached a postbrexit trade and cooperation agreement that contains new rules governing the new relationship between the uk and the eu including with respect to trade travel and immigration among other things brexitrelated impacts on our business could include disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu increased legal and regulatory complexities higher costs of conducting business in europe potential inventory shortages in the uk increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with ukspecific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the uk any further changes in international trade tariff and importexport regulations as a result of brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other nontariff barriers on us it is also possible that brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees particularly those from the eu the uks vote to exit the eu could also result in similar referendums or votes in other eu member countries in which we do business any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2020 we generated approximately 42 of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar and uk pound we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

28  

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations 

in addition certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from us laws and regulations are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and timeconsuming and requires significant resources in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to investigation costs potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 

for all these and other reasons doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example on october 12 2020 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd published a package of reports known as the blueprints which provide technical details about a twopillar approach to address the tax challenges of the digital economy pillar one would amend profit allocation and nexus rules to grant more taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the physical presence of the business pillar two introduces common global minimum tax rules across the countries participating in the oecd inclusive framework such rules would operate through topup taxes and other measures if a multinational group’s income is not subject to a sufficient level of tax in particular jurisdictions these two proposals combined may represent a significant change in the international tax regime these proposals require unanimous consent and are currently in a “public comment” period there is risk of an adverse impact to our effective tax rate as a result of these proposals but the amount of such impact remains uncertain at this time 

with a new administration elected in the 2020 us presidential and congressional elections the enactment of comprehensive tax reform may be likely which may have an adverse impact to our effective tax rate at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us our distributors or licensors or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

• pay monetary damages 

• obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or 

• stop activities including any commercial activities relating to the affected products which could include a recall of the affected products andor a cessation of sales in the future 

the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action moreover even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing thirdparty patent we may choose to license such patent which would result in associated costs and obligations we may also incur costs in 

29  

connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor licensor or other third party the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all our currently pending and granted patents may be challenged in post grant review inter partes review or opposition or revocation proceedings in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the valid scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in patent law and practice in the us and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions continue to influence changes to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas patent law reforms and new case law could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to adequately patent our products 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

30  

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems and digital solutions make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack in addition we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio and as a result there could be an increased likelihood of a cyberattack or breach of security that could negatively impact us or our customers cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we or our third party partners may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets intellectual property and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions 

like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems networks or infrastructure they may be able to access steal publish delete misappropriate modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data moreover additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data a network disruption including one resulting from a cyberattack could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access theft publishing deletion misappropriation or modification to or of confidential data due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access 

the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant among others such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures litigation regulatory investigations fines and sanctions lost revenues from business interruption damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs as a result a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the us and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

31  

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 725 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we currently have agreements for a multiyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures business development or other general corporate requirements including dividends 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may in the future be at variable rates of interest 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other less leveraged competitors 

• impacting our effective tax rate and 

• increasing our cost of borrowing 

in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we also have outstanding floating rate notes due 2021 2021 floating rate notes that have their interest rate calculated quarterly using threemonth libor in addition we hold certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our senior notes due 2028 so that a portion of the interest payable on these notes is effectively variable based on libor  the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 and supervisory guidance has encouraged banks to stop using libor in new financial contracts as soon as practical and in any event by the end of 2021 it continues to appear likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 or at the latest by june 2023 for certain us dollar libor tenors in addition the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities although there have been certain issuances utilizing sofr it is unknown whether this or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for libor the discontinuance or modification of libor the introduction of alternative reference rates or other reforms to libor could cause the interest rate calculated on our 2021 floating rate notes and the interest rate swap agreements associated with our senior notes due 2028 to be materially different than expected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our 

32  

ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and sp global ratings a division of sp global inc we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes however we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our thenexisting debt instruments will not allow such repurchases our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2020 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 17664 on november 5 2020 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2020 annual report are 

• our operating performance and the performance of our competitors

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 9 2020 our board of directors declared the 2021 first quarter dividend of 025 per share to be paid on march 1 2021 to holders of record on january 20 2021 and on february 10 2021 our board of directors declared the 2021 second quarter dividend of 025 per share to be paid on june 1 2021 to holders of record on april 21 2021 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the us impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

• a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms 

• rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings 

34  

• the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to act by written consent and 

• limitations on the right of stockholders to call for special meetings 

in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the animal health industry focused on the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of medicines vaccines diagnostic products biodevices genetic tests and precision livestock farming technology for more than 65 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments the united states us and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animals and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 19 segment information  

we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil chile china and mexico we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

our products include over 300 products and product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction prevention detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species the diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business for instance in livestock impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other proteins 

a summary of our 2020 performance compared with the comparable 2019 and 2018 periods follows

our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both companion animals and livestock is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics include 

• economic development and related increases in disposable income particularly in many emerging markets 

• increasing pet ownership 

• companion animals living longer 

• increasing medical treatment of companion animals and 

• advances in companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics 

39  

the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry fish and sheep livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

• human population growth and increasing standards of living particularly in many emerging markets 

• increasing demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein 

• natural resource constraints such as scarcity of arable land fresh water and increased competition for cultivated land resulting in fewer resources that will be available to meet an increasing demand for animal protein 

• increasing urbanization and 

• increased focus on food safety and food security 

product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations in addition to traditional medicines and vaccines we develop products across additional categories to address the needs of veterinarians and producers to predict prevent detect and treat conditions in both companion animals and livestock including products in diagnostics genetics precision livestock farming and digital and data analytics 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty in addition consumer preferences in some markets have impacted the use of antibacterials in food producing animals such restrictions and consumer preferences in some cases may negatively impact sales of our antibacterial products but in other instances may increase sales of our products that can be used as antibacterial alternatives our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 

similarly concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products however we believe the impact of this trend is limited as the livestock industry is still expected to continue to grow in order to feed a growing global population 

changing distribution channels for companion animal products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians however in the us and certain other markets companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in ecommerce during the covid19 pandemic we believe the ability of pet owners to purchase our products online and from retail stores may increase pet owner compliance and result in increased sales particularly in the near term however over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

in addition this trend could negatively impact the sales of products we primarily sell through the veterinarian distribution channel as any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share and sales of such products a reduction in the number of pet owners who purchase our products directly from their veterinarian could also lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in the past certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy future economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our 

40  

customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also several startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future we also compete with companies that produce generic products following our products’ loss of exclusivity in a given market for example draxxin currently competes with generic products in key markets including europe canada mexico and australia and we expect generic competition in the us in 2021 for more information regarding the generic competition we currently have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire see item 1 business – intellectual property  

weather conditions climate change and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore weather conditions including excessive cold or heat natural disasters and other events could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed as well as disrupting their normal operations for example livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth climate change or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions climatechange related impacts or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

adverse weather conditions natural disasters and climate change may also impact the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases 

uncertainty relating to covid19 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the resulting global recession on all aspects of our business across geographies including how it has and may continue to impact our customers workforce suppliers and vendors we are currently designated an essential business globally and have continued physical operations with respect to research and development manufacturing and our supply chain as the pandemic continues to progress the severity of the impact across markets remains uncertain as the number of cases rises and falls in various jurisdictions leading to changes in the imposition of restrictive measures intended to contain the virus 

due to numerous uncertainties regarding the continuing covid19 pandemic we are unable to fully predict the impact that it will ultimately have on our future financial position and operating results these uncertainties include the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and number of recurrences the effectiveness of measures to contain and treat the virus including the timing of widespread vaccinations governmental business or other actions in response to the pandemic which could include actions that result in limitations on or disruptions to our manufacturing transportation and other operations or mandates to provide products or services impacts on our supply chain the effect on customer demand or changes to our operations we cannot predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our customers vendors and suppliers however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us in particular our livestock customers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by facility closures reduced packing plant capacity quarantines travel bans and labor shortages and the shift in protein production from foodservice to grocery among other impacts in addition our companion animal customers have been and may in the future be negatively impacted by lack of demand for veterinary services in areas where lockdown and stayathome orders are in place the impact of covid19 on our customers has reduced and could continue to reduce the demand for our products which could continue to adversely impact our revenue the health of our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our manufacturing operations and other critical functions also cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations further the impacts of a prolonged global recession and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown in addition in order to preserve liquidity we issued debt securities in may 2020 and we may in the future incur additional indebtedness whether through the issuance of debt securities drawdowns under our credit facility or otherwise an increase in our outstanding indebtedness will result in additional interest expense 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our workforce customers vendors suppliers and other stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may ultimately have on our business including the effects on our customers workforce and prospects or on our financial results in fiscal 2021 

41  

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 42 of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar uk pound and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 58 of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear total revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 2 from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— 

note 9 financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

• for sales returns we perform calculations in each market that incorporate the following as appropriate local returns policies and practices returns as a percentage of revenue an understanding of the reasons for past returns estimated shelf life by product an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns product recalls discontinuation of products or a changing competitive environment and 

• for revenue incentives we use our historical experience with similar incentives programs to estimate the impact of such programs on revenue 

if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used for example restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product and 

• a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset this could result for example from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth or from the lack of acceptance of a product by customers 

for finitelived identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology rights and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 88 million as of december 31 2020 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory 

44  

forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2020 we performed a periodic quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2020 which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

in 2019 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2019 which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

nongaap financial measures 

we report information in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management also measures performance using nongaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies we present certain identified nongaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

operational growth 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a periodtoperiod comparison we believe this nongaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors but should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported growth 

adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share eps are nongaap financial measures of performance used by management we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our us gaap financial measures we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations and the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items 

we recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps see the adjusted net income section below for more information

analysis of the consolidated statements of income 

the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated statements of income should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 



 calculation not meaningful 

a amortization expense related to finitelived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell manufacture research market and distribute products compounds and intellectual property is included in amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions amortization expense related to finitelived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in cost of sales  selling general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses  as appropriate 

revenue 

total revenue by operating segment was as follows 



on a global basis the mix of revenue between companion animal and livestock products was as follows 



2020 vs 2019 

total revenue increased by 415 million or 7 in 2020 compared with 2019 reflecting operational revenue growth of 546 million or 9 operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following 

• volume growth from new products of approximately 3 

• volume growth from inline products including key dermatology products of approximately 3 

• price growth of approximately 2 and 

• recent acquisitions which contributed approximately 1 

46  

costs and expenses 

cost of sales 



2020 vs 2019 

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from 32 to 31 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of 

• a change in estimate related to inventory costing in 2019 

• favorable product mix 

• price increases and 

• favorable manufacturing costs 

partially offset by 

• higher inventory obsolescence scrap and other charges including costs related to the covid19 pandemic 

• unfavorable foreign exchange and 

• the inclusion of recent acquisitions 

selling general and administrative expenses   



2020 vs 2019 

sga expenses increased 88 million or 5 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of 

• investments to support revenue growth 

• expenses related to recent acquisitions 

• an increase in depreciation 

• freight and logistics and 

• certain compensationrelated costs 

partially offset by 

• lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of decreases in travel and events related to the covid19 pandemic and 

• favorable foreign exchange 

research and development expenses   



2020 vs 2019 

rd expenses increased 6 million or 1 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of 

• an increase in certain compensationrelated expenses and 

• increased spending driven by project investments 

partially offset by 

• lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of decreases in travel and events related to the covid19 pandemic and 

• favorable foreign exchange 

47  

amortization of intangible assets   



2020 vs 2019 

amortization of intangible assets increased 5 million or 3 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of certain intangible assets acquired during 2020 and 2019 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs 



our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of net restructuring charges are related to termination costs our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated costs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 6 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions costreduction and productivity initiatives  

2020 vs 2019 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs decreased by 26 million in 2020 compared with 2019 restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs in 2020 consisted of integration costs related to recent acquisitions restructuring charges related to ceo transitionrelated costs and employee termination costs related to other costreduction and productivity initiatives restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs in 2019 included integration costs and employee termination costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of abaxis in the third quarter of 2018 

interest expense net of capitalized interest 



2020 vs 2019 

interest expense net of capitalized interest increased by 8 million or 4 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of the issuance of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in may 2020 partially offset by the redemption of 500 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in october 2020 and an increase in capitalized interest in 2020 compared with 2019 

other incomedeductions—net   



 calculation not meaningful 

2020 vs 2019 

the change in other incomedeductions—net from net other deductions of 17 million in 2020 compared with net other income of 57 million in 2019 is primarily as a result of 

• asset impairment charges related to developed technology rights in our precision livestock farming and aquatic health businesses 

• lower interest income due to lower interest rates as compared to the prior year period 

• higher foreign currency losses 

• an impairment of an equity investment and 

• other asset impairment charges 

provision for taxes on income 



the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

48  

2020 vs 2019 

the higher effective tax rate in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily due to the following components 

• changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items 

• a 5 million discrete tax expense and an 18 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to changes in valuation allowances 

• a 14 million net discrete deferred tax benefit recorded in 2019 due to a change in tax basis related to purchase accounting 

• a 4 million and 10 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities and 

• a 4 million and 8 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to a remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of changes in statutory tax rates 

partially offset by 

• a 29 million and 20 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments 

• a 19 million and 12 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to changes in various other tax items and 

• a 7 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 related to a remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the integration of acquired businesses 

operating segment results 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange 

in 2020 the company realigned certain management responsibilities these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments these changes primarily include the following i rd costs related to our aquaculture business which were previously reported in our international commercial segment are now reported in other business activities ii certain other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in international commercial segment results are now reported in corporate and iii certain diagnostics and other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in our us results are now reported in corporate 

on a global basis the mix of revenue between companion animal and livestock products was as follows 



49  

earnings by segment and the operational and foreign exchange changes versus the comparable prior year period were as follows 



 calculation not meaningful 

2020 vs 2019 

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased by 354 million or 11 in 2020 compared with 2019 of which 407 million resulted from growth in companion animal products offset by a 53 million decline in livestock products 

• companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of parasiticides including simparica trio our new triple combination parasiticide the key dermatology portfolio and recent acquisitions of platinum performance and a number of regional diagnostic reference labs 

• livestock revenue decreased due to disruptions in the food supply chain attributable to the negative impact of covid19 including reduced producer processing capacity and continued channel migration from dining out to athome consumption that impacted producer profitability the negative impact resulted in a decline across each of the cattle swine and poultry portfolios the decline in the cattle portfolio was also the result of continued unfavorable market conditions in beef and dairy while swine was also impacted by export restrictions on the use of certain products in our portfolio that limited our customers’ access to global markets 

us segment earnings increased by 234 million or 12 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth partially offset by higher operating expenses for investments to support revenue growth 

international operating segment 

international segment revenue increased by 63 million or 2 in 2020 compared with 2019 operational revenue increased 194 million or 7 reflecting growth of 134 million in companion animal products and 60 million in livestock products 

• companion animal operational revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of our parasiticide products including the simparica franchise with the launch of simparica trio in the eu canada and australia as well as the revolutionrevolution plusstronghold franchise key dermatology products also contributed to growth with increased sales of apoquel and cytopoint 

• livestock operational revenue growth was driven by increased sales in swine and fish while cattle and poultry declined sales of swine products grew as a result of expanding herd production and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of african swine fever in china alpha flux a recently launched parasiticide that controls sea lice in salmon increased market share and the recent acquisition of fish vet group were the primary drivers of growth in fish sales of cattle products declined due to decreased demand attributable to the impact of covid19 in certain markets as well as the discontinuation of noncore products in brazil poultry declined due to the negative impacts of covid19 on poultry consumption 

• additionally international segment revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange which decreased revenue by approximately 130 million or 5 primarily driven by the depreciation of the brazilian real argentine peso mexican peso and turkish lira 

international segment earnings increased by 60 million or 4 in 2020 compared with 2019 operational earnings growth was 136 million or 9 primarily due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses partially offset by higher cost of sales 

other business activities 

other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances us regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products other rdrelated costs associated with nonus market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment 

50  

2020 vs 2019 

other business activities net loss increased by 24 million or 7 in 2020 compared with 2019 reflecting an increase in rd costs due to an increase in compensationrelated costs and in project investments partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of decreases in travel and events related to the covid19 pandemic and favorable foreign exchange 

reconciling items 

reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results such as costs associated with the following 

• corporate which includes certain costs associated with business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development and communications among others these costs also include certain compensation costs certain procurement costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments as well as interest income and expense 

• certain transactions and events such as i purchase accounting adjustments  which includes expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory intangible assets and property plant and equipment ii acquisitionrelated activities  which includes costs for acquisition and integration and iii certain significant items  which includes nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charges certain asset impairment charges standup costs certain legal and commercial settlements and costs associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives and 

• other unallocated  which includes i certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments ii certain costs associated with business technology and finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations iii certain supply chain and global logistics costs and iv certain procurement costs 

2020 vs 2019 

corporate expenses increased by 113 million or 16 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to depreciation and recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in certain compensationrelated costs and favorable foreign exchange 

other unallocated expenses increased by 47 million or 16 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence and other charges and unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us additionally we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

• senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis 

• our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis and 

• other goal setting and performance measurements 

purchase accounting adjustments 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis acquired in july 2018 the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

51  

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items 

adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be considered as certain significant items would be a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation costs related to our recent ceo transition or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items 

reconciliation 

a reconciliation of net income attributable to zoetis as reported under us gaap to adjusted net income follows 



 calculation not meaningful 

a the effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is 183 182 and 188 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the higher effective tax rate for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily attributable to i changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which includes the impact of the location of earnings repatriation costs operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items ii an 18 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to changes in valuation allowances and iii a 4 million and 10 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities partially offset by i a 20 million and 4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to changes in other tax items and ii a 29 million and 20 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments 

the lower effective rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to i changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings which reflects the impact of the location of earnings repatriation costs operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of nondeductible and nontaxable items ii an 18 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the changes in valuation allowances iii a 10 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities iv a 4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to changes in various other tax items and v an additional 5 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the excess tax benefits for sharebased payments partially offset by the impact of the gilti tax a new provision to the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective for the company in the first quarter of 2019

operating activities 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2126 million in 2020 compared with 1795 million in 2019 the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher cash earnings and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business partially offset by higher inventory and higher interest payments

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 



a accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days  for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding have remained within this range we regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging historical and expected collection patterns the financial condition of our customers the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment 

for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multiyear 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility in december 2018 the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 3501 upon entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001 and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda any operational efficiency restructuring charge defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1 2016 and ending december 31 2019 related to operational efficiency initiatives provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed 100 million in the aggregate 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501 in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2020 we had access to 79 million of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2021 and are generally renewed annually we had 4 million borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2020 and no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2019 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the us the amount of funds held in the us will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us and local income taxes such as us state income taxes local withholding taxes and taxes on currency gains and losses in addition the changes imposed by the tax act resulted in a onetime deemed repatriation tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries in 2018 which is payable over eight years with the first installment paid in 2019 see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 8 tax matters  

56  

global economic conditions 

challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future

the table above excludes amounts for potential milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years andor which may never occur our contractual obligations in the table above are not necessarily indicative of our contractual obligations in the future

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan euro and british pound we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instrument holdings at december 31 2020 were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2020 indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by 4 million and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would change by an insignificant amount for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9c financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are predominantly fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our 300 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 floating rate senior notes due 2021 as well as interest on our commercial paper and revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations additionally as of december 31 2020 because we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 3900 senior notes due 2028 so that a portion of the fixedrate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on libor at december 31 2020 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility 

by issuing the floatingrate notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of income an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2020 if liborbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 45 million as it relates to our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly through increased consumption of animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food quality and safety livestock products represented approximately 49 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics companion animal products represented approximately 50 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  

in addition our css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health products together represented approximately 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  

in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company modified the list of major product categories to include a category for dermatology products which was previously included within other pharmaceutical products the prior period presentation has been revised to reflect the new product categories 

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenue is derived from other nonpharmaceutical product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in smaller but fast growing areas including biodevices genetic tests and precision livestock farming 

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical biopharmaceutical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  naxcel ® and spectramast ®  

the following are examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in recent years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation listed alphabetically

canada in 2018 as well as in brazil and mexico in 2019 this is the only vaccine to contain two pcv2 genotypes and longlasting m hyo coverage 

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the us and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the us the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the us and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the h3n2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the us in 2019 zoetis established a research facility with texas am university to develop vaccines for transboundary and emerging diseases in animals including footandmouth disease fmd a virus that can cause serious illness in cattle pigs and sheep additionally the pharmaq business of zoetis is the global leader in vaccines and innovation for health products in aquatic health in 2019 pharmaq added to its leading alpha ject ® vaccine line with approval of alpha ject micro 1 tila in brazil and colombia and alpha ject micro 1 si in honduras these vaccines help protect against viruses that affect the tilapia industry in latin america pharmaq also launched alpha flux ® in chile a new parasiticide that helps salmon farmers control sea lice infestations one of the major challenges in the aquatic health industry 

zoetis enhanced the portfolio of its diagnostic products with the acquisition in 2018 of abaxis inc abaxis a leading provider of veterinary pointofcare diagnostic instruments with this acquisition came the vetscan ® portfolio of benchtop and handheld diagnostic instruments and consumables which serves a large customer base of veterinary practices in north america and is poised for expansion in international markets in 2019 the company acquired phoenix central laboratory for veternarians inc phoenix lab and znlabs llc znlabs marking its entry into reference laboratory services and building on a strategy to develop a more comprehensive diagnostics offering with enhanced value for veterinarians our diagnostic portfolio also includes the witness ®  serelisa ® and proflok ® lines of immunodiagnostic kits which provide disease detection capabilities for various species including dogs cats cattle pigs and poultry 

zoetis also entered the field of animal nutritionals with the acquisition of platinum performance in 2019 the acquisition brings us premium nutritional product formulas and a unique approach to the field of scientific wellness for horses dogs and cats 

in 2019  our top two selling products apoquel ® and draxxin ®  contributed approximately 9 and 6  respectively of our revenue and combined with our next three top selling products revolution ®  stronghold ®  the ceftiofur line and simparica ®  these five products contributed approximately 29 of our revenue in 2019 top ten product lines contributed 41 of our revenue

we regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies such as new devices some of our external partnerships involve funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for as well as investment in such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 1100 employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in weibern austria louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil suzhou china farum denmark olot spain union city california kalamazoo michigan durham north carolina and lincoln nebraska us we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in sydney australia zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china navi mumbai india oslo norway hong ngu vietnam and thanh binh vietnam each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents as appropriate 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 27 sites 

7  

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 we own the majority of these sites with the exception of our facilities in buellton california us durham north carolina us klofta norway london canada medolla italy melbourne australia san diego california us union city california us and weibern austria which are leased sites 

we also have a leased site in tullamore ireland that we acquired in 2017 where we plan to begin commercial production in the near term in addition we are currently investing in a manufacturing facility in rathdrum ireland that we acquired in 2017 and in building a second manufacturing site in suzhou china both of these sites are owned by us but are not yet ready for commercial production 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2019  this network was comprised of 147 cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites as a result of a review of our global manufacturing and supply network we have exited 8 manufacturing sites since 2015 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic companies such as boehringer ingelheim animal health inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco animal health idexx laboratories and bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag there are also several midsize competitors and new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the us unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

8  

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 6000 granted patents and 1550 pending patent applications filed in more than 50 countries with a focus on our major markets including australia brazil canada china europe japan and the us as well as other countries with strong patent systems many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our inhouse research and development while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to zoetis 

patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained below is a summary of our recent and upcoming key patent expirations 

 zoetis typically enforces its patents vigorously as appropriate both within and outside the us including by filing infringement claims against other parties 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

following our separation from pfizer pfizer licenses to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a perpetual license to use certain of pfizers product name trademarks 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 7900 trademark applications and registrations in our market countries identifying products and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we currently have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this 2019 annual report any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline 

this report contains “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements reflect our current views with respect to among other things future events and performance we generally identify forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “could” “expect” “intend” “project” “plan” “predict” “believe” “seek” “continue” “outlook” objective target “may” “might” “will” “should” “can have” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance actions or events forwardlooking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information these statements are not guarantees of future performance actions or events 

in particular forwardlooking statements include statements relating to our 2020 financial guidance future actions business plans or prospects prospective products product approvals or products under development product supply disruptions rd costs timing and likelihood of success future operating or financial performance future results of current and anticipated products and services strategies sales efforts expenses production efficiencies production margins anticipated timing of generic market entries integration of acquired businesses interest rates tax rates changes in tax regimes and laws foreign exchange rates growth in emerging markets the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings plans related to share repurchases and dividends government regulation and financial results forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and potentially inaccurate assumptions however there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if managements underlying beliefs and assumptions prove to be incorrect actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forwardlooking statement you should not put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports and our other filings with the sec we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

risks related to our business and industry 

our products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to our products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety quality or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products 

if any of our top products experience issues such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation new or unexpected side effects manufacturing disruptions regulatory proceedings labeling changes negative publicity changes to veterinarian or customer preferences andor disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products our revenues could be negatively impacted perhaps significantly our top five products apoquel draxxin the ceftiofur product line the revolutionstronghold line and simparica contributed approximately 29 of our revenue in 2019 any issues with these top products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations 

generic and other products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products that no longer have patent protection in certain circumstances we have been forced to lower our prices and provide discounts or rebates in order to compete with generic products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result of generic and other competition sales of our rimadyl chewable product in the us have declined by approximately 24 in the years since their introduction sales of our clavamox products in the us also continue to be negatively impacted by generic competition 

15  

although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health in certain markets the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics such as channel expansion customer consolidation an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

over the next few years several of our products patents will expire draxxin containing the active ingredient tulathromycin is covered by formulation patents in the us europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between november 2020 and february 2021 in the us europe canada and australia the active ingredient tulathromycin is protected in japan until 2023 generic tulathromycin products are marketed in certain countries including colombia vietnam belarus russia poland and croatia marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products have been granted in europe and australia there are pending marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products in australia and additional authorizations may be granted in various markets in the future at this time market entry by generic tulathromycin products in the us is not anticipated before february 2021 several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the us in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 a generic version of excede has entered the market in mexico at this time the market entry of a generic version of excede in the us is not anticipated before 2024 the compound patent for selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticides revolution and stronghold expired in 2014 formulation patents covering these products expired in important markets in 2019 generic versions of selamectin are now marketed in markets including europe australia and canada a generic version of selamectin received marketing approval in the us in november 2019 draxxin revolutionstronghold and the ceftiofur product line contributed approximately 16 of our revenue in 2019 in addition the patent for the active ingredient of convenia ® has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and october 2023 the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between may 2020 and january 2027 a generic version of cerenia has been registered in europe and is marketed in the european union and there is a pending registration in canada at this time there is no indication of market entry of a generic version of cerenia in the us there are pending registrations for generic versions of proheart 12 in australia the formulation patent covering proheart 12 expired in the us in 2019 but expires in australia canada and japan in october 2021 zoetis typically enforces its patents whenever appropriate both within and outside the us including by filing infringement claims against other parties 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities further consolidation in the animal health industry could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have seen consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

16  

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we primarily market our companion animal products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the us in the past and may be proposed in the us or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

in the us and certain other markets these and other competitive conditions have increased and may continue to increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient 

while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or fines resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities inadequate controls or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target’s legacy products for example in february 2020 we submitted an initial voluntary disclosure to the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac regarding certain transactions that could potentially have involved sales of food medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to iran the sales were made by our platinum performance business which we acquired in august 2019 while it is unknown at this time whether violation of us sanctions laws occurred our internal investigation is continuing and we have committed to providing a full report of our findings and any additional transactions with any sanctioned or prohibited persons 

to ofac when completed 

any of these events could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

acquiring or implementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may acquire or implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business for example with our july 2018 acquisition of abaxis we added new products and services to our existing pointofcare veterinary diagnostics business and with our recent acquisitions of phoenix lab and znlabs we entered into the reference lab market we are also investing in genetics and precision livestock farming digital technology and data analytics and insurance agency services there may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts we may invest significant time and resources in developing marketing or acquiring new lines of business andor offering new products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business andor the offering of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable our lack of experience or knowledge as well as external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service new business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services other risks include i potential diversion of management’s attention available cash and other resources 

17  

from our existing businesses ii unanticipated liabilities or contingencies iii the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into or acquire the new line of business iv potential damage to existing customer relationships lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers and v the inability to compete effectively failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  

for example regulations regarding antibiotic usage in animals have been introduced in certain markets including the us the eu china france germany and vietnam in addition certain jurisdictions like italy have implemented the use of electronic prescriptions which has caused more disciplined use of antibiotics and decreased the demand for our products 

in certain markets there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated environmental or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore changing consumer preferences and increasing consumer interest in alternatives to animalbased protein and dairy products has driven the growth of plantbased substitutes any resulting reduced demand for animalbased foods could adversely affect the livestock industry and as a result reduce demand for our livestock products which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet infectious disease outbreaks pandemics and widespread fear of spreading disease through human contact can cause disruptions to or negatively impact our our customers’ and our distributors’ business operations which could materially adversely affect our operating results furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition 

18  

outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including african swine fever avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions natural disasters climate change and the availability of natural resources 

weather conditions including excessive cold or heat natural disasters and other events could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed such events can also interfere with our livestock customers’ operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things for example severe droughts can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production in addition the impact of climate change including increased temperatures and rising water levels may negatively affect our livestock customers including by increasing the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals 

adverse weather conditions natural disasters and climate change may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases 

furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth climate change or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of a natural disaster adverse weather conditions climate changerelated impacts or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience natural disasters including floods fires earthquakes and hurricanes or other storms or prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are also affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

modification of foreign trade policy by the us or foreign countries or the imposition of tariffs on us or foreign goods may harm our business 

changes in us laws agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results a number of our customers particularly usbased livestock producers benefit from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta the us canada and mexico reached an agreement to replace nafta with the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca most provisions of the usmca will not begin until all governments ratify the usmca these new provisions as well as any other changes to international trade agreements or policies could harm our customers and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in response to us tariffs affecting foreign exports some foreign governments including china have instituted and may in the future institute tariffs on certain us goods while the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain tariffs imposed by the us or foreign governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

19  

our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the us as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers cmos or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations or harm our business 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel our executive officers and other key personnel are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

following our recent ceo transition we have made a number of changes to our senior management team such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business including to our relationships with our customers suppliers vendors and employees it may also make it more difficult for us to hire and retain key employees 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2019  we had goodwill of  26 billion and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  19 billion  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products if we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

new product rd leverages discoveries of agribusiness pharmaceutical and biotechnology rd we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to molecules compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access these technologies to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

we may experience difficulties or delays in the development manufacturing and commercialization of new products 

new products may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market within the expected or optimal timeframe or at all in addition product extensions or additional indications may not be approved developing and commercializing new products subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties including i delayed or denied regulatory approvals ii delays or challenges with producing products in 

20  

accordance with regulatory requirements on a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost iii failure to accurately predict the market for new products and iv efficacy and safety concerns in addition a failure to continue to identify and develop products both internally and through external sources could impact our future success once necessary regulatory approvals are obtained the commercial success of any new product depends upon among other things its acceptance by veterinarians and end customers and on our ability to successfully manufacture market and distribute products in sufficient quantities to meet actual demand for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets the inability to successfully bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations 

the evaluation of our existing and new medicines and vaccines for animals is required in order to develop and commercialize them animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2019  we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 27 manufacturing sites located in 13 countries we also employ a network of 147 thirdparty cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets in addition regulatory agencies in russia and turkey will soon no longer accept gmp certificates issued by outside authorities and instead will require countryspecific gmp certification as a result we have been undergoing processes at the relevant manufacturing sites to satisfy their countryspecific gmp requirements our failure to achieve these necessary certifications on a timely basis or at all could impact our ability to sell our products in these markets 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to 

21  

volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products result in product delivery delays or shortages and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants 

as part of our supply network strategy we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants we are currently investing in two new plants one in rathdrum ireland for the production of active ingredients for some of our key products and one in suzhou china for the research and production of vaccines in china in addition certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and will require licensure by various regulatory authorities significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company’s return on investment 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure or the failure of third parties we rely on including cmos to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals we have changed and may in the future change the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and because of these changes we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process including any delays resulting from any prolonged shutdown of the us government or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the us attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially we also sell certain nutritional and diagnostic products used in human health that could increase the scope of our liability 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

22  

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims and other liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved in addition certain of our products could be misused or abused by humans which could expose us to liability for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to adequately protect our stakeholders privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee supplier and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the health insurance portability and accountability act could result in lost sales remediation costs and legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm for example the eu’s gdpr requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue 

23  

despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty over the past few years particularly in the uk and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for several years on march 29 2017 the uk formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon on january 23 2020 the uk government approved the withdrawal agreement bill pursuant to which the uk exited the eu on january 31 2020 subject to a transition period of 11 months that commenced on january 31 2020 for trade and relationship negotiations between the uk and the eu during this transition period the uk is to remain part of the single eu market and its customs union and the free movement of people between the uk and the eu will continue a withdrawal of the uk without a trade agreement in place at the end of such transition period could significantly disrupt 

24  

the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe additional brexitrelated impacts on our business could include potential inventory shortages in the uk increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with ukspecific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the uk the uks vote to exit the eu could also result in similar referendums or votes in other eu member countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and could affect sales or regulation of our products any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2019  we generated approximately 44 of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar and uk pound we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

for example in 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela as a result of our evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela including the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations 

in addition certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from us laws and regulations are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and timeconsuming and requires significant resources in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to investigation costs potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 

for all these and other reasons doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example on october 9 2019 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd published the secretariat proposal for a “unified approach” under pillar one pillar one unified approach the pillar one unified approach represents an effort by the oecd to address the tax challenges of the digital economy the proposal does not ringfence the socalled “digital economy” and instead it seeks to allocate a greater share of taxing rights to the countries where consumers are located regardless of the physical presence of the business in addition on november 8 2019 the oecd published a public consultation document for the global antibase erosion proposal pillar two this proposal introduces common global minimum tax rules across the countries participating in the oecd inclusive framework such rules would operate through topup taxes and other measures if a multinational group’s income is not subject to a sufficient level of tax in particular 

25  

jurisdictions these two proposals combined may represent a significant change in the international tax regime these highlevel proposals which require unanimous consent in its early stages and specific details have yet not been developed the potential impact to our effective tax rate is unknown at this time 

on march 29 2017 the uk formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon on january 23 2020 the uk government approved the withdrawal agreement bill pursuant to which the uk exited the eu on january 31 2020 subject to a transition period of 11 months that commenced on january 31 2020 for trade and relationship negotiations between the uk and the eu at this time the impact of brexit to our effective tax rate remains uncertain 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us our distributors or licensors or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action moreover even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing thirdparty patent we may choose to license such patent which would result in associated costs and obligations we may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor licensor or other third party the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all our currently pending and granted patents may be challenged in inter partes review or opposition proceedings in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the valid scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in patent law and practice in the us and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions continue to influence changes to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas a similar court decision was issued in australia with regard to the patentability of nucleic acids patent law reforms and new case law could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to adequately patent our products 

26  

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we or our third party partners may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets intellectual property and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions 

like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems networks or infrastructure they may be able to access steal publish delete misappropriate modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data moreover additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data a network disruption including one resulting from a cyberattack could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access theft publishing deletion misappropriation or modification to or of confidential data due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access 

the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant among others such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures litigation regulatory investigations fines and sanctions lost revenues from business interruption damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs as a result a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

27  

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the us and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 65 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we currently have agreements for a multiyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we also have outstanding floating rate notes due 2021 the “2021 floating rate notes” that have their interest rate calculated quarterly using threemonth libor the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 the discontinuance or modification of libor the introduction of alternative reference rates or other reforms to libor could cause the interest rate calculated on our 2021 floating rate notes to be materially different than expected in addition if interest rates in general continue to rise our interest expense related to the 2021 floating rate notes will increase 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes however we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our thenexisting debt instruments will not allow such repurchases our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

on may 22 2013 pfizer announced an exchange offer the exchange offer whereby pfizer shareholders could exchange a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock the exchange offer was completed on june 24 2013 resulting in the full separation of zoetis and 

29  

the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through february 1 2020 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 14333 on january 22 2020 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2019 annual report are 

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 11 2019 our board of directors declared the 2020 first quarter dividend of 020 per share to be paid on march 3 2020 to holders of record on january 17 2020 and on february 11 2020 our board of directors declared the 2020 second quarter dividend of 020 per share to be paid on june 1 2020 to holders of record on april 17 2020 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs

cash flows available in the us impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic products with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 65 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments the united states us and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 19 segment information  

we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

our products include over 300 products and product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction prevention detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various livestock and companion animal species the diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business for instance in livestock impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other proteins 

a summary of our 2019 performance compared with the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods follows 





our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry fish and sheep livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 



36  

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics include 

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations in addition to traditional medicines and vaccines we develop products across additional categories to address the needs of veterinarians and producers to predict prevent detect and treat conditions in both livestock and companion animals including products in genetics and precision livestock farming diagnostics and digital and data analytics 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty in addition consumer preferences in some markets have impacted the use of antibacterials in food producing animals such restrictions and consumer preferences in some cases may negatively impact sales of our antibacterial products but in other instances may increase sales of our products that can be used as antibacterial alternatives our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  

similarly concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products however we believe the impact of this trend is limited as the livestock industry is still expected to continue to grow in order to feed a growing global population 

changing distribution channels for companion animal products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians however in the us and certain other markets companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years we believe the ability of pet owners to purchase our products online and from retail stores may increase pet owner compliance and result in increased sales particularly in the near term however over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices 

in addition this trend could negatively impact the sales of products we primarily sell through the veterinarian distribution channel as any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share and sales of such products a reduction in the number of pet owners who purchase our products directly from their veterinarian could also lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in the past certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy future economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

37  

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also several startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the us 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions 

adverse weather conditions may also impact the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 44 of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar uk pound and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 56 of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear total revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 3 from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and across eight major species we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 

38  



components of revenue and costs and expenses 

our revenue costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the us for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

revenue 

our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines vaccines and diagnostic products used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals generally our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists and then sold directly by us or through distributors retailers or ecommerce outlets the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies in 2019  our top two selling products apoquel and draxxin contributed approximately 9 and 6  respectively of our revenue and combined with our next three top selling products revolutionstronghold the ceftiofur line and simparica these five contributed approximately 29 of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 41 of our revenue for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2019  see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and product lifecycle innovation overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as abaxis in 2018 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net consist primarily of various items including net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income foreign exchange translation gainslosses and certain asset impairment charges 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

39  

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— 

note 9 financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  fair value  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 for finitelived identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology rights and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

40  

when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 105 million as of december 31 2019  iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2019  we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2019  which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

in 2018  we performed a quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2018  which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

nongaap financial measures 

we report information in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management also measures performance using nongaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies we present certain identified nongaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

operational growth 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a periodtoperiod comparison we believe this nongaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors but should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported growth 

41  

adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share eps are nongaap financial measures of performance used by management we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our us gaap financial measures we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations and the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items 

we recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps see the adjusted net income section below for more information

 partially offset by 

 amortization of intangible assets   



2019 vs 2018

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs   



 calculation not meaningful 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of net restructuring charges are related to termination costs our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated costs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 6 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions costreduction and productivity initiatives  

2019 vs 2018

interest expense net of capitalized interest 

2019 vs 2018 

interest expense net of capitalized interest increased by 17 million  or 8  in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily as a result of the issuance of 15 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in august 2018 partially offset by gains on crosscurrency interest rate swaps

operating segment results 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange 

in the first quarter of 2018 the company realigned certain management responsibilities these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments these changes primarily include the following i rd costs related to our aquaculture business which were previously reported in other business activities are now reported in the international operating segment results and ii certain other miscellaneous costs which were previously reported in corporate are now reported in the international operating segment results 

on a global basis the mix of revenue between livestock and companion animal products was as follows 



earnings by segment and the operational and foreign exchange changes versus the comparable prior year period were as follows 



 calculation not meaningful 

46  

2019 vs 2018 

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased by 326 million  or 11  in 2019 compared with 2018  of which 376 million resulted from growth in companion animal products offset by a 50 million decline in livestock products 

 us segment earnings increased by 190 million  or 10  in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily due to revenue growth and improved gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses

international segment revenue increased by 82 million  or 3  in 2019 compared with 2018  operational revenue increased 247 million  or 9  reflecting growth of 216 million in companion animal products and 31 million in livestock products 

 international segment earnings increased by 88 million  or 6  in 2019 compared with 2018  operational earnings growth was 143 million  or 10  primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin 

other business activities 

other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances us regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products other rdrelated costs associated with nonus market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment 

2019 vs 2018 

other business activities net loss increased by 11 million  or 3  in 2019 compared with 2018  reflecting an increase in rd project investments compensationrelated costs and the inclusion of abaxis expenses since acquisition in july 2018 partially offset by revenue from the acquired abaxis human health business and more favorable foreign exchange rates in 2019 

reconciling items 

reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results such as costs associated with the following 

 2019 vs 2018 

corporate expenses increased by 41 million  or 6  in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily due to higher interest expense net of capitalized interest associated with the 2018 senior notes issued in august 2018 and an increase in certain compensation costs not allocated to our operating segments partially offset by more favorable foreign exchange rates 

other unallocated expenses decreased by 47 million  or 14  in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network partially offset by tariffs on certain products and the inclusion of abaxis expenses

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us additionally we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 purchase accounting adjustments 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis acquired in july 2018 the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs 

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items 

adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be considered as certain significant items would be a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation costs related to our recent ceo transition or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized

operating activities 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities was  1795 million in 2019 compared with  1790 million in 2018  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher cash earnings partially offset by higher income tax payments higher interest payments and higher inventory as well as the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 



 for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multiyear 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility in december 2018 the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 3501  upon entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001  and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda any operational efficiency restructuring charge defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1 2016 and ending december 31 2019 related to operational efficiency initiatives provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed 100 million in the aggregate 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501 in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2019 or december 31 2018  

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2019  we had access to 76 million of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2020 and are generally renewed annually we had no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2019  

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the us the amount of funds held in the us will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us and local income taxes such as us state income taxes local withholding taxes and taxes on currency gains and losses in addition the recent changes imposed by the tax act resulted in a onetime deemed repatriation tax of previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries which is payable over eight years with the first installment paid in 2019 see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 8 tax matters

global economic conditions 

challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

contractual obligations 

payments due under contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  are set forth below 



 the table above excludes amounts for potential milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years andor which may never occur our contractual obligations in the table above are not necessarily indicative of our contractual obligations in the future

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan euro and uk pound we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instrument holdings at december 31 2019  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2019  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  13 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  17 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9c financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are predominantly fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our 300 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 floating rate senior notes due 2021 as well as interest on our commercial paper and revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations additionally as of december 31 2019  because we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 39 senior notes due 2028 the fixedrate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on libor at december 31 2019  there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility 

by issuing the floatingrate notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of income an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2019  if liborbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 45 million  as it relates to our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments

 item 1 business 

overview 

zoetis inc is a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic products with a focus on both livestock and companion animals we have a diversified business commercializing products across eight  core species cattle swine poultry fish and sheep collectively livestock and dogs cats and horses collectively companion animals and within six  major product categories vaccines antiinfectives parasiticides medicated feed additives animal health diagnostics and other pharmaceutical products for more than 65 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we were incorporated in delaware in july 2012 and prior to that the company was a business unit of pfizer inc pfizer the address of our principal executive offices is 10 sylvan way parsippany new jersey 07054 unless the context requires otherwise references to “zoetis” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018   2018  annual report refer to zoetis inc a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries in addition unless the context requires otherwise references to “pfizer” in this 2018  annual report refer to pfizer inc a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries 

operating segments   

the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

 as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments 

 within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs 

in addition our client supply services css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health diagnostics products together represented approximately 1  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018

our 2018  revenue for the united states and key international markets together with the percentage of revenue attributable to livestock and companion animal products in those markets is as follows 



  

for additional information regarding our performance in each of these operating segments and the impact of foreign exchange rates see item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

notes to consolidated financial statements—note 4 revenue and note 18 segment information our 2018  reported revenue for each segment by species is as follows

products 

over the course of our history we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products including medicines vaccines and diagnostics complemented by biodevices genetic tests and a range of services we refer to a single product in all brands or its dosage forms for all species as a product line we have approximately 300  comprehensive product lines including products for both livestock and companion animals across each of our major product categories 

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food quality and safety livestock products represented approximately 54  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics companion animal products represented approximately 45  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  

in addition our css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and our human health diagnostics products together represented approximately 1  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  

in the third quarter of 2018 the company modified the list of major product categories to include a category for animal health diagnostics which was previously included within other nonpharmaceutical products the prior period presentation has been revised to reflect the new product categories 

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenue is derived from other nonpharmaceutical product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in complementary areas including biodevices and genetic tests 

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  naxcel ®  and spectramast ®  

the following are examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in recent years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation listed alphabetically 



3   

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the united states and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the united states the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the united states and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the h3n2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the united states additionally the pharmaq business of zoetis is the global leader in vaccines and innovation for health products in aquaculture in 2018 pharmaq added to its leading alpha ject ®  vaccine line with approval of alpha ject micro 1 noda vaccine in spain italy croatia and greece this vaccine helps protect against viral nervous necrosis the most important viral disease threatening sea bass in the mediterranean also in 2018 the alpha ject panga 2 vaccine was approved in vietnam this vaccine helps protect against two types of bacteria  edwardsiella ictaluri and  aeromonas hydrophila  that cause significant losses in the vietnamese pangasius industry 

zoetis enhanced the portfolio of its diagnostic products with the acquisition in 2018 of abaxis a leading provider of veterinary pointofcare diagnostic instruments with this acquisition came the vetscan ®  portfolio of benchtop and handheld diagnostic instruments and consumables which serves a large customer base of veterinary practices in north america and is poised for expansion in international markets our diagnostic portfolio also includes the witness ®  serelisa ®  and proflok ®  lines of immunodiagnostic kits which provide disease detection capabilities for various species including dogs cats cattle pigs and poultry 

in 2018  our top two selling products apoquel ®  and draxxin ®  contributed approximately 8  and 6  respectively of our revenue and combined with our next two top selling products the ceftiofur line and revolution ®   stronghold ®  these four contributed approximately 25  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 40  of our revenue

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 45  countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and our products are sold in more than 100  countries operations outside the united states accounted for 50  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico emerging markets contributed 23  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2018  our sales organization consisted of approximately 3100  employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

6   

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that then typically sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 13  and 7  respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  and no other customer represented more than 6  of our revenue for the same period 

research and development 

our research and development rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development registration and regulatory maintenance of our products in addition we have rd operations focused on diagnostics data digital and other technological innovation we incurred rd expense of  432 million  in 2018   382 million  in 2017  and  376 million  in 2016  

our rd efforts are comprised of more than 300 programs and reflect our commitment to develop better solutions we create new insights for preventing and treating disease and maximizing healthy performance that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation leveraging internal discoveries complemented by diverse external research collaborations results in the delivery of novel vaccine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd plays a critical role in our growth strategies a significant share of our rd investment including regulatory functions is focused on product lifecycle innovation a commitment to continuous innovation based on customer need ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries we also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in biodevice diagnostics and genetics research ensuring we can help our customers predict prevent detect and treat a variety of conditions 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend this view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing rd and other industries supports a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process 

we regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies some of our external partnerships involve funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for as well as investment in such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

as of december 31 2018  we employed approximately 1100  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in weibern austria louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil suzhou china farum denmark olot spain union city california kalamazoo michigan durham north carolina and lincoln nebraska united states we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in sydney australia zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china and navi mumbai india we also maintain rd operations in suzhou china thanh binh vietnam hong ngu vietnam and oslo norway related to our acquisition of pharmaq each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents as appropriate 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 25  sites 

7   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 we own the majority of these sites with the exception of our facilities in durham us klofta norway london canada medolla italy melbourne australia san diego california us and union city california us which are leased sites 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2018  this network was comprised of approximately 172  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at three pfizer sites pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we also have a leased site in tullamore ireland that we acquired in 2017 where we plan to begin commercial production in the near term in addition we are currently investing in a manufacturing facility in rathdrum ireland that we acquired in 2017 and in building a second manufacturing site in suzhou china both of these sites are owned by us but are not yet ready for commercial production 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites as a result of a review of our global manufacturing and supply network we have exited eight manufacturing sites since 2015 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic companies such as boehringer ingelheim animal health inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco animal health an independent animal health company as of september 2018 formerly the animal health division of eli lilly and company bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag and idexx laboratories there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

8   

intellectual property

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich vich is a trilateral eujapanusa program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration the objectives of the vich are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 10000  employees worldwide which included approximately 4500  employees in the united states and approximately 5500  in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50  union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2018  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

risks related to our business and industry 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products 

if any of our top products experience issues such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation new or unexpected side effects manufacturing disruptions regulatory proceedings labeling changes negative publicity changes to veterinarian or customer preferences andor disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products our revenues could be negatively impacted perhaps significantly our top four products apoquel draxxin the ceftiofur product line and the revolutionstronghold line contributed approximately 25 of our revenue in 2018 any issues with these top products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations 

generic and other products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result of generic and other competition sales of our rimadyl chewable product in the us have declined by approximately 29 in the years since their introduction sales of our clavamox products in the us also continue to be negatively impacted by generic competition if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

13   

over the next several years several of our products patents will expire the active ingredient of draxxin tulathromycin is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the united states europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between may 2019 and january 2021 in the united states between november 2018 and november 2020 in europe and between may 2018 and november 2020 in canada and australia generic tulathromycin products are marketed in countries such as columbia vietnam belarus and russia recently marketing authorizations were granted in europe and there is a pending marketing authorization in australia at this time market entry by generic versions in the us are not anticipated before january 2021 several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 a generic version of excede has recently entered the swine market in mexico at this time the market entry of a generic version of excede in the us is not anticipated before 2024 the compound patent for selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticides revolution and stronghold expired in 2014 again we have formulation patents covering these products which expire in important markets in 2019 generic versions of selamectin are now authorized in europe australia and south korea the market entry of a generic version of selamectin is not anticipated in the us before november 2019 the ceftiofur product line draxxin and revolutionstronghold contributed approximately 18 of our revenue in 2018 in addition the patent for the active ingredient of convenia ®  has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and october 2023 the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between may 2020 and january 2027 a generic version of cerenia has been registered in europe and is marketed in the european union at this time there is no indication of market entry of a generic version of cerenia in the us zoetis typically enforces its patents whenever appropriate both within and outside the united states including by filing infringement claims against other parties 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities further consolidation in the animal health industry could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have seen consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states in the past and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet 

14   

owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  

for example in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phaseout in the united states over a threeyear period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian the fda indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans as part of those efforts stricter regulations governing the administration of medically important antibiotics are now effective the use of medically important antibiotics in the water or feed of food production animals now requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian under the fda guidance and the related rule known as the veterinary feed directive 

two new veterinary medicines regulations in the eu were adopted in november 2018 and provide additional restrictions on the use of antibiotics in the eu the regulations will be fully implemented by the end of 2021 

in addition other countries such as france germany and vietnam have passed restrictions or bans on antibiotic use 

in certain markets there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship 

15   

with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including african swine fever avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

severe droughts can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production in addition climate change may increase the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals 

adverse weather conditions may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases 

modification of foreign trade policy by the us or foreign countries or the imposition of tariffs on us or foreign goods may harm our business 

changes in us laws agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results a number of our customers particularly usbased livestock producers benefit from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta the us canada and mexico reached an agreement to replace nafta with the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca most provisions of the usmca will not begin until 2020 these new provisions as well as any other changes to international trade agreements or policies could harm our customers and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in response to new us tariffs affecting foreign exports some foreign governments including china have instituted or are considering instituting tariffs on certain us goods while the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain tariffs imposed by the us or foreign governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

16   

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers cmos or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers or other key personnel could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel our executive officers and other key personnel are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2018  we had goodwill of  25 billion  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  20 billion  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products if we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties including pfizer to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such 

17   

organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2018  we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 25  manufacturing sites located in 12  countries we also employ a network of approximately 172  third party cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products result in product delivery delays or shortages and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants 

as part of our supply network strategy we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants we are currently investing in two new plants one in rathdrum ireland for the production of active ingredients for some of our key products and one in suzhou china for the research and production of vaccines in china in addition certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and will require licensure by various regulatory authorities significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company’s return on investment 

18   

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure or the failure of third parties we rely on including cmos to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals we have changed and may in the future change the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and because of these changes we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process including any delays resulting from any prolonged shutdown of the us government   or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

19   

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized 

20   

importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal without a trade agreement in place could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe additional brexitrelated impacts on our business could include potential inventory shortages in the uk increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with ukspecific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the uk the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business on march 29 2017 united kingdom prime minister theresa may formally notified the european council of the uks intention to withdraw from the european union under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon the notice began the twoyear negotiation period to establish the withdrawal terms while no agreement has yet been reached the uks separation will still become effective on march 29 2019 unless the remaining european union members unanimously agree to an extension the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and could affect sales or regulation of our products any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2018  we generated approximately 47  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar and uk pound we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

for example in 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela as a result of our evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela including the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations 

in addition certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from united states laws and regulations are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and timeconsuming and requires significant resources in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to investigation costs potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 

for all these and other reasons doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

21   

for example on june 20 2016 the member states of the european union adopted the antitaxavoidance directive proposed on january 28 2016 which is designed to provide uniform implementation of base erosion and profits shifting measures and other minimum taxation standards across member states the member states are required to implement all components of the directive by january 1 2020 once enacted by the member states the results of the directive could have an impact on our effective tax rate in october 2016 the european union also introduced a proposal to impose a uniform set of rules on taxing corporate profits known as the common consolidated corporate tax base this proposal is still under consideration and may have an impact to our effective tax rate if enacted 

on march 29 2017 united kingdom uk prime minister theresa may formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon the notice began the twoyear negotiation period to establish the withdrawal terms while no agreement has yet been reached the uk’s separation will still become effective on march 29 2019 unless the remaining european union members unanimously agree to an extension at this time the impact of brexit to our effective tax rate remains uncertain 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act effective january 1 2018 some notable provisions of the tax act include a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and a change from a worldwide system with deferral to a territorial tax system which includes a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years on certain undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2018 the cumulative amount of nonus undistributed earnings was approximately 51 billion which includes an allocation of nonus undistributed earnings as a result of the separation from pfizer on june 24 2013 the company evaluated the full impact of this new legislation on its consolidated financial statements and in the fourth quarter of 2017 recorded a provisional net charge of 212 million related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate a measurementperiod adjustment was recorded in 2018 as a decrease to income tax expense of 45 million at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the united states or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us our distributors or licensors or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action moreover even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing thirdparty patent we may choose to license such patent which would result in associated costs and obligations we may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor licensor or other third party the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all our currently pending and granted patents may be challenged in inter partes review or opposition proceedings in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the valid scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties 

22   

regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in patent law and practice in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions continue to influence changes to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas a similar court decision was issued in australia with regard to the patentability of nucleic acids patent law reforms and new case law could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to adequately patent our products 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks   are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we or our third party partners may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets intellectual property and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions 

like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems networks or infrastructure they may be able to access steal publish delete misappropriate modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data moreover additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data a network disruption including one resulting from a cyberattack could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access theft publishing deletion misappropriation or modification to or of confidential data due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access 

the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant among others such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures litigation regulatory investigations fines and sanctions lost revenues from business interruption damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs as a result a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to adequately protect our stakeholders privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

23   

the protection of customer employee supplier and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the health insurance portability and accountability act could result in lost sales remediation costs and legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm   for example the eu’s gdpr became effective on may 25 2018 and requires companies to meet new and enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue   

despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 64 billion  of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we currently have agreements for a multiyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 



24   

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we also have outstanding floating rate notes due 2021 the “2021 floating rate notes” that have their interest rate calculated quarterly using threemonth libor the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 the discontinuance or modification of libor the introduction of alternative reference rates or other reforms to libor could cause the interest rate calculated on our 2021 floating rate notes to be materially different than expected in addition if interest rates in general continue to rise our interest expense related to the 2021 floating rate notes will increase 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes however we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our thenexisting debt instruments will not allow such repurchases our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

25   

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

on may 22 2013 pfizer announced an exchange offer the exchange offer whereby pfizer shareholders could exchange a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock the exchange offer was completed on june 24 2013 resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2018 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 9657 on november 1 2018 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2018  annual report are 



26   

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 12 2018 our board of directors declared the 2019 first quarter dividend of 0164 per share to be paid on march 1 2019 to holders of record on january 18 2019 and on february 12 2019 our board of directors declared the 2019 second quarter dividend of 0164 per share to be paid on june 3 2019 to holders of record on april 18 2019 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and  forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  sections of this mda 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostic products with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 65 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments the united states us and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment information  

we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45  countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

a summary of our 2018  performance compared with the comparable 2017  and 2016  periods follows 





our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry fish and sheep livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines vaccines and diagnostics include 



32   

product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in the past certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy future economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions 

33   

adverse weather conditions may also impact the aquaculture business changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100  countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 47  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro brazilian real chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar uk pound and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 53  of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear total revenue growth did not have a net impact from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 



components of revenue and costs and expenses 

our revenue costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the united states for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

34   

revenue 

our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines vaccines and diagnostic products used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals generally our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists and then sold directly by us or through distributors the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies in 2018  our top two selling products apoquel and draxxin contributed approximately 8  and 6  respectively of our revenue and combined with our next two top selling products the ceftiofur line and revolutionstronghold these four contributed approximately 25  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 40  of our revenue for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2018  see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales  consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga  expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd  expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and product lifecycle innovation overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs  consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as abaxis in 2018 and pharmaq holding as and abbott animal health aah both acquired in 2015 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net  consist primarily of various items including net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income foreign exchange translation gainslosses and certain asset impairment charges 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 



35   

if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 for finitelived identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology rights and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 197 million  as of december 31 2018  iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

36   

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the effective tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2018 we performed a quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30 2018 which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

in 2017 we performed both qualitative and select quantitative impairment assessments as of october 1 2017 which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

nongaap financial measures 

we report information in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management also measures performance using nongaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies we present certain identified nongaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

operational growth 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a periodtoperiod comparison we believe this nongaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors but should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported growth 

adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share eps are nongaap financial measures of performance used by management we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our us gaap financial measures we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations and the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items 

we recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps see the adjusted net income  section below for more information

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs   



 calculation not meaningful 

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments   

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program and a supply network strategy initiative these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over a long term period as part of these initiatives we have reduced certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete and we have exited eight of the ten manufacturing sites as part of the supply network strategy initiative which we expect to complete over the next several years 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs

the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted which among other changes reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code based on the information available at that time for the year ended december 31 2017 the company calculated a reasonable estimate and recorded an initial provisional net tax expense of 212 million related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate pursuant to the staff accounting bulletin published by the securities and exchange commission on december 22 2017 addressing the challenges in accounting for the effects of the tax act in the period of enactment companies reported provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the tax act for which the accounting was incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined those provisional amounts were subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date measurementperiod adjustment pursuant to this guidance the estimated impact of the tax act was based on a preliminary review of the new tax law projected future financial results and was subject to revision based upon further analysis interpretation of the tax act and to the extent that actual results differed from projections available at that time 

in 2018 we refined our initial reasonable estimate and adjusted the provisional net tax expense of 212 million on the basis of revised computations that were calculated during the reporting period we recognized a measurementperiod adjustment of 45 million  as a decrease to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligation with a corresponding adjustment to income tax benefit during the period

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us additionally we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 



46   

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis acquired in july 2018 the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multiyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility in december 2018 the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the 

53   

period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 3501  upon entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001  and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda any operational efficiency restructuring charge defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1 2016 and ending december 31 2019 related to operational efficiency initiatives provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed 100 million  in the aggregate 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501 in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  there were no  amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2018  or december 31 2017

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in the united states will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us and local income taxes such as us state income taxes local withholding taxes and taxes on currency gains and losses in addition the recent changes imposed by the tax act resulted in a onetime deemed repatriation tax of previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries which is payable over eight years with the first installment due in 2019 see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 8 tax matters  

global economic conditions 

challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future

recently issued accounting standards not adopted as of december 31 2018 

in august 2018 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which expands the scope of costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that must be capitalized under the new guidance costs associated with implementing a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract must be capitalized and expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement the provisions of the update are effective beginning january 1 2020 for interim and annual periods with early adoption permitted for any interim period after issuance of the update we are currently assessing the timing of our adoption as well as the potential impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2018 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which permits companies to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the new federal corporate income tax rate in the period of adoption a company may choose to either apply the amendments retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate is recognized or to apply the amendments in that reporting period we will adopt this guidance as of january 1 2019 the required effective date adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern for lessees the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital and operating leases respectively companies may elect to exclude shortterm leases the update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2019 using the effective date as the date of initial application as permitted utilizing an optional transition method a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings will be recognized in the period of adoption and financial information and disclosure for 

56   

periods prior to the date of initial application will not be updated we have substantially completed our implementation of a lease accounting system and our evaluation of lease contracts accounting policy elections and the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements we do not expect the total of right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities recorded in conjunction with adoption to exceed 200 million each adoption of the standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro and uk pound we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instrument holdings at december 31 2018  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2018  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  20 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  24 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9c financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk

operating segments   

the animal health medicines and vaccines market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

 as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments 

 within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs 

in addition our client supply services css organization provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and represented approximately 1  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017

products 

over the course of our history we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products including medicines and vaccines complemented by biodevices diagnostics and genetics we refer to a single product in all brands or its dosage forms for all species as a product line we have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines including products for both livestock and companion animals across each of our major product categories 

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food quality and safety livestock products represented approximately 57  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 42  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

in addition our css organization provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and represented 1  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenue is derived from other product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in complementary areas including biodevices diagnostics and genetics 

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  naxcel ®  and spectramast ®  

examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in recent years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation include listed alphabetically 



3   

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the united states and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the united states the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the united states and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the h3n2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the united states examples also include the first and only vaccine to aid in the prevention of clinical symptoms of the disease caused by hendra virus in horses a serious zoonotic disease identified in australia that can be fatal to horses and people a conditionally licensed vaccine in the united states for use in poultry as an aid in the prevention of avian influenza virus h5n1 the first centrallyauthorized vaccine in the european union to reduce viremia associated with schmallenberg virus infection in cattle and sheep and the first live recombinant marker vaccine in the european union and united states to prevent mortality and reduce infection caused by classical swine fever in pigs additionally the pharmaq business of zoetis is the global leader in vaccines and innovation for health products in aquaculture in 2017 pharmaq added to its leading alpha ject ®  vaccine line with alpha ject ®  micro 1 pd vaccine an efficacious and safe monovalent vaccine against pancreas disease pd the most economically damaging viral disease for the norwegian scottish and irish salmon farming industries proven to be suitable for coinjection with other pharmaq vaccines 

our diverse portfolio also includes diagnostics products such as the witness ®  and serelisa ®  lines of immunodiagnostic kits in 2017 we expanded both product lines with the launch of witness lepto canine in the united states and the launch of witness felv fiv heartworm feline globally we also expanded our serelisa ®  laboratory kit line with serelisa pedv swine for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and serelisa bvdv cattle which provides additional disease detection capabilities for bovine viral diarrhea virus 

in 2017  our top two selling products apoquel ® and the ceftiofur line each contributed approximately 7  of our revenue and combined with our next two top selling products draxxin ® and revolution ®  these four contributed approximately 25  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 39  of our revenue 

4   

our product lines and products that represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2017  which comprise 57  of our total revenue are as follows listed alphabetically 

livestock products 



5   

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and our products are sold in more than 100 countries operations outside the united states accounted for 50  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico emerging markets contributed 23  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to our international operations  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2017  our sales organization consisted of approximately 2900  employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

6   

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that then typically sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 14 and 7 respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  and no other customer represented more than 6 of our revenue for the same period 

research and development 

our research and development rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development registration and regulatory maintenance of our products we incurred rd expense of  382 million  in 2017   376 million  in 2016  and  364 million  in 2015  

our rd efforts are comprised of more than 200 programs and reflect our commitment to develop better solutions we create new insights for preventing and treating disease and maximizing healthy performance that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation leveraging internal discoveries complemented by diverse external research collaborations results in the delivery of novel vaccine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd plays a critical role in our growth strategies a significant share of our rd investment including regulatory functions is focused on product lifecycle innovation a commitment to continuous innovation based on customer need ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries we also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in diagnostics and genetics research ensuring we can help our customers predict prevent detect and treat a variety of conditions 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend this view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing rd and other industries supports a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process 

we regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies some of our external partnerships involve funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for as well as investment in such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 1000  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil olot spain kalamazoo michigan and lincoln nebraska united states we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in sydney australia zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china navi mumbai india and durham north carolina united states we also maintain rd operations in farum denmark suzhou china thanh binh vietnam hong ngu vietnam and oslo norway related to our acquisitions of pharmaq and scandinavian micro biodevices each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 25  sites 

7   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 we own all of these sites with the exception of our facilities in medolla italy melbourne australia san diego california us and tullamore ireland which are leased sites 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at four  pfizer sites pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2017  this network was comprised of approximately 180  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites as a result of a review of our global manufacturing and supply network we have announced plans to exit or sell certain sites and have exited eight manufacturing sites since 2015 including yantai china and guarulhos brazil in 2017 see operational efficiency program and supply network strategy  

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as boehringer ingelheim animal health inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh which acquired merial former animal health division of sanofi sa in january 2017 merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company and bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

8   

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 5200 granted patents and 1700 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with a focus on our major markets including australia brazil canada china europe japan and the united states as well as other countries with strong patent systems many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our inhouse research and development while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to zoetis 

patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the active ingredient of draxxin tulathromycin is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the united states europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between may 2019 and january 2021 in the united states between november 2018 and november 2020 in europe and between may 2018 and november 2020 in canada and australia several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 the compound patent for selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticide revolution expired in 2014 again we have process and formulation patents covering this product which expire in important markets in 2018 and 2019 respectively the patent for the active ingredient of convenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and october 2023 the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between may 2020 and january 2027 the patent relating to the formulation of orbeseal expired in december 2017 zoetis typically enforces all of its patents 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

as a result of our separation from pfizer where necessary pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a perpetual license to use certain of pfizers product name trademarks 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 10000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

operational efficiency program and supply network strategy 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over the long term as of december 31 2017  we divested or exited three  us manufacturing sites four  international manufacturing sites and our 55 percent  ownership share of a taiwan joint venture inclusive of its related manufacturing site we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of these initiatives we planned to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries in 2016 the operations of the guarulhos brazil manufacturing site including approximately 300 employees were transferred to us from pfizer which increased our range of planned reduction in certain positions to 2300 to 2800 including divestitures as of december 31 2017 approximately 2600  positions have been eliminated the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete however in the fourth quarter of 2017 we expanded the supply network strategy initiative which increases our planned reductions in certain positions by 40 we expect these additional reductions related to our supply network strategy to take place over the next twelve months and the remainder of the reductions from the initial plan to take place through divestitures over the next several years 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products 

united states 

united states food and drug administration fda  the regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the united states is the center for veterinary medicine cvm housed within the fda all manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the federal food drug and cosmetic

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

outside the united states 

european union eu the european medicines agency ema is the centralized regulatory agency of the eu located in london the agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by healthcare companies seeking centralized approval for use in the eu the agency has a veterinary review section distinct from the medical review section the committee for veterinary medicinal products cvmp is responsible for scientific and technical review of the submissions for innovative pharmaceuticals biopharmaceuticals and vaccines after the cvmp issues a positive opinion on the approvability of a product the eu commission reviews the opinion and if they agree with the cvmp they grant the product market authorization once granted by the european commission a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all eu and european economic areaeuropean free trade association states products can also be registered in the eu via a decentralized route under the supervision of the coordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures  veterinary cmdv this coordination group is composed of one representative per member state from each national regulatory agency including norway iceland and liechtenstein the cmdv reviews submissions of pharmaceuticals and vaccines for authorization of a veterinary product in two or more member states in accordance with the mutual recognition or the decentralized procedure a series of regulations directives guidelines and eu pharmacopeia monographs provide the requirements for product approval in the eu in general these requirements are similar to those in the united states requiring demonstrated evidence of safety efficacy and qualityconsistency of manufacturing processes 

brazil  the ministry of agriculture livestock production and supply mapa is the regulatory body in brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use mapas regulatory activities are conducted through the secretary of agricultural defense and its livestock products inspection department in addition regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the federal agriculture superintendence these activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products as well as the submission review and approval of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives mapa is one of the most active regulatory agencies in latin america having permanent seats at several international animal health forums such as codex alimentarius world organization for animal health and committee of veterinary medicines for the americas mapa was also invited to be a latin american representative at meetings of the international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich several normative instructions issued by mapa have set regulatory trends in latin america 

australia the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority apvma is an australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the australian marketplace previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration the apvma assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the apvmas scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments if the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people animals the environment or international trade the apvma will register the product as well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products the apvma reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use the apvma also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness the review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used in some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being canceled and the product taken off the market 

rest of world  countryspecific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling safety efficacy and manufacturers quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products as well as company records and reports with the exception of the eu most other countries regulatory agencies will generally refer to the fda usda eu and other international animal health entities including the world organization for animal health codex alimentarius in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2017  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements 

11   

in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this 2017  annual report any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline 

this report contains “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements reflect our current views with respect to among other things future events and performance we generally identify forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “could” “expect” “intend” “project” “plan” “predict” “believe” “seek” “continue” “outlook” objective target “may” “might” “will” “should” “can have” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance actions or events forwardlooking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information these statements are not guarantees of future performance actions or events

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports and our other filings with the sec we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  

12   

for example in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phaseout in the united states over a threeyear period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian the fda indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans as part of those efforts stricter regulations governing the administration of medically important antibiotics have recently come into effect as of january 1 2017 the use of medically important antibiotics in the water or feed of food production animals now requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian under the fda guidance and the related rule known as the veterinary feed directive as a result of the implementation by livestock producers of the fda guidance and the veterinary feed directive we have seen a negative impact on revenue in the us on certain medicated feed additive products for both cattle and swine in 2017 if these regulations continue to negatively affect our us cattle and swine medicated feed additive revenue our future operating results could be negatively impacted 

in addition other countries such as france and vietnam have passed restrictions or bans on antibiotic use 

in certain markets there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have seen recent consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the 

13   

consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the widespread drought that impacted the united states in 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013 droughts such as this one can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products 

if any of our top products experience issues such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation new or unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings labeling changes negative publicity changes to veterinarian or customer preferences andor disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products our revenues could be negatively impacted perhaps significantly our top four products apoquel the ceftiofur product line draxxin and revolution contributed approximately 25 of our revenue in 2017 any issues with these top products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations 

modification of us foreign trade policy may harm our us livestock product customers 

changes in us laws agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results a number of our customers particularly usbased livestock producers benefit from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta the current president of the united states has initiated negotiations with canada and mexico aimed at renegotiating the terms of nafta efforts by the united states to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements to which it is a party could harm our customers and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such 

14   

products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result sales of our rimadyl chewable product in the us have continued to decline decreasing by approximately 8 in 2017 compared to the prior year if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

over the next several years several of our products patents will expire the active ingredient of draxxin tulathromycin is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the united states europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between may 2019 and january 2021 in the united states between november 2018 and november 2020 in europe and between may 2018 and november 2020 in canada and australia several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 the compound patent for selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticide revolution expired in 2014 again we have process and formulation patents covering this product which expire in important markets in 2018 and 2019 respectively the ceftiofur product line draxxin and revolution contributed approximately 18 of our revenue in 2017 in addition the patent for the active ingredient of convenia ®  has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and october 2023 the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between may 2020 and january 2027 a generic version of cerenia has recently been registered in europe and is marketed in the netherlands and france the patent relating to the formulation of orbeseal expired in december 2017 zoetis typically enforces all of its patents 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other 

15   

alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies 

we are pursuing and will continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets operational revenue growth through new product development and valueadded product lifecycle innovation using cash flow from operations to service debt and expanding our complementary products and services we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers or other key personnel could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel our executive officers and other key personnel are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2017  we had goodwill of  15 billion  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  13 billion  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties including pfizer to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

16   

disruptive innovations and advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2017  we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 25  manufacturing sites located in 12  countries we also employ a network of approximately 180  third party cmos including a number owned by pfizer many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site in addition we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

17   

there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants 

as part of our supply network strategy we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants we are currently investing in two new plants one in rathdrum ireland for the production of active ingredients for some of our key products and one in suzhou china for the research and production of vaccines in china these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and will require licensure by various regulatory authorities significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company’s return on investment 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals we have changed and may in the future change the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and because of these changes we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

18   

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws challenges brought against our incentive tax rulings and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 



19   

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business on march 29 2017 the united kingdom prime minister formally notified the european council of the united kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the european union under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon the notice begins the twoyear negotiation period to establish the withdrawal terms if no agreement is reached after two years the united kingdom’s separation still becomes effective unless the remaining european union members unanimously agree to an extension the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and could affect sales or regulation of our products any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

finally there has been recent political instability in catalonia which depending on the outcome could impact our rd and manufacturing operations in olot spain 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2017  we generated approximately 47  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real and canadian dollar we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

in 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million  on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela this loss was recorded as a result of our evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela including the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and the subsequent changes to venezuelas foreign currency exchange mechanisms in addition to our expectation of venezuelas responses to changes in its economy and continued volatility 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations 

in addition certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from united states laws and regulations are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and timeconsuming and requires significant resources in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to investigation costs potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 

20   

for all these and other reasons doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example the european commission opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain european countries including belgium comply with european union rules on state aid in the case of belgium the european commission concluded on january 11 2016 that the excess profits ruling violates the european union’s state aid rules the impact of this conclusion was a net tax charge of approximately 35 million recorded in 2016 this net charge relates to the belgium governments recovery of benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal and without consideration of implementation of any future operational changes and does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision 

in addition on june 20 2016 the member states of the european union adopted the antitaxavoidance directive proposed on january 28 2016 which is designed to provide uniform implementation of base erosion and profits shifting measures and other minimum taxation standards across member states the member states are required to implement all components of the directive by january 1 2020 once enacted by the member states the results of the directive could have an impact on our effective tax rate in october 2016 the european union also introduced a proposal to impose a uniform set of rules on taxing corporate profits known as the common consolidated corporate tax base this proposal is in its early stages but may have an impact to our effective tax rate 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act effective january 1 2018 some notable provisions of the tax act include a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and a change from a worldwide system with deferral to a territorial tax system which includes a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years on certain undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 the cumulative amount of nonus undistributed earnings was approximately 45 billion which includes an allocation of nonus undistributed earnings as a result of the separation from pfizer on june 24 2013 pursuant to the staff accounting bulletin published by the securities and exchange commission on december 22 2017 addressing the challenges in accounting for the effects of the tax act in the period of enactment companies must report provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined those provisional amounts will be subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date the company is currently in the process of evaluating the full impact of this new legislation on its consolidated financial statements and in the fourth quarter of 2017 has recorded a provisional net charge of 212 million related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

on march 29 2017 united kingdom uk prime minister theresa may formally notified the european council of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon the notice begins the twoyear negotiation period to establish the withdrawal terms if no agreement is reached after two years the uk’s separation still becomes effective unless the remaining european union members unanimously agree to an extension at this time the impact of brexit to our effective tax rate is uncertain 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the united states or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not 

21   

obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

patent law reform in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions in the recent years have led to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas a similar court decision in australia was issued recently with regard to the patentability of nucleic acids such reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

22   

assuming we are able to implement new systems successfully all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks   are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions 

like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems networks or infrastructure they may be able to access steal publish delete misappropriate modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data moreover additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data a network disruption including one resulting from a cyberattack could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access theft publishing deletion misappropriation or modification to or of confidential data due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access 

the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant among others such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures litigation fines and sanctions lost revenues from business interruption and damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure as a result a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to adequately protect our stakeholders privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee supplier and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws including the eu general data protection regulation gdpr could result in lost sales remediation costs and legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm   for example the eu’s gdpr becomes effective may 25 2018 and requires companies to meet new and enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue   

despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 50 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we have entered into an agreement 

23   

for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes however we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our thenexisting debt instruments will not allow such repurchases our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

24   

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

on may 22 2013 pfizer announced an exchange offer the exchange offer whereby pfizer shareholders could exchange a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock the exchange offer was completed on june 24 2013 resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2017 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 7358 on december 19 2017 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2017  annual report are 



25   

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 11 2017 our board of directors declared the 2018 first quarter dividend of 0126 per share to be paid on march 1 2018 to holders of record on january 19 2018 and on february 13 2018 our board of directors declared the 2018 second quarter dividend of 0126 per share to be paid on june 1 2018 to holders of record on april 20 2018 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and  forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  sections of this mda 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 60 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments the united states us and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  

we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers additionally our management team’s focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing longterm value for our shareholders 

a summary of our 2017  performance compared with the comparable 2016  and 2015  periods follows 



 calculation not meaningful 



our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry fish and sheep livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 



31   

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals or increased consumer preference for antibioticfree protein 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in recent years certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of recent downturns in the global economy further economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors 

32   

influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 47  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan euro uk pound and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 53  of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear revenue growth was favorably  impacted by 1  from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

in 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million  on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela this loss was recorded as a result of our evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela including the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and the subsequent changes to venezuelas foreign currency exchange mechanisms in addition to our expectation of venezuelas responses to changes in its economy and continued volatility 

operational efficiency program and supply network strategy 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over a long term period as of december 31 2017  we divested or exited three  us manufacturing sites four  international manufacturing sites and our 55 percent ownership share of a taiwan joint venture inclusive of its related manufacturing site we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of these initiatives we planned to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries in 2016 the operations of the guarulhos brazil manufacturing site including approximately 300 employees were transferred to us from pfizer which increased our range of planned reduction in certain positions to 2300 to 2800 including divestitures as of december 31 2017  approximately 2600  positions have been eliminated and the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete however in the fourth quarter of 2017 we expanded the supply network strategy initiative which increases our planned reductions in certain positions by 40 we expect these additional reductions related to our supply network strategy to take place over the next twelve months and the remainder of the reductions from the initial plan to take place through divestitures over the next several years 

for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4b acquisitions and divestitures divestitures and  note 5 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 



33   



components of revenue and costs and expenses 

our revenue costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the united states for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

revenue 

our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals generally our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists and then sold directly by us or through distributors the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies in 2017  our top two selling products apoquel and the ceftiofur line each contributed approximately 7  of our revenue and combined with our next two top selling products draxxin and revolution these four contributed approximately 25  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 39  of our revenue for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2017  see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales  consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga  expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd  expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and product lifecycle innovation overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs  consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as pharmaq holding as and abbott animal health aah both acquired in 2015 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net  consist primarily of various items including net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income foreign exchange translation gainslosses and certain asset impairment charges 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

34   

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies— estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized 

as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment reviews we recorded the following impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable 



35   

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 224 million  as of december 31 2017  iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2017 we performed both qualitative and select quantitative impairment assessments as of october 1 2017 which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units 

in 2016 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of october 2 2016 determined that is it not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount and therefore concluded that a quantitative fair value test was not required 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

 calculation not meaningful 

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments   

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over a long term period as of december 31 2017 we divested or exited three  us manufacturing sites four  international manufacturing sites and our 55 percent ownership share of a taiwan joint venture inclusive of its related manufacturing site we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes as part of these initiatives we planned to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000  to 2500  subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries in 2016 the operations of the guarulhos brazil manufacturing site including approximately 300 employees were transferred to us from pfizer which increased our range of planned reduction in certain positions to 2300 to 2800 including divestitures as of december 31 2017  approximately 2600  positions have been eliminated and the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete however in the fourth quarter of 2017 we expanded the supply network strategy initiative which increases our planned reductions in certain positions by 40 we expect these additional reductions related to our supply network strategy to take place over the next twelve months and the remainder of the reductions from the initial plan to take place through divestitures over the next several years 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs

 provision for taxes on income 



certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted which among other changes reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code and it will take time to fully analyze the impact of the changes based on the information available and the current interpretation of the tax act the company was able to make a reasonable estimate and recorded a provisional tax expense related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate pursuant to the staff accounting bulletin published by the securities and exchange commission on december 22 2017 addressing the challenges in accounting for the effects of the tax act in the period of enactment companies must report provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined those provisional amounts will be subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date pursuant to this guidance the estimated impact of the tax act is

based on a preliminary review of the new law and projected future financial results and is subject to revision based upon further analysis and interpretation of the tax act and to the extent that future results differ from currently available projections 

on january 11 2016 the european commission concluded that the belgium “excess profits tax scheme” constitutes illegal state aid and ordered the belgian authorities to recover benefits from taxpayers who are parties to an excess profits ruling as a result the 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates do not reflect any benefit of the excess profits ruling and does incorporate the belgium governments recovery of benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal and without consideration of implementation of any future operational changes

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

2017 vs 2016 

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased  by 173 million  or 7  in 2017 compared with 2016 of which approximately 17 million  resulted from growth  in livestock products and approximately 156 million  resulted from growth  in companion animal products 



43   

 us segment earnings increased  by 129 million  or 9  in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to revenue growth and improved gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses related to promotional activity for new products and apoquel ®  

international operating segment 

international segment revenue increased  by 253 million  or 11  in 2017 compared with 2016 operational revenue increased   240 million  or 10  reflecting growth of approximately 125 million  in livestock products and growth of approximately 115 million  in companion animal products 

 segment revenue was favorably impacted by foreign exchange which increased revenue by approximately 1 primarily driven by the appreciation of the brazilian real partly offset by the depreciation of the uk pound and egyptian pound 

international segment earnings increased  by 186 million  or 18  in 2017 compared with 2016 operational earnings growth was 183 million  or 17  primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin

 international segment earnings increased  by 113 million  or 12  in 2016 compared with 2015 operational earnings growth was 159 million  or 17  primarily due to higher revenue improved gross margin and lower operating expenses 

other business activities 

other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results as well as expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances us regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products other rdrelated costs associated with nonus market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment

other business activities net loss increased  by 4 million  or 1  in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting the inclusion of the veterinary diagnostics business acquired in 2016 and the irish biologic therapeutics company acquired in 2017 

2016 vs 2015 

other business activities net loss increased  by 16 million  or 5  in 2016 compared with 2015 reflecting an increase in rd spending driven by higher development expenses for latestage projects and the addition of pharmaq rd expenses partially offset by a decrease in rd spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative

reconciling items 

reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results such as costs associated with the following 

 2017 vs 2016 

corporate expenses decreased by 59 million  or 9  in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange a reduction in expenses driven by our operational efficiency initiative and a decrease in certain compensation costs not allocated to our operating segments partially offset by higher interest expense net of capitalized interest associated with the additional debt issued in september 2017 

other unallocated expenses increased by 110 million  or 61  in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher global manufacturing and supply costs and unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by a decrease in inventory obsolescence scrap and other charges

2016 vs 2015 

corporate expenses increased by 78 million  or 13  in 2016  compared with 2015  primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange which includes exposures to certain emerging market currencies and costs related to hedging and higher interest expense net of capitalized interest associated with the additional debt issued in november 2015 partly offset by a decrease in certain compensation costs not charged to our operating segments

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items described below the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored metrics designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

45   

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until realized

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 



 for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets  and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility in december 2017 the maturity for the amended and restated revolving credit agreement was extended through december 2022 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 3501  upon 

52   

entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001  and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda any operational efficiency restructuring charge defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1 2016 and ending december 31 2019 related to operational efficiency initiatives provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed 100 million in the aggregate 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501 in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  there were no  amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2017  or december 31 2016  

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2017  we had access to 75 million  of lines of credit which expire at various times throughout 2017 and 2018 and are generally renewed annually we did not have any borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in the united states will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states no accrual for us taxes is provided see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 8 tax matters  

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

contractual obligations 

payments due under contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  are set forth below 



certain amounts may reflect rounding adjustments 

 the table above excludes amounts for potential milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years andor which may never occur our contractual obligations in the table above are not necessarily indicative of our contractual obligations in the future

new accounting standards 

for discussion of our new accounting standards see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies—new accounting standards  

recently issued accounting standards not adopted as of december 31 2017 

in august 2017 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements and allows for more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting recognition of periodic hedge effectiveness will no longer be required for cash flow and net investment hedges and companies may elect to perform subsequent hedge effectiveness assessments qualitatively the update also clarifies that the change in fair value of a derivative must be recorded in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item and introduces additional disclosure requirements including cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges and the effect of hedging on individual income statement line items the provisions of the update are effective beginning january 1 2019 for interim and annual periods with early adoption permitted for any interim period after issuance of the update we are currently assessing the timing of our adoption as well as the potential impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2017 the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify and improve the reporting of net periodic pension benefit cost by requiring only present service cost to be presented in the same line item as other current employee compensation costs while remaining components of net periodic benefit cost would be presented within other incomedeductions—net  outside of operations we will adopt this guidance as of january 1 2018 the required effective data and do not expect that the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity asset transfer other than inventory when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the asset is sold to an outside third party the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2018 for annual and interim reporting periods we will adopt this guidance as of january 1 2018 the required effective date and do not expect that the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern for lessees the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital and operating leases respectively companies may elect to exclude shortterm leases the update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2019 the required effective date for annual and interim reporting periods the new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers this update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance includes a fivestep model for determining how when and how much revenue should be recognized this update also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we will adopt this guidance as of january 1 2018 the required effective date using the modified retrospective transition method under the modified retrospective method the cumulative effect of applying the new standard will be recognized as of the date of initial application with disclosure of results under both the new and prior standards the new standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption or on an ongoing basis

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instruments at december 31 2017  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2017  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  24 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  32 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9b financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk

operating segments   

the animal health medicines and vaccines market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

 as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments the united states and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs our operating segments are

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food quality and safety livestock products represented approximately 59  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 40  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  rtu excenel ®  rtu ez excenel ®  naxcel ®  and spectramast ®  

examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in recent years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation include listed alphabetically

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that typically then sell the products to livestock producers we 

6   

primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 13 and 7 respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  and no other customer represented more than 4 of our revenue for the same period 

research and development 

our research and development rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development registration and regulatory maintenance of our products we incurred rd expense of  376 million  in 2016   364 million  in 2015  and  396 million  in 2014  

our rd efforts are comprised of more than 200 programs and reflect our commitment to develop better solutions we create new insights for preventing and treating disease and maximizing healthy performance that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation leveraging internal discoveries complemented by diverse external research collaborations results in the delivery of novel vaccine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd plays a critical role in our growth strategies a significant share of our rd investment including regulatory functions is focused on product lifecycle innovation a commitment to continuous innovation based on customer need ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries we also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in diagnostics and genetics research ensuring we can help our customers diagnose predict prevent and treat a variety of conditions 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend this view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing rd and other industries supports a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process 

we regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies some of our external partnerships involve funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for as well as investment in such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 1000  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil olot spain kalamazoo michigan and lincoln nebraska united states we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in sydney australia zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china navi mumbai india and durham north carolina united states since the acquisition of pharmaq in 2015 we maintain rd operations in thanh binh vietnam hong ngu vietnam and oslo norway and for recently acquired scandinavian micro biodevices we operate a facility in farum denmark each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 25  sites 

7   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 we own all of these sites with the exception of our facilities in medolla italy melbourne australia and san diego california us which are leased sites 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at five  pfizer sites pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement 

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2016  this network was comprised of approximately 200  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites we recently conducted a review of our global manufacturing and supply network to improve efficiency and have announced plans to exit or sell certain sites over the last two years we exited our manufacturing sites in haridwar india hsinchu taiwan laurinburg north carolina us longmont colorado us shenzhou china and van buren arkansas us as part of our operational efficiency program and supply network strategy see operational efficiency program and supply network strategy  

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as boehringer ingelheim vetmedica inc the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh which acquired merial former animal health division of sanofi sa in january 2017 merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company and bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

8   

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 4800 granted patents and 1700 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with a focus on our major markets including australia brazil canada china europe japan and the united states as well as other countries with strong patent systems many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our inhouse research and development while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to zoetis 

patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained the active ingredient of draxxin tulathromycin is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the united states europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between may 2019 and january 2021 in the united states between november 2018 and november 2020 in europe and between may 2018 and november 2020 in canada and australia several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 the compound patent for the selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticide revolution expired in 2014 again we have process and formulation patents covering this product which expire in important markets in 2018 and 2019 respectively the patent for the active ingredient of convenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and january 2024 the patent relating to the formulation of orbeseal expires in december 2017 zoetis typically enforces all of its patents 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

as a result of our separation from pfizer where necessary pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a perpetual license to use certain of pfizers product name trademarks 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 10000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

operational efficiency program and supply network strategy 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the supply network strategy that was previously announced these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios changing our selling approach in certain markets and reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over the long term as of december 31 2016 we divested or exited three  us manufacturing sites two  international manufacturing sites and our 55 percent  ownership share of a taiwan joint venture inclusive of its related manufacturing site we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of this initiative we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2016 approximately 1800  positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next six months 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products

brazil  the ministry of agriculture livestock production and supply mapa is the regulatory body in brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use mapas regulatory activities are conducted through the secretary of agricultural defense and its livestock products inspection department in addition regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the federal agriculture superintendence these activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products as well as the submission review and approval of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives mapa is one of the most active regulatory agencies in latin america having permanent seats at several international animal health forums such as codex alimentarius world organization for animal health and committee of veterinary medicines for the americas mapa was also invited to be a latin american representative at meetings of the international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich several normative instructions issued by mapa have set regulatory trends in latin america 

australia the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority apvma is an australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the australian marketplace previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration the apvma assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the apvmas scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments if the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people animals the environment or international trade the apvma will register the product as well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products the apvma reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use the apvma also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness the review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used in some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being canceled and the product taken off the market 

rest of world  countryspecific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling safety efficacy and manufacturers quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products as well as company records and reports with the exception of the eu most other countries regulatory agencies will generally refer to the fda usda eu and other international animal health entities including the world organization for animal health codex alimentarius in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines 

global policy and guidance 

joint faowho expert committee on food additives  the joint faowho expert committee on food additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the world health organization who they provide a risk assessmentsafety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs we work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in foodproducing animals after treatment this in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain 

10   

advertising and promotion review promotion of prescription animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries these rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency we conduct a review of promotion materials for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products 

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich vich is a trilateral eujapanusa program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration the objectives of the vich are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 9000  employees worldwide which included approximately 4000  employees in the united states and approximately 5000  in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50  union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2016  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

11   

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this 2016  annual report any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline 

this report contains “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements reflect our current views with respect to among other things future events and performance we generally identify forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “could” “expect” “intend” “project” “plan” “predict” “believe” “seek” “continue” “outlook” objective target “may” “might” “will” “should” “can have” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance actions or events forwardlooking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information these statements are not guarantees of future performance actions or events

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  

12   

for example in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phaseout in the united states over a threeyear period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian the fda indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans as part of those efforts stricter regulations governing the administration of medically important antibiotics have recently come into effect as of january 1 2017 the use of medically important antibiotics in the water or feed of food production animals now requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian zoetis supports the fdas efforts to voluntarily phase out growth promotion indications for medically important antibiotics in food producing animals and is complying with procedures outlined in the december 2013 fda guidance in addition in october 2014 the french parliament passed a law that prohibits rebates and discounts on antibiotics and requires the reporting of antibiotics sold to and agreements entered into with certain animal healthcare providers including veterinarians veterinary schools pharmacists and students the parliament indicated that the law is in response to a government initiative aimed at fighting antimicrobial resistance in animals and reducing the use of certain categories of antibiotics by 25 compared to 2013 by december 31 2016 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business for example incidences of bse in the united states and brazil in 2012 led certain countries to implement additional inspections of or suspend the importation of us and brazilian beef similarly outbreaks of highly pathogenic h5 avian flu affected infected or exposed 48 million birds in the united states in 2014 and 2015 and significantly impacted the egg and turkey industry the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers and our distributors have seen recent consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

13   

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the widespread drought that impacted the united states in 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013 droughts such as this one can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers for example the economic downturns experienced in many markets across the globe have had an impact on certain of our customers and as a result on our operating results in those affected markets if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

14   

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing or sometimes the date of patent grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtainedthe extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and because of their pricing are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions for example several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result sales of our rimadyl chewable product in the us decreased by approximately 6 in 2016 if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

over the next several years several of our products patents will expire the active ingredient of draxxin tulathromycin is covered by both compound and formulation patents in the united states europe canada australia and other key markets with terms that expire between may 2019 and january 2021 in the united states between november 2018 and november 2020 in europe and between may 2018 and november 2020 in canada and australia several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line excede began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents relevant to the product line extend through to 2024 the compound patent for the selamectin the active ingredient in our parasiticide revolution expired in 2014 again we have process and formulation patents covering this product which expire in important markets in 2018 and 2019 respectively the patent for the active ingredient of convenia has expired however there are formulation patents relevant to the product line which expire between november 2022 and january 2024 the patent relating to the formulation of orbeseal expires in december 2017 zoetis typically enforces all of its patents 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements 

we are pursuing and will continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets operational revenue growth through new product development and valueadded product lifecycle innovation improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt and expanding our complementary products and services we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies including those acquired and those developed internally additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

15   

loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers our executive officers are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may experience difficulties delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our comprehensive operational efficiency initiative 

on may 5 2015 we announced an initiative to simplify our operations improve our efficiency and cost structure and better allocate our resources to key growth opportunities in animal health as part of the initiative we have reduced staff and plan to close or divest certain facilities we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits and savings from our efforts due to unforeseen difficulties the complexity inherent in unwinding our current structure and delays or unexpected costs which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as a result of our operational efficiency initiative we are operating our business initiatives under a new business model and in some instances existing employees have and will be transitioning to new key roles we must also attract retain and motivate key employees who are critical to our business if we are unable to effectively execute this new business model and transition key roles andor attract retain and motivate key employees it may adversely impact our business 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2016  we had goodwill of  1481 million  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  1228 million  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents acquired customer relationships and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical combined financial data for periods prior to the ipo the year ended december 31 2012 and the period ended january 31 2013 included in this 2016  annual report does not reflect the financial condition or results of operations we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily the result of the following factors 

 our financial condition and future results of operations will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial data included in this 2016  annual report for the periods prior to the ipo as a result of the separation from pfizer it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

16   

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties including pfizer to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2016  we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 25  manufacturing sites located in 11  countries as part of our operational efficiency program and supply network strategy we have exited or are in the process of exiting certain of these sites for more information see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— operational efficiency program and supply network strategy  we also employ a network of approximately 200  third party cmos including a number owned by pfizer many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site in addition at the time of launch we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel that impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

17   

as part of our operational efficiency program and supply network strategy our manufacturing network is undergoing significant changes we may be unable to achieve the planned costsavings from these changes in addition we may experience delays and disruptions in our supply network as a result of these activities 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability claims if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name we are aware of at least one pharmacy in the united states and one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims for example as a result of safety concerns related to our product pregsure ®  bvd in 2010 we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu and in 2011 we suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in new zealand 

18   

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals in connection with the separation from pfizer we have changed the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and because of these changes may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws challenges brought against our incentive tax rulings and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies absent a clear understanding of these anomalies regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 



19   

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and could affect sales or regulation of our products any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2016  we generated approximately 46  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real and canadian dollar we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we immediately incurred a foreign currency loss of 9 million on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local assets and liabilities on november 30 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela 

our venezuelan subsidiarys functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy 

effective march 10 2016 the venezuelan government made the following changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms i the threetier exchange rate system existing in the country changed to a dual system with the elimination of the sicad rate ii the official cencoex rate was 

20   

replaced with dipro and was devalued from 63 to 10 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar and iii the simadi rate was replaced with dicom as of november 30 2016 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the dipro rate of 10 and the dicom rate of 663 beginning in the second quarter of 2016 we use the dicom rate to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations for all these and other reasons sales within emerging markets carry significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example the european commission opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain european countries including belgium comply with european union rules on state aid in the case of belgium the european commission concluded on january 11 2016 that the excess profits ruling violates the european union’s state aid rules the impact of this conclusion was a net tax charge of approximately 35 million recorded in 2016 this net charge relates to the belgium governments recovery of benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal and without consideration of implementation of any future operational changes and does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision 

in addition on june 20 2016 the member states of the european union adopted the antitaxavoidance directive proposed on january 28 2016 which is designed to provide uniform implementation of base erosion and profits shifting measures and other minimum taxation standards across member states the member states are required to implement all components of the directive by january 1 2020 once enacted by the member states the results of the directive could have an impact on our effective tax rate in october 2016 the european union also introduced a proposal to impose a uniform set of rules on taxing corporate profits known as the common consolidated corporate tax base this proposal is in its early stages but may have an impact to our effective tax rate 

the new administration in the united states has called for comprehensive tax reform in the us which among other things might change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed on foreign income changes to the tax system in the united states particularly the potential mandatory deemed repatriation tax could have a material impact to our financial statements as of december 31 2016 the cumulative amount of nonus undistributed earnings was approximately 74 billion of this cumulative amount zoetis was allocated 64 billion in nonus undistributed earnings from pfizer as a result of the separation on june 24 2013 with minimal cash associated with these earnings the potential impact of the mandatory deemed repatriation proposal is uncertain as the direction of comprehensive tax reform is being contemplated under the new administration in the united states at this time we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the united states or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

risks related to intellectual property 

the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such action the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that in the absence of a license may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

patent law reform in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions in the recent years have led to us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas a similar court decision in australia was issued recently with regard to the patentability of nucleic acids such reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

22   

risks related to information technology 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we have implemented new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning erp system to better integrate our manufacturing financial commercial and business operations and may in the future implement new information systems transitioning to new systems integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions including from circumstances beyond our control affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed unreliable corrupted insufficient or inaccessible for example although the us implementation of our erp system in 2015 was successful from a systems and controls point of view we experienced challenges with certain of our customers experiencing a disruption in their service due to the large number of customers directly impacted by our change of systems any of these potential issues individually or in aggregation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

assuming we are able to implement new systems successfully all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks breaches of security or misappropriation of data which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks   are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware denialofservice and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability in addition despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information including confidential business information trade secrets and corporate strategic plans defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be unable to adequately protect our customers privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws could result in lost sales remediation costs and legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm   despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

23   

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 45 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we have entered into an agreement for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the pfizerowned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo as a result of these and other factors we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer 

24   

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2016 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 5538 on june 25 2015 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2016  annual report are 

25   

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 16 2016 our board of directors declared the 2017 first quarter dividend of 0105 per share to be paid on march 1 2017 to holders of record on january 20 2017 and on february 14 2016 our board of directors declared the 2017 second quarter dividend of 0105 per share to be paid on june 1 2017 to holders of record on april 6 2017 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

 item 2 properties 

we have 137 owned and leased properties amounting to approximately 106 million square feet around the world for sales and marketing customer service regulatory compliance rd manufacturing and distribution and administrative support functions in many locations operations are colocated to achieve synergies and operational efficiencies our largest rd facility is our owned us research and development site located in kalamazoo michigan which represents approximately 15 million square feet none of our other nonmanufacturing sites are more than 02 million square feet the largest manufacturing site in our global manufacturing network is our manufacturing site located in kalamazoo michigan which represents approximately 06 million square feet no other site in our global manufacturing network is more than 06 million square feet in addition our global manufacturing network will continue to be supplemented by approximately 200 cmos 

our corporate headquarters are located at 10 sylvan way parsippany new jersey 07054 our operations extend internationally to approximately 60 countries under the transitional services agreement we entered into with pfizer pfizer granted us continued access to certain of its premises occupied by our employees prior to the ipo we currently lease space from pfizer in 8 different locations globally mainly in europe 

we believe that our existing properties as supplemented by sites operated by cmos including pfizer and access to pfizer facilities provided under the transitional services agreement are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business these claims and litigation may include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition law labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort we operate in multiple jurisdictions and as a result a claim in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatory penalties in other jurisdictions we intend to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation 

at this time in the opinion of management the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved in addition regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes such matters are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation even if resolved in our favor

on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol “zts” on february 6 2013 an initial public offering ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares with pfizer owning the remaining outstanding shares on june 24 2013 an exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis unless the context requires otherwise statements relating to our history for periods prior to our ipo describe the history of pfizer’s animal health business unit 

a summary of our 2016  performance compared with the comparable 2015  and 2014  periods follows 





our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry sheep and fish livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 



31   

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

in addition negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products for example the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in recent years certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of recent downturns in the global economy further economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses in recent years there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies 

32   

of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

for example from december 2014 through june 2015 highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza virus infections were reported in domestic poultry captive birds and wild birds in the united states with a majority of confirmed infections occurring in backyard and commercial poultry flocks the egg and turkey industry were the most impacted by this occurrence of avian influenza usda surveillance indicates that more than 48 million birds were affected either infected or exposed in at least 20 states although no new h5 avian influenza infections have been detected in the united states since june 2015 an outbreak of highly pathogenic h7 avian influenza infections was reported in a commercial turkey flock in indiana in january 2016 and both forms of the virus continue to pose a threat to the poultry industry in march 2016 we were granted a conditional license from the usda for a vaccine to help prevent avian influenza and in june 2016 we were awarded a contract to supply the usda with this vaccine for the national veterinary stockpile the vaccine is intended for use in chickens as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by the h5n1 subtype of the virus the usda will determine if a vaccination program should be implemented it is important to note that human infection with avian influenza viruses has not occurred from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products we are closely monitoring the developments as this situation unfolds the impact on our 2016 global revenue was not significant 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 46  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro uk pound and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 54  of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 2  from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

in february 2014 the venezuelan government issued a law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 at the time of its issuance there was uncertainty as to how the law would be interpreted and applied the venezuelan government also recently issued new regulations relating to the publication of these fair prices to consumers while we believe we are currently fully compliant with this new law it is uncertain how this law may be interpreted and enforced in the future 

effective march 10 2016 the venezuelan government made the following changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms i the threetier exchange rate system existing in the country changed to a dual system with the elimination of the sicad rate ii the official cencoex rate was replaced with dipro and was devalued from 63 to 10 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar and iii the simadi rate was replaced with dicom as of november 30 2016 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the dipro rate of 10 and the dicom rate of 663 beginning in the second quarter of 2016 we use the dicom rate to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows 

based on all of the factors noted above in the second quarter of 2015 we decided to decrease our activity in venezuela in 2015 on november 30 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela as a result as of november 30 2016 our net monetary assets in venezuela were 1 million our revenue from venezuela was less than 1 million for the year ended november 30 2016 as compared with approximately 65 million for the year ended november 30 2015 

33   

operational efficiency program and supply network strategy 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit ten manufacturing sites over the long term as of december 31 2016 we divested or exited three us manufacturing sites two international manufacturing sites and our 55 percent ownership share of a taiwan joint venture inclusive of its related manufacturing site we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of these initiatives we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2016  approximately 1800 positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next six months 

for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4b acquisitions divestitures and certain investments divestitures and note 5 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 



components of revenue and costs and expenses 

our revenue costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the united states for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

revenue 

our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals generally our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists and then sold directly by us or through distributors the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies in 2016  our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 7  of our revenue the ceftiofur line and our next three top selling products revolution draxxin and apoquel contributed approximately 25  of our revenue our top ten selling product lines contributed approximately 40  of our revenue for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2016  see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales  consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga  expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd  expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and product lifecycle innovation overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses 

34   

related to regulatory approvals for our products we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs  consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as pharmaq holding as and abbott animal health aah in 2015 and the fdah business acquired as part of pfizers acquisition of wyeth in 2009 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net  consist primarily of various items including net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income foreign exchange translation gainslosses and certain asset impairment charges 

comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer 

prior to the separation from pfizer the combined financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pfizer and included allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the animal health business of pfizer the preseparation financial statements and activities do not purport to reflect what the results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent public company during the periods presented 

our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we currently incur as an independent public company with respect to support functions for example for the periods prior to the ipo our historical combined financial statements include expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within pfizer such as expenses for business technology facilities legal finance human resources and to a lesser extent business development public affairs and procurement among others as part of the separation from pfizer pursuant to agreements with pfizer pfizer provides us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreedupon fees and we are incurring other costs to replace the services and resources that will not be provided by pfizer 

we have also incurred certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming an independent public company including new branding which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure site separation and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies— estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4  acquisitions divestitures and certain investments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

35   

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 3 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized 

as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment reviews we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 

we recorded the following identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable 

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 204 million  as of december 31 2016  iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

36   

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2016 we qualitatively assessed as of october 2 2016 whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying amounts including goodwill based on that assessment we determined that this condition does not exist for any of our reporting units and therefore concluded that a quantitative fair value test was not required 

in 2015 we quantitatively assessed as of september 27 2015 the fair value of each of our reporting units using the income approach the fair value of each reporting unit was found to exceed its respective carrying value therefore no impairments were recorded 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios changing our selling approach in certain markets and reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit certain manufacturing sites over the long term we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes as part of this initiative we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000  to 2500  subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2016  approximately 1800 positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next six months 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated costs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 5 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives  

2016 vs 2015 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs decreased  by  315 million  or 98  in 2016  compared with 2015  primarily as a result of higher employee termination costs and higher asset impairment charges incurred in 2015 as a result of the launch of our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy as well as lower transaction costs in 2016 

2015 vs 2014    

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs increased  by  295 million  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily as a result of an increase in employee termination costs and asset impairment charges as a result of our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items described below the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored metrics designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

46   

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until realized

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic business and financial volatility as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 



 for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets  and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2016  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which expires in december 2021 the credit facility replaced the company’s existing revolving credit facility dated as of december 21 2012 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 4251  for the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2016 and 3501  for any fiscal quarter thereafter upon entering into a material acquisition the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4001  and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition 

the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501  the amended agreement includes a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda any operational efficiency restructuring charge defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1 2016 and ending december 31 2019 related to operational efficiency initiatives provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed 100 million in the aggregate 

in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  there were no  amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31 2016  or december 31 2015  

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2016  we had access to 75 million  of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2017 and are generally renewed annually we did not have any borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2016  shortterm borrowings outstanding related to these facilities were 4 million  as of december 31 2015  

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in the united states will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states no accrual for us taxes is provided 

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental tax employee andor productrelated matters and patentinfringement claims if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification we would be required to reimburse the loss these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations historically we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015 recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant 

new accounting standards 

for discussion of our new accounting standards see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies—new accounting standards  

recently issued accounting standards not adopted as of december 31 2016 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update which clarifies the definition of a business under the new guidance a set of integrated activities and assets is a business only if it has at a minimum an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs the update also introduces the concept of an initial screening or “step 1” which requires companies to first determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single or group of similar identifiable assets transactions comprised substantially of similar identifiable assets will not be considered a business transactions that pass the step 1 screening will be considered a business if they contain an input and substantive process and either 1 an output or 2 an organized workforce with skills critical to the ability to create outputs and inputs that can be utilized to create the outputs companies will no longer be required to evaluate whether a market participant could replace any missing inputs or processes instead focusing on the substance of what was acquired the provisions of the new standard are effective on a prospective basis beginning january 1 2018 for annual and interim reporting periods and may be adopted early for any transactions not yet reported in issued financial statements we plan to early adopt this guidance for any new transactions occurring on or after january 1 2017 

in october 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity asset transfer other than inventory when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the asset is sold to an outside third party the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2018 for annual and interim reporting periods using a modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted beginning on january 1 2017 we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2018 the required effective date and do not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern for lessees the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital and operating leases respectively accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged companies may elect to exclude shortterm leases the update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2019 for annual and interim reporting periods early adoption is permitted beginning on january 1 2017 the new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we continue to assess the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

54   

in july 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the measurement of inventory by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market with market being defined as either replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2017 for annual and interim reporting periods the guidance will be adopted prospectively and early adoption is permitted we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2017 the required effective date and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers this update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance includes a fivestep model for determining how when and how much revenue should be recognized this update also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2018 the required effective date using the modified retrospective transition method under the modified retrospective method the cumulative effect of applying the new standard will be recognized as of the date of initial application with disclosure of results under both the new and prior standards 

we continue to assess the impact of the new standard on our current policies and procedures related to revenue recognition based on the work performed to date we do not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements while implementation procedures are still ongoing we have evaluated the impact on our primary revenue stream product sales in both the united states and our key international markets and no matters have currently been identified individually or in the aggregate that would have a material impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognition based on the provisions of the new standard

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and uk pound we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instruments at december 31 2016  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2016  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  31 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  38 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9b financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2016  we had no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 9 financial instruments

we were incorporated in delaware in july 2012 the address of our principal executive offices is 100 campus drive florham park new jersey 07932 unless the context requires otherwise references to “zoetis” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015 2015 annual report refer to zoetis inc a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries in addition unless the context requires otherwise references to “pfizer” in this 2015 annual report refer to pfizer inc a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise statements relating to our history for periods prior to our initial public offering ipo describe the history of pfizer’s animal health business unit although it is important to note that the net assets operations and cash flows of zoetis are not the same as the historical net assets operations and cash flows of pfizers animal health operating segment 

on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol “zts” on february 6 2013 an ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares prior to and in connection with the ipo we completed a 365 billion senior notes offering senior notes offering and pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of their animal health business we did not receive any of the proceeds from the ipo we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo in addition immediately prior to the completion of the ipo we and pfizer entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer on june 24 2013 an exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis we refer to the transactions to separate our business from pfizer as described here and elsewhere in this 2015 annual report as the “separation” for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 2 the separation adjustments associated with the separation senior notes offering initial public offering and exchange offer 

operating segments   

the animal health medicines and vaccines market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

 as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in two segments the united states and international within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs our operating segments are 

 in addition our client supply services css organization provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and represented 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015

products 

over the course of our history we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products including medicines and vaccines complemented by biodevices diagnostics and genetics we refer to a single product in all brands or its dosage forms for all species as a product line we have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines including products for both livestock and companion animals across each of our major product categories 

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food quality and safety livestock products represented approximately 62  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 37  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  

in addition our client supply services css organization provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and represented 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenue is derived from other product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in complementary areas including biodevices diagnostics and genetics 

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle innovation historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede ®  excenel ®  rtu excenel ®  rtu ez excenel ®  naxcel ®  and spectramast ®  

examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in the past ten years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation include 

 3   

we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the united states and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the united states the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the united states and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the h3n2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the united states 

in 2015  our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 8  of our revenue the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution ®  and draxxin ®  contributed approximately 21  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 38  of our revenue our product lines and products that represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2015  which comprise 58  of our total revenue are as follows 

livestock products

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and our products are sold in more than 100 countries operations outside the united states accounted for 51  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico emerging markets contributed 23  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to our international operations  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2015  our sales organization consisted of approximately 2800  employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that typically then sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented 

5   

approximately 14 and 9 respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  and no other customer represented more than 5 of our revenue for the same period 

research and development 

our rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development registration and regulatory maintenance of our products we spent  364 million  in 2015   396 million  in 2014  and  399 million  in 2013  on rd 

our rd efforts are comprised of more than 300 programs and reflect our commitment to develop better solutions we create new insights for preventing and treating disease and maximizing healthy performance that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation leveraging internal discoveries complemented by diverse external research collaborations results in the delivery of novel vaccine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd plays a critical role in our growth strategies the majority of our rd investment including regulatory functions is focused on product lifecycle innovation a commitment to continuous innovation based on customer need ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries we also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in diagnostics and genetics research ensuring we can help our customers diagnose prevent and treat a variety of conditions 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend this view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing rd and other industries supports a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process 

prior to the ipo we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer pursuant to which we maintain access to pfizers proprietary compound library and database to develop new products subject to certain restrictions see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer research and development collaboration and license agreement    in addition we regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies some of our external partnerships involve funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for as well as investment in such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 1050  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in melbourne australia louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil guarulhos brazil olot spain and lincoln nebraska united states we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing it is our intention to exit our rd operations in guarulhos brazil and melbourne australia by the end of 2016 in addition we maintain rd operations in sydney australia zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china mumbai india and durham north carolina united states we lease our mumbai india facility from pfizer see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer mumbai india interim lease agreement  additionally as a result of the recent acquisition of pharmaq we maintain rd operations in thanh binh vietnam hong ngu vietnam and oslo norway focused on fish vaccines each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 28  sites which utilizes centralized oversight of a system of 17  “anchor” and 11  “satellite” manufacturing sites to maximize cost efficiencies 

6   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 in 2015 we exited our manufacturing site in shenzhou china as part of our operational efficiency program and supply network strategy 

we own all of these sites with the exception of our facilities in melbourne australia medolla italy van buren arkansas united states and san diego california united states which are leased sites 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at 11  pfizer sites located in 11 countries pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement included in these 11  pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a short period of time see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements   

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2015  this network was comprised of approximately 200  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites we are currently conducting a review of our global manufacturing and supply network to improve efficiency and have announced plans to exit or sell certain sites see operational efficiency program  

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

7   

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc merial the animal health division of sanofi sa elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag and boehringer ingelheim animal health the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

our livestock products tend to experience lower generic competition than our companion animal products for several reasons 

 the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 4800 granted patents and 2000 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with concentration in our major market countries as well as other countries with strong patent systems such as australia brazil canada europe japan and the united states many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own and pfizers work while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were at least partially developed by and are licensed to us by third parties 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods depending on the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained several patents covering the ceftiofur antibiotic product line began expiring in the united states in 2015 however various formulation and use patents extend through to 2024 draxxin is covered by compound and formulation patents in the united states and europe with terms that expire between late 2018 and 2021 the compound patent for the parasiticide selamectin the active ingredient in revolution expired during 2014 however process and formulation patents covering this product expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

in order to facilitate the separation and allow pfizer and our operations to continue with minimal interruption pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a transitional license to use certain of pfizers trademarks and we granted pfizer a transitional license to use certain of our trademarks for a period of time following the completion of the ipo 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 10000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

operational efficiency program 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit ten manufacturing sites over the long term as of december 31 2015 we entered into an agreement to divest three us manufacturing sites and in january 2016 we announced agreements to sell manufacturing facilities in india and taiwan we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of this initiative we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2015 approximately 1200 positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next nine to twelve months

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products

european union eu the european medicines agency ema is the centralized regulatory agency of the eu located in london the agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by healthcare companies seeking centralized approval for use in the eu the agency has a veterinary review section distinct from the medical review section the committee for veterinary medicinal products cvmp is responsible for scientific and technical review of the submissions for innovative pharmaceuticals biopharmaceuticals and vaccines after the cvmp issues a positive opinion on the approvability of a product the eu commission reviews the opinion and if they agree with the cvmp they grant the product market authorization once granted by the european commission a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all eu and european economic areaeuropean free trade association states products can also be registered in the eu via a decentralized route under the supervision of the coordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures  veterinary cmdv this coordination group is composed of one representative per member state from each national regulatory agency including norway iceland and liechtenstein the cmdv reviews submissions of pharmaceuticals and vaccines for authorization of a veterinary product in two or more member states in accordance with the mutual recognition or the decentralized procedure a series of regulations directives guidelines and eu pharmacopeia monographs provide the requirements for product approval in the eu in general these requirements are similar to those in the united states requiring demonstrated evidence of safety efficacy and qualityconsistency of manufacturing processes 

brazil  the ministry of agriculture livestock production and supply mapa is the regulatory body in brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use mapas regulatory activities are conducted through the secretary of agricultural defense and its livestock products inspection department in addition regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the federal agriculture superintendence these activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products as well as the submission review and approval of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives mapa is one of the most active regulatory agencies in latin america having permanent seats at several international animal health forums such as codex alimentarius world organization for animal health and committee of veterinary medicines for the americas mapa was also invited to be a latin american representative at meetings of the international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich several normative instructions issued by mapa have set regulatory trends in latin america 

australia the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority apvma is an australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the australian marketplace previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration the apvma assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the apvmas scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments if the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people animals the environment or international trade the apvma will register the product as well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products the apvma reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job 

9   

users expect and are safe to use the apvma also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness the review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used in some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market 

rest of world  countryspecific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling safety efficacy and manufacturers quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products as well as company records and reports with the exception of the eu most other countries regulatory agencies will generally refer to the fda usda eu and other international animal health entities including the world organization for animal health codex alimentarius in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines 

global policy and guidance 

joint faowho expert committee on food additives  the joint faowho expert committee on food additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the world health organization who they provide a risk assessmentsafety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs we work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in foodproducing animals after treatment this in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain 

advertising and promotion review promotion of prescription animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries these rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency we conduct a review of promotion materials for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products 

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich vich is a trilateral eujapanusa program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration the objectives of the vich are as follows 

 employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 9000  employees worldwide which included approximately 3900  employees in the united states and approximately 5100  in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50  union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2015  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

10   

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

recent acquisitions 

on november 9 2015 we completed a transaction through which we acquired pharmaq a leading global animal health company specializing in vaccines and innovation for aquaculture 

on february 10 2015 we completed the purchase of certain assets of abbott animal health a subsidiary of abbott laboratories abbott animal health is a companion animal health business focused on the veterinary surgical suite the purchase expands our companion animal product portfolio to include veterinarian solutions for anesthesia pain management and the diagnosis of diabetes

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this 2015 annual report any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline 

this report contains “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements reflect our current views with respect to among other things future events and performance we generally identify forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “could” “expect” “intend” “project” “plan” “predict” “believe” “seek” “continue” “outlook” “may” “might” “will” “should” “can have” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance actions or events forwardlooking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information these statements are not guarantees of future performance actions or events 

in particular forwardlooking statements include statements relating to our indebtedness our ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness our ability to satisfy the covenants contained in our indebtedness the redemption of the notes expectations regarding indebtedness the repurchase of shares future use of cash and dividend payments future actions business plans or prospects prospective products product approvals or products under development rd costs timing and likelihood of success future operating or financial performance future results of current and anticipated products and services strategies sales efforts expenses production efficiencies production margins interest rates tax rates changes in tax regimes and laws foreign exchange rates growth in emerging markets the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings our agreements with pfizer the expected timing and content of regulatory actions government regulation and financial results forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and are potentially inaccurate assumptions however there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if managements underlying beliefs and assumptions prove to be incorrect actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forwardlooking statement you should not put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports and our other filings with the sec we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  

for example in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the united states over a threeyear period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian the fda indicated that they took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans zoetis supports the fdas efforts to voluntarily phaseout growth promotion indications for medically important antibiotics in food producing animals and will comply with procedures outlined in the december 2013 fda guidance in addition in october 2014 the french parliament passed a law that prohibits rebates and discounts on antibiotics and requires the reporting of antibiotics sold to and agreements entered into with certain animal healthcare providers including veterinarians veterinary schools pharmacists and students the parliament indicated that the law is in response to a government initiative aimed at fighting antimicrobial resistance in animals and reducing the use of certain categories of antibiotics by 25 compared to 2013 by december 31 2016 

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

12   

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore new or more stringent regulations could directly or indirectly impact the use of one or more of our products more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes in recent years outbreaks of various diseases including avian influenza footandmouth disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv have impacted the animal health business for example incidences of bse in the united states and brazil in 2012 led certain countries to implement additional inspections of or suspend the importation of us and brazilian beef similarly outbreaks of highly pathogenic h5 avian flu affected infected or exposed 48 million birds in the united states in 2014 and 2015 and significantly impacted the egg and turkey industry the discovery of additional cases of any of these or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins reduced herd sizes or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers have seen recent consolidation in their industries furthermore we have seen the expansion of larger crossborder corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers the pace of customer consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the widespread drought that impacted the united states in 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013 droughts such as this one can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products in addition droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures forcing cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers for example the economic downturns experienced in many markets across the globe have had an impact on certain of our customers and as a result on our operating results in those affected markets if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

13   

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products our patent protection for these products extends for varying periods in accordance with the dates of filing or grant and the legal life of patents in countries in which patents are granted the protection afforded by our patents which varies from country to country is limited by the following in the applicable country the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before our patent rights expire and their pricing and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions in addition private label products may compete with our products for example in july and december 2014 several companies launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product as a result sales of our rimadyl chewable product decreased by approximately 6 in 2015 if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we estimate that approximately 80 of our revenue in 2014 was derived from products that are either unpatented ie never patented or offpatent or covered by our patents that while providing a competitive advantage may not provide market exclusivity over the next several years several of our products patents will expire 

14   

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements 

we are pursuing and will continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets operational revenue growth through new product development and valueadded product lifecycle innovation improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt and expanding our complementary products and services we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies including those acquired and those developed internally additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers our executive officers are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may experience difficulties delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced comprehensive operational efficiency initiative 

on may 5 2015 we announced an initiative to simplify our operations improve our efficiency and cost structure and better allocate our resources to key growth opportunities in animal health as part of the initiative we have reduced staff and plan to close or divest certain facilities we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits and savings from our efforts due to unforeseen difficulties the complexity inherent in unwinding our current structure and delays or unexpected costs which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

following the completion of our program we will execute our business initiatives with fewer staff and in some instances existing employees will be transitioning to new key roles we must also attract retain and motivate key employees who are critical to our business if we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members transition key roles andor attract retain and motivate key employees it may adversely impact our business 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2015 we had goodwill of  1455 million  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  1190 million  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of 

15   

income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical combined financial data for periods prior to the ipo the years ended december 31 2011 and 2012 and the period ended january 31 2013 included in this 2015 annual report does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily the result of the following factors 

 our financial condition and future results of operations will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this 2015 annual report for the periods prior to the ipo as a result of the separation it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research in addition to the rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer we expect to enter into other collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities on december 31 2015 we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 28  manufacturing sites located in 12  countries as part of our operational efficiency program we have subsequently exited or are in the process of exiting certain of these sites for more information see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— recent developments  in addition 11  pfizer sites located in 11  countries manufacture certain of our products for us included in these pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a short period of time these pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products we also employ a network of approximately 200  cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site in addition we have experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel that have impacted our ability to meet customer demand as a result we have had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians can purchase and have delayed the launch of the product in certain markets 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

as part of our operational efficiency program our manufacturing network is undergoing significant changes we may be unable to achieve the planned costsavings from these changes in addition we may experience delays and disruptions in our supply network as a result of these activities 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities 

17   

breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent andor which are sold under our brand name in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims for example as a result of safety concerns related to our product pregsure ®  bvd in 2010 we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu and in 2011 we suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in new zealand also in may 2013 we were advised that the european commission started a procedure regarding the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn ®  pcv a vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 in swine the initiation of the procedure followed a recall of two batches of suvaxyn ®  pcv as a result of higher than expected adverse reactions reported mainly in spain in june 2013 we completed a root cause investigation of the higher than expected adverse reactions in these two batches and subsequently submitted to the ema a proposed variation to describe specific adjustments to the manufacturing process to help minimize the risk of future reactive batches in october 2013 the ema’s committee on medicinal products for veterinary use adopted a positive opinion as to the proposed variation and concurrently adopted an opinion concluding that no action was required at that time with regard to the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn ®  pcv both opinions were transmitted to the european commission according to the applicable procedure and the commission officially advised us in january 2014 that it had adopted those positive opinions and concluded the procedure begun in may 2013 by maintaining the marketing authorization for suvaxyn ®  pcv in effect 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

18   

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals in connection with the separation we will likely change the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and because of these changes may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws challenges brought against our incentive tax rulings and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies absent a clear understanding of these anomalies regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

a failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 19   

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2015 we generated approximately 47  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro brazilian real and canadian dollar we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we immediately incurred a foreign currency loss of 9 million on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local assets and liabilities 

our venezuelan subsidiarys functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government expanded its exchange mechanisms resulting in three official rates of exchange for the venezuelan bolivar 

on february 10 2015 the venezuelan government announced that they would continue to operate with a threetier exchange rate system in addition they announced that the primary rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar would remain in place for imports that are deemed essential a new freefloating rate simadi replaced the existing thirdtier rate sicad ii as of december 31 2015 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the cencoex official rate of 63 the sicad i rate of 135 and the simadi rate of 199 

through the fourth quarter of 2015 we used the cencoex official rate of 63 to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2015 upon evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela and our expectation of venezuelas responses to changes in its economy continued volatility and the fact that we have not received any approved payments from venezuela for transactions at the cencoex official rate of 63 per us dollar in 2015 we determined that our outstanding venezuelan bolivardenominated net monetary assets are no longer expected to be settled at the cencoex official rate of 63 but rather at the simadi rate of 199 on november 30 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela using the simadi rate of 199 bolivars to the us dollar and this rate will be used prospectively we believe this best represents the estimate of the us dollar amount that will ultimately be collected additionally the company recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory of 4 million and asset impairment charges of 3 million 

on february 17 2016 the venezuela government made an announcement that the threetier exchange rate system existing in the country has changed to a dual system official rate and simadi rate additionally the official rate was devalued from 63 to 10 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

20   

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america have been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations for all these and other reasons sales within emerging markets carry significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example the european commission opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain european countries including belgium comply with european union rules on state aid in the case of belgium the european commission concluded on january 11 2016 that the excess profits ruling violates the european union’s state aid rules the impact of this conclusion will have a material impact on our effective tax rate in 2016 in addition on january 28 2016 the european union presented an antitaxavoidance directive designed to provide uniform implementation of base erosion and profits shifting measures and minimum standards across member states if enacted this proposed directive could have an impact on our effective tax rate 

in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the united states or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of dispute we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such claims the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to 

21   

which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition patent law reform in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance us court decisions in the last three years have led to interim us patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas a similar court decision in australia was issued recently with regard to the patentability of nucleic acids such reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property andor limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the ipo and the separation we have substantially changed a number of our business processes including our financial reporting and supply chain processes in order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with pfizer we have made significant configuration and data changes within some of our information technology systems if our information and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and our operations may be adversely affected and as a result our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

in addition we are implementing new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning erp system to better integrate our manufacturing financial commercial and business operations there is risk associated with ensuring that the milestones timelines and budget associated with these new systems stay on track transitioning to new systems integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions including from circumstances beyond our control affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed unreliable corrupted insufficient or inaccessible any of these potential issues individually or in aggregation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

assuming we are able to implement these systems successfully all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may experience difficulties with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an erp system the erp system is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the implementation of the erp will require significant 

22   

investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp system we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties while we have invested significant resources in planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues may arise for example although the us implementation of our erp system has been successful from a systems and controls point of view due to the large number of customers directly impacted by our change of systems we have experienced challenges with certain of our customers experiencing a disruption in their service any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks   are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware denialofservice and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability a successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for our company including the disruption of operations the misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be unable to adequately protect our customers privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws could result in lost sales remediation costs legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm   despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 49 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we have entered into an agreement for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 23   

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the pfizerowned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo as a result of these and other factors we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our

3250 senior notes due 2023 see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence — relationship with pfizer tax matters agreement 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

for a summary description of the terms of the patent and knowhow license pfizer as licensor see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer intellectual property license agreements 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant charges in connection with the separation and incremental costs as an independent public company 

prior to the separation pfizer performed or supported many important corporate functions for our company our combined financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis following the separation many of these services are governed by our transitional services agreement with pfizer under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party upon prior written notice subject to limited cure periods 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for these services based on pfizers costs of providing the services during the two years following the ipo the markup for these services was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7 for the services that pfizer continues to provide to zoetis under this agreement a 7 markup applied for 2015 and will apply for the remainder of 2016 since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parentsubsidiary relationship the terms of the agreement including the fees charged for the services may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arms length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical financial statements thirdparty costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost in addition while these services are being provided to us by pfizer our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited 

we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate thirdparty agreements on terms and conditions including cost comparable to those that we receive from pfizer under our transitional services agreement additionally after the agreement terminates we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from pfizer when we begin to operate these functions separately if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or are unable to obtain them from other providers we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs and our profitability may decline 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2015 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 5538 on june 25 2015 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2015 annual report are 

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 16 2015 our board of directors declared the 2016 first quarter dividend of 0095 per share to be paid on march 1 2016 to holders of record on january 21 2016 and on february 19 2016 our board of directors declared the 2016 second quarter dividend of 0095 per share to be paid on june 1 2016 to holders of record on april 7 2016 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

inprocess research and development 

iprd assets represent rd assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market the majority of these iprd assets were acquired in connection with our acquisition of pharmaq 

iprd assets are required to be classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated rd effort accordingly during the development period after the date of acquisition these assets will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market typically either the united states or the eu or in a series of other countries subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment at that time we will determine the useful life of the asset reclassify the asset out of iprd and begin amortization if the associated rd effort is abandoned the related iprd assets will be writtenoff and we will record an impairment charge 

for iprd assets there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product 

product rights 

product rights represent product registration and application rights that were acquired from pfizer in 2014 see note 20 transactions and agreements with pfizer

obligations and funded status––dedicated plans 

the following table provides an analysis of the changes in the benefit obligations plan assets and funded status of our dedicated pension plans including those transferred to us 



 actuarial losses were approximately  23 million   16 million  net of tax at december 31 2015  and  33 million   25 million  net of tax at december 31 2014  the actuarial gains and losses primarily represent the cumulative difference between the actuarial assumptions and actual return on plan assets changes in discount rates and changes in other assumptions used in measuring the benefit obligations these actuarial gains and losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss  at december 31 2014 the actuarial losses included approximately 15 million   11 million  net of tax associated with the plans transferred to us from pfizer during 2014 the actuarial losses will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over an average period of 131  years

the settlement loss for the year ended december 31 2014 includes a settlement charge of approximately 4 million  approximately 3 million  net of tax associated with the 2012 sale of our netherlands manufacturing facility the pension assets associated with this plan were financed through an insurance contract for which the insurer was responsible for the investment of the plan assets the active participants in the plan were transferred to the buyer at the time of sale and the plan liability associated with inactive participants remained with the insurance contract that was used to finance the plan the insurance contract was also transferred to the buyer although we remained liable for the proportion of administrative costs that related to inactive members under the terms of this contract through december 31 2013 under the terms of the sale agreement the contract was terminated on december 31 2013 fiscal year 2014 for our international operations and the liability for benefits associated with this plan reverted in full to the insurance company 

actuarial assumptions––dedicated plans 

the following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions for the dedicated pension plans including those transferred to us 



the assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at the end of the year and to develop the net periodic benefit cost for the following year therefore the assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations are established at each yearend the net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis the assumptions are revised based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits in 2013 the calculation of the weighted average expected rate of compensation increase used to determine benefit obligations excluded the netherlands plan as that plan had no active participants at december 31 2013 the plan was terminated on december 31 2013 

actuarial and other assumptions for pension plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions

the components of plan assets follow   



 a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions   

89   

specifically the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension assets 

 the longterm target asset allocations and the percentage of the fair value of plans assets for dedicated benefit plans follow   



zoetis utilizes longterm asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets longterm return expectations are developed with input from outside investment consultants based on the company’s investment strategy which takes into account historical experience as well as the impact of portfolio diversification active portfolio management and the investment consultant’s view of current and future economic and financial market conditions as market conditions and other factors change the targets may be adjusted accordingly and actual asset allocations may vary from the target allocations 

the longterm asset allocation ranges reflect the asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of the respective plans’ longterm benefit obligations these ranges are supported by an analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and our liability profile this analysis referred to as an assetliability analysis also provides an estimate of expected returns on plan assets as well as a forecast of potential future asset and liability balances 

the investment consultants review investment performance with zoetis on a quarterly basis in total as well as by asset class relative to one or more benchmarks 

cash flows—dedicated plans 

our plans are generally funded in amounts that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax and other laws 

we expect to contribute approximately 8 million  to our dedicated pension plans in 2016 benefit payments are expected to be approximately 5 million  for 2016 4 million  for 2017 5 million  per year for 2018 and 2019 and 6 million  for 2020 benefit payments are expected to be approximately  34 million  in the aggregate for the five years thereafter these expected benefit payments reflect the future plan benefits subsequent to 2016 projected to be paid from the plans or from the general assets of zoetis entities under the current actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and therefore actual benefit payments may differ from projected benefit payments 

multiemployer plans    

pension expense associated with international benefit plans accounted for as multiemployer plans was approximately 5 million  in 2014 and 7 million  in 2013 contributions to these plans were approximately 5 million  and 7 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively there were no plans accounted for as multiemployer plans in 2015

employees in the united states who meet certain eligibility requirements participate in a supplemental nonqualified savings plan sponsored by zoetis the cost of the supplemental savings plan was 2 million  and 3 million  in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

c defined contribution plans 

zoetis has a voluntary defined contribution plan zoetis savings plan that allows participation by substantially all u s employees zoetis matches 100  of employee contributions up to a maximum of 5  of each employee’s eligible compensation the zoetis savings plan also includes a profitsharing feature that provides for an additional contribution ranging between 0  and 8  percent of each employee’s eligible compensation all eligible employees receive the profitsharing contribution regardless of the amount they choose to contribute to the zoetis savings plan the profitsharing contribution is a discretionary amount provided by zoetis and is determined on an annual basis employees can direct their contributions and the companys matching and profitsharing contributions into any of the funds offered these funds provide participants with a cross section of investing options including the zoetis stock fund through december 31 2014 matching and profitsharing contributions were funded through the issuance of zoetis common stock beginning in 2015 these contributions were cash funded 

90   

employees are permitted to diversify all or any portion of their company matching or profitsharing contribution once the contributions have been paid zoetis has no further payment obligations contribution expense associated with the us defined contribution plans totaled approximately  43 million  in 2015   38 million  in 2014  and  35 million  in 2013

 the components of sharebased compensation expense follow 



 stock options represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock within a specified period of time at a specified price the exercise price for a stock option will be not less than 100  of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant stock options granted may include those intended to be “incentive stock options” within the meaning of section 422 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code 

stock options are accounted for using a fairvaluebased method at the date of grant in the consolidated statement of income the values determined through this fairvaluebased method generally are amortized on a straightline basis over the vesting term into cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses as appropriate 

eligible employees may receive zoetis stock option awards zoetis stock option awards generally vest after three  years of continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of 10  years 

the fairvaluebased method for valuing each zoetis stock option grant on the grant date uses the blackscholes optionpricing model which incorporates a number of valuation assumptions noted in the following table shown at their weightedaverage values 



 for 2014 determined using implied volatility

 the following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 



the number of stock options outstanding under the companys equity plan that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been antidilutive were approximately 1 million  shares as of december 31 2015  and were de minimis as of both december 31 2014  and 2013  

 we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for a discussion of our tax contingencies see note 9 tax matters  

 our nontax contingencies include among others the following 

 certain of these contingencies could result in losses including damages fines andor civil penalties andor criminal charges which could be substantial 

we believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur we do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position however we could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

we have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and therefore determining the likelihood of a loss andor the measurement of any loss can be complex consequently we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management but the assessment process relies on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions 

amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions 

the principal matters to which we are a party are discussed below in determining whether a pending matter is significant for financial reporting and disclosure purposes we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in order to assess materiality such as among other things the amount of damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding if such damages and other relief are specified our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses whether the action purports to be a class action and our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending any experience that we or to our knowledge other companies have had in similar proceedings whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information about the company that is available to the reader the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation and the extent of public interest in the matter in addition with respect to patent matters we consider among other things the financial significance of the product protected by the patent

pregsure ®   

we have received in total approximately 255  claims in europe and new zealand seeking damages related to calves claimed to have died of bovine neonatal pancytopenia bnp on farms where pregsure bvd a vaccine against bovine virus diarrhea bvd was used bnp is a rare syndrome that first emerged in cattle in europe in 2006 studies of bnp suggest a potential association between the administration of pregsure and the development of bnp although no causal connection has been established the cause of bnp is not known 

in 2010  we voluntarily stopped sales of pregsure bvd in europe and recalled the product at wholesalers while investigations into possible causes of bnp continued in 2011  after incidences of bnp were reported in new zealand we voluntarily withdrew the marketing authorization for pregsure throughout the world 

we have settled approximately 155  of these claims for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate investigations into possible causes of bnp continue and these settlements may not be representative of any future claims resolutions

ulianopolis brazil 

in february 2012 the municipality of ulianopolis state of para brazil filed a complaint against fort dodge saúde animal ltda fdsal and five  other large companies alleging that waste sent to a local waste incineration facility for destruction but that was not ultimately destroyed as the facility lost its operating permit caused environmental impacts requiring cleanup 

the municipality is seeking recovery of cleanup costs purportedly related to fdsals share of all waste accumulated at the incineration facility awaiting destruction and compensatory damages to be allocated among the six  defendants we believe we have strong arguments against the claim including defense strategies against any claim of joint and several liability 

at the request of the municipal prosecutor in april 2012 the lawsuit was suspended for one  year since that time the prosecutor has initiated investigations into the municipalitys actions in the matter as well as the efforts undertaken by the six  defendants to remove and dispose of their individual waste from the incineration facility on october 3 2014 the municipal prosecutor announced that the investigation remained ongoing and outlined the terms of a proposed term of reference a document that establishes the minimum elements to be addressed in the preparation of an environmental impact assessment under which the companies would be liable to withdraw the waste and remediate the area on march 5 2015 we presented our response to the prosecutor’s proposed term of reference arguing that the proposed terms were overly general in nature and expressing our interest in discussing alternatives to address the matter the prosecutor agreed to consider our request to engage a technical consultant to conduct an environmental diagnostic of the contaminated area on may 29 2015 we in conjunction with the other defendant companies submitted a draft cooperation agreement to the prosecutor which outlined the proposed terms and conditions for the engagement of a technical consultant to conduct the environmental diagnostic the prosecutor however denied the proposal and reiterated his request that each defendant agree to become a signatory to the term of reference as originally proposed on october 5 2015 we informed the prosecutor of our decision not to sign the term reference and requested a facetoface meeting to clarify the scope and methodology of the preliminary assessment to understand the exact reasons for the rejection of our proposal to engage a technical consultant and to discuss alternative scenarios the prosecutor granted our request and the meeting was held on november 6 2015 at which we provided clarifications and additional information at the request of the prosecutor on november 13 2015 we submitted a letter rendering additional clarification regarding the proposal to conduct a limited study at the site  the prosecutor is still assessing this information 

lascadoil contamination in animal feed 

an investigation by the us food and drug administration fda and the michigan department of agriculture is ongoing to determine how lascadoil oil for industrial use made its way into the feed supply of certain turkey and hog feed mills in michigan the contaminated feed is believed to have caused the deaths of approximately 50000  turkeys and the contamination but not death of at least 20000  hogs in august 2014 while it remains an open question as to how the lascadoil made its way into the animal feed the allegations are that lascadoil intended to be sold for reuse as biofuel was inadvertently sold to producers of soy oil who in turn unknowingly sold the contaminated soy oil to fat recycling vendors who then sold the contaminated soy oil to feed mills for use in animal feed indeed related to the fda investigation shurgreen farms llc a producer of soy oil recalled certain batches of soy oil allegedly contaminated with lascadoil on october 13 2014 

during the course of its investigation the fda identified the process used to manufacture zoetis’ avatec® lasalocid sodium and bovatec® lasalocid sodium products as one possible source of the lascadoil since lascadoil contains small amounts of lasalocid the active ingredient found in both products zoetis has historically sold any and all industrial lascadoil byproduct to an environmental company specializing in waste disposal the environmental company is contractually obligated to incinerate the lascadoil or resell it for use in biofuel under the terms of the agreement the environmental company is expressly prohibited from reselling the lascadoil to be used as a component in food the fda inspected the zoetis site where avatec and bovatec are manufactured and found no evidence that zoetis was involved in the contamination of the animal feed 

on march 10 2015 plaintiffs restaurant recycling llc “restaurant recycling” and superior feed ingredients llc “superior” both of whom are in the fat recycling business filed a complaint in the seventeenth circuit court for the state of michigan against shurgreen farms alleging negligence and breach of warranty claims arising from their purchase of soy oil allegedly contaminated with lascadoil plaintiffs resold the allegedly contaminated soy oil to turkey feed mills for use in feed ingredient plaintiffs also named zoetis as a defendant in the complaint alleging that zoetis failed to properly manufacture its products and breached an implied warranty that the soy oil was fit for use at turkey and hog mills zoetis was 

96   

served with the complaint on june 3 2015 and we filed our answer denying all allegations on july 15 2015 on august 10 2015 several of the turkey feed mills filed a joint complaint against restaurant recycling superior shurgreen farms and others alleging claims for negligence misrepresentation and breach of warranty arising out of their alleged purchase and use of the contaminated soy oil the complaint raises only one  count against zoetis for negligence we filed an answer to the complaint on november 2 2015 denying the allegation we believe we have strong arguments against all claims 

other matters 

the european commission published a decision on alleged competition law infringements by several human health pharmaceutical companies on june 19 2013 one of the involved legal entities is alpharma llc previously having the name zoetis products llc alpharma llc’s involvement is solely related to its human health activities prior to pfizers acquisition of kingalpharma zoetis paid a fine in the amount of euro 11 million  approximately  14 million  and was reimbursed by pfizer in accordance with the global separation agreement between pfizer and zoetis which provides that pfizer is obligated to indemnify zoetis for any liabilities arising out of claims not related to its animal health assets we filed an appeal of the decision on september 6 2013 

in july 2014 we reached a commercial settlement with several large poultry customers in mexico associated with specific lots of a zoetis poultry vaccine although there have been no quality or efficacy issues with the manufacturing of this vaccine certain shipments from several lots in mexico may have experienced an issue in storage with a third party in mexico that could have impacted their efficacy we issued a recall of these lots in july 2014 and the product is currently unavailable in mexico we recorded a 13 million  charge in other incomedeductions — net  in the second quarter of 2014 and we do not expect any significant additional charges related to this issue in the third quarter of 2014 we were notified of an insurance recovery of 1 million  and have recorded this in other incomedeductions — net  

on march 30 2015 we were served with a complaint filed in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania by two additional customers in mexico alleging damages suffered as a result of the use of poultry vaccines obtained from the recalled lots discussed above we have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on grounds that the complaint fails to properly state a claim on which relief can be granted on september 16 2015 the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part dismissing all claims arising out of tort or fraud as a result the only claims remaining in the lawsuit are based in contract namely breach of express warranty breach of certain implied warranties and unjust enrichment 

b guarantees and indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses we indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental tax employee andor productrelated matters and patentinfringement claims if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification we would be required to reimburse the loss these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations historically we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and as of december 31 2015  recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains a description of our historical performance for periods in which we operated as a business unit of pfizer as well as forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and in the comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer and  forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  sections of this mda 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 60 years as a business unit of pfizer inc pfizer and since 2013 as an independent public company we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs our two operating segments are the united states us and international see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 19 segment geographic and other revenue information  

we directly market our products to livestock producers and veterinarians located in approximately 45 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in the industry’s largest sales organization including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our research and development rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers additionally our management team’s focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing longterm value for our shareholders 

a summary of our 2015 performance compared to the comparable 2014 and 2013 periods follows 



 our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry sheep and fish livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses health professionals indicate that companion animals improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of pet owners factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 

 31   

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle innovation which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health medicines and vaccines customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  

we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in recent years certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of recent downturns in the global economy further economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses there are also several new startup companies working in the animal health area in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors 

32   

influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

for example from december 2014 through june 2015 highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza virus infections were reported in domestic poultry captive birds and wild birds in the united states with a majority of confirmed infections occurring in backyard and commercial poultry flocks the egg and turkey industry were the most impacted by this occurrence of avian influenza usda surveillance indicates that more than 48 million birds were affected either infected or exposed in at least 20 states although no new h5 avian influenza infections have been detected in the united states since june 2015 an outbreak of highly pathogenic h7 avian influenza was reported in a single turkey flock in indiana in january 2016 and both forms of the virus continue to pose a threat to the poultry industry it is important to note that human infection with avian influenza viruses has not occurred from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products we are closely monitoring the developments as this situation unfolds and the impact on our 2015 global revenue was not significant 

manufacturing and supply 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 100 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 47  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro brazilian real canadian dollar australian dollar and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 53  of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 8  from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

on february 10 2015 the venezuelan government announced that they would continue to operate with a threetier exchange rate system in addition they announced that the primary rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar would remain in place for imports that are deemed essential a new freefloating rate simadi replaced the existing thirdtier rate sicad ii as of december 31 2015 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the cencoex official rate of 63 the sicad i rate of 135 and the simadi rate of 199 

through the fourth quarter of 2015 we used the cencoex official rate of 63 to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2015 upon evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela and our expectation of venezuelas responses to changes in its economy continued volatility and the fact that we have not received any approved payments from venezuela for transactions at the cencoex official rate of 63 per us dollar in 2015 we determined that our outstanding venezuelan bolivardenominated net monetary assets are no longer expected to be settled at the cencoex official rate of 63 but rather at the simadi rate of 199 on november 30 2015 we recorded a net remeasurement loss of 89 million on bolivardenominated net monetary assets primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela using the simadi rate of 199 bolivars to the us dollar and this rate will be used prospectively we believe this best represents the estimate of the us dollar amount that will ultimately be collected additionally the company recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory of 4 million and asset impairment charges of 3 million 

in february 2014 the venezuelan government issued a law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 at the time of its issuance there was uncertainty as to how the law would be interpreted and applied the venezuelan government also recently issued new regulations relating to the publication of these fair prices to consumers while we believe we are currently fully compliant with this new law it is uncertain how this law may be interpreted and enforced in the future 

the actions of the venezuelan government described above relating to currency and to the interpretation and enforcement of the law on fair pricing and associated regulations as well as other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela which could result in additional charges and under extreme circumstances could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically 

33   

based on all of the factors noted above in the second quarter of 2015 we decided to decrease our activity in venezuela in 2015 and will further decrease it in 2016 as a result our revenue for the year ended november 30 2015 was approximately 65 million as compared with 77 million for the year ended november 30 2014 

as of november 30 2015 as a result of the revaluation and other charges our net monetary assets were 3 million in venezuela 

on february 17 2016 the venezuela government made an announcement that the threetier exchange rate system existing in the country has changed to a dual system official rate and simadi rate additionally the official rate was devalued from 63 to 10 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar 

operational efficiency program 

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5000 product stock keeping units skus changing our selling approach in certain markets reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit ten manufacturing sites over the long term as of december 31 2015 we entered into an agreement to divest three us manufacturing sites and in january 2016 we announced agreements to sell manufacturing facilities in india and taiwan we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes 

as part of this initiative we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000 to 2500 subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2015 approximately 1200 positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next nine to twelve months

comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer 

prior to the separation the combined financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pfizer and included allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the animal health business of pfizer the preseparation financial statements and activities do not purport to reflect what the results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent public company during the periods presented 

for a detailed description of the basis of presentation and an understanding of the limitations of the predictive value of the historical combined financial statements see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 3 basis of presentation 

our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we currently incur as an independent public company with respect to support functions for example for the periods prior to the ipo our historical combined financial statements include expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within pfizer such as expenses for business technology facilities legal finance human resources and to a lesser extent business development public affairs and procurement among others as part of the separation pursuant to agreements with pfizer pfizer provides us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreedupon fees and we are incurring other costs to replace the services and resources that will not be provided by pfizer 

we have also incurred certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming an independent public company including new branding which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure the accelerated vesting of certain pfizer equity awards and associated cash payment related thereto site separation and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs 

some of our products are manufactured at sites that were retained by pfizer or that are operated by pfizer under a saleleaseback arrangement in 2013 pursuant to the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer we began purchasing these products from pfizer under the master manufacturing and supply agreement our supply price is pfizers costs plus a percentage markup subject to limited exceptions during the two years following the completion of the ipo from february 6 2013 through february 5 2015 the markup was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement the markup will be 15 the cost of each pfizersupplied product is subject to annual review the preseparation period included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2013 included allocations of certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by the manufacturing sites that would not have been charged to us under the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer had such agreement been in effect in the periods presented such as operating variances as well as purchase price and volume variances under a certain threshold in connection with the ipo we and pfizer have entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 20b transactions and agreements with pfizer agreements with pfizer 

following the ipo the equity awards previously granted to our employees by pfizer continued to vest and service with zoetis counted as service with pfizer for equity award purposes on june 24 2013 pfizer completed the exchange offer whereby pfizer disposed of all shares of zoetis common stock owned by pfizer pfizer accelerated the vesting of and in some cases the settlement of on a prorata basis outstanding pfizer restricted stock units rsus total shareholder return units tsrus and performance share awards psas previously granted to our employees subject in each case to the requirements of section 409a of the us internal revenue code the terms of the 2004 pfizer stock plan and the applicable award agreements and any outstanding deferral elections in addition unvested pfizer stock options previously granted to our employees accelerated in full and our employees generally have the ability to exercise the stock options until the earlier of i june 23 2016 three years from pfizers completion of the exchange offer ii termination of their employment from zoetis or iii the expiration date of the stock option zoetis employees who held pfizer stock options and were retirement eligible as of june 24 2013 will have the full term of the stock option to exercise 

the accelerated vesting of the outstanding pfizer stock options and the settlement on a prorata basis of other pfizer equity awards resulted in the recognition of additional expense for the year ended december 31 2013 of  9 million  which is included in stockbased compensation the unvested portion of pfizer rsus tsrus and psas were forfeited as of the completion of the exchange offer in the third quarter  of 2013 zoetis made a cash payment of approximately  20 million  to certain nonexecutive zoetis employees based on the value of the employees forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas as applicable this amount is included in the consolidated statement of income as additional compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 members of the zoetis executive team did not receive a cash payment for any forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas but instead in the third quarter of 2013 were granted zoetis rsus which were equivalent in value and vest on the same date as their forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies— estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 10  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 5  acquisitions divestitures and certain investments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 4 significant accounting policies deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and 

37   

uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized 

as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment review we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 

we recorded the following identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable 

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately  138 million  as of december 31 2015 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2015 and 2014 we quantitatively assessed as of september 27 2015 and september 28 2014 respectively the fair value of each of our reporting units using the income approach the fair value of each reporting unit was found to exceed its respective carrying value therefore no impairments were recorded 

38   

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

2015 vs 2014 

total revenue decreased by  20 million  in 2015  compared with 2014  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange decreased revenue by approximately 393 million  or 8  driven by the depreciation of certain international currencies particularly the euro and brazilian real operational revenue grew 373 million or 8  due to growth across both operating segments comprised of 5 volume increases and 3 price increases operational revenue growth was primarily driven by increased revenue in the us as well as brazil china and the united kingdom total livestock sales increased 4  operationally driven by our cattle and swine portfolios growth in sales of cattle products were driven by increased sales in the us and brazil associated with favorable market conditions swine sales increased primarily in china and the us driven by increased sales of vaccines total companion animal sales increased 14  operationally driven by the addition of sales from the acquisition of certain assets of abbott animal health as well as the performance of apoquel ®  and other key brands 

2014 vs 2013 

total revenue increased  224 million  or 5  in 2014  compared with 2013  with growth across both operating segments due to higher operational revenue of  320 million  or 7  comprised of 5 volume and 2 price operational revenue growth was driven by increased revenue in the us and good performance in emerging markets particularly venezuela brazil and china total livestock sales increased 9  operationally driven by strong sales of our cattle swine and poultry portfolios growth in sales of cattle products were driven by increased sales of our premium antiinfective products while sales of swine products were tempered by the effect of pedv total companion animal sales increased 4  operationally driven by the introduction of apoquel ®  in the united states the united kingdom and germany as well as strong performance in latin american countries due to price and volume increases in high inflationary markets and the continued increase in medicalization rates partially offsetting the increase in operational revenue was the unfavorable  impact of foreign exchange which decreased revenue by approximately  96 million  or 2  driven by the depreciation of certain international currencies particularly the brazilian real and argentine peso

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs   



 calculation not meaningful 

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments   

during 2015 we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios changing our selling approach in certain markets and reducing our presence in certain countries and planning to sell or exit certain manufacturing sites over the long term we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with noncustomer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes as part of this initiative we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2000  to 2500  subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries as of december 31 2015 approximately 1200 positions had been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next nine to twelve months 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs 

for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated costs see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 6 restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives  

2015 vs 2014 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs increased  by  295 million  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily as a result of an increase in employee termination costs and asset impairment charges as a result of our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy

2014 vs 2013 

interest expense net of capitalized interest increased  by  4  million or 4 in 2014  compared with 2013  primarily related to an additional month of interest expense in 2014 associated with our senior notes which were issued on january 28 2013 this increase was partially offset by the nonrecurrence of allocated debt and related allocated interest expense from pfizer interest expense related to allocated debt was 2 million for 2013

operating segment results 

in the second quarter of 2015 we changed our segment reporting structure to reflect the way management makes operating decisions we consolidated our prior europeafricamiddle east euafme canadalatin america clar and asiapacific apac operating segments into one operating segment as a result the companys new segment reporting structure consists of two reportable segments the united states and international we also recategorized certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments there has been no change in our total consolidated financial condition or results of operations previously reported as a result of the change in our segment structure the prior period presentation has been revised to reflect the new segment reporting structure 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange

2015 vs 2014   

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased  by 269 million  or 13  in 2015  compared with 2014  of which approximately  88 million  resulted from growth  in livestock products and approximately  181 million  resulted from growth  in companion animal products 

 us segment earnings increased  by  214 million  or 18  in 2015  compared with 2014  due to strong revenue growth and lower operating expenses partially offset by unfavorable product mix 

international operating segment 

international segment revenue decreased  by 290 million  or 11  in 2015  compared with 2014  segment revenue was unfavorably  impacted by foreign exchange which decreased revenue by approximately 389 million  or 15  primarily driven by the depreciation of the euro and the brazilian real 

operational revenue increased   99 million  or 4  reflecting growth  of approximately 49 million  in livestock products and growth  of approximately 50 million  in companion animal products 

 international segment earnings decreased  by 84 million  or 8  in 2015  compared with 2014  operational earnings growth was 100 million  or 10  primarily due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses 

2014 vs 2013   

us operating segment 

us segment revenue increased  by  157 million  or 8  in 2014  compared with 2013  of which approximately  129 million  resulted from growth  in livestock products and approximately  28 million  resulted from growth  in companion animal products 

 us segment earnings increased  by  131 million  or 13  in 2014  compared with 2013  due to strong revenue growth and improved gross margin due to the benefit of higher prices and favorable product mix segment earnings growth also benefited from limited growth in operating expenses 

international operating segment 

international segment revenue increased   70 million  or 3  in 2014  compared with 2013  operational revenue increased   166 million  or 6  reflecting growth  of approximately 134 million  in livestock products and growth  of approximately 32 million  in companion animal products 

 additionally segment revenue was unfavorably  impacted by foreign exchange which decreased revenue by approximately 96 million  or 3  primarily driven by the depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso 

international segment earnings increased  by 76 million  or 8  in 2014  compared with 2013  operational earnings growth was 97 million  or 10  primarily due to higher revenue and limited growth in operating expenses 

46   

other business activities 

other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results as well as expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances us regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products other rdrelated costs associated with nonus market and regulatory activities are generally included in the respective regional segment 

2015 vs 2014 

other business activities net loss declined  by  25 million  or 8  in 2015  compared with 2014  reflecting favorable foreign exchange a decrease in rd spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative and favorable results in our css contract manufacturing business 

2014 vs 2013 

other business activities net loss increased  by 1 million  in 2014  compared with 2013  the increase is driven primarily by higher salaryrelated expenses in our veterinary medicine rd organization partially offset by favorable results in our css contract manufacturing business 

reconciling items 

reconciling items include certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments results such as costs associated with the following 

 2015 vs 2014 

corporate expenses increased by 47 million  or 8  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to an increase in certain compensation costs not charged to our operating segments additional costs associated with the buildup of our enabling functions postseparation from pfizer including higher business technology costs and higher depreciation on assets recently placed in service and higher interest expense net of capitalized interest associated with the additional debt issued in november 2015 these increases are partially offset by savings associated with our operational efficiency initiative lower expenses associated with our business development activities and favorable foreign exchange 

other unallocated expenses decreased by  23 million  or 10  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to favorable foreign exchange partially offset by higher global manufacturing and supply costs 

see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 19 segment geographic and other revenue information  for further information 

2014 vs 2013 

corporate expenses decreased by 4 million  or 1  in 2014  compared with 2013  in 2014 we had additional costs associated with the buildup of our enabling functions postseparation from pfizer as well as higher interest expense net of capitalized interest primarily related to an additional month of interest expense in 2014 associated with our senior notes which were issued on january 28 2013 these increases were offset by a decrease in certain inventoryrelated costs not charged to our operating segments a reduction in sharebased payment expenses as a result of our separation from pfizer and a decrease in certain business technology and finance costs that were reported in corporate in 2013 but are reported in other unallocated  beginning in the first quarter of 2014 

other unallocated expenses increased by 118 million  in 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to a buildup of our supply chain and logistics organization in addition a portion of these costs were reported in the four reportable segments in 2013 but are reported in other unallocated  beginning in the first quarter of 2014 the increase is also attributable to the addition of certain business technology and finance costs that were reported in corporate  in 2013 but are reported in other unallocated  beginning in the first quarter of 2014

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore has limits in its usefulness to investors because of its nonstandardized definition adjusted net income unlike us gaap net income may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the acquisition of the pharmaq business acquired in november 2015 certain assets of abbott animal health acquired in february 2015 kah acquired in 2011 fdah acquired in 2009 and pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction integration and restructuring costs associated with significant business combinations or netasset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

48   

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions significant currency devaluation the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

 analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until realized

operating activities 

2015  vs 2014   

net cash provided by  operating activities was  664 million  in 2015  compared with  626 million  in 2014  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business this increase was partially offset by lower income before allocation to noncontrolling interests as adjusted for depreciation and amortization as well as higher inventory levels and employee termination payments related to our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy 

2014  vs 2013   

net cash provided by  operating activities was  626 million  in 2014  compared with  681 million  in 2013  the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business the settlement of payables with pfizer and a decrease in other liabilities this decrease was partially offset by higher income before allocation to noncontrolling interests as adjusted for depreciation and amortization 

investing activities 

2015  vs 2014   

net cash used in  investing activities was  1115 million  in 2015  compared with  187 million  in 2014  the increase in investing cash flows was   primarily attributable to the acquisitions of pharmaq and of certain assets of abbott animal health 

2014  vs 2013   

net cash used in  investing activities was  187 million  in 2014  compared with  179 million  in 2013  the increase in investing cash flows was primarily due to a 2014 milestone payment related to previously acquired intangible assets

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

as global financial markets continue their slow and sometimes uneven recovery from the 20082009 recession additional macroeconomic business and financial volatility may persist as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow 



 for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets  and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this mda 

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2012 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility which became effective in february 2013 upon the completion of the ipo and which expires in december 2017 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility originally contained a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 4351  for fiscal year 2013 3951  for fiscal year 2014 3501  for fiscal year 2015 and 3001  thereafter on november 2 2015 we amended this financial covenant to increase the maximum total leverage ratio for fiscal 2016 and thereafter from 3001  to 3501 and only upon entering into a material acquisition to 4251 the amended ratio relating to entering into a material acquisition extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition on november 10 2015 we designated the acquisition of pharmaq a material acquisition under the revolving credit agreement for additional information see note 5 acquisitions divestitures and certain investments    the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501  in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2015  there were no  borrowings outstanding as of both december 31 2015  and 2014 

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2015  we had access to 79 million  of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2016 as of december 31 2015  we had 4  million of borrowings outstanding related to these facilities all of which were shortterm as of december 31 2014  we had 7 million  of shortterm borrowings outstanding and  3 million  of longterm borrowings outstanding related to these facilities 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in the united states will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states no accrual for us taxes is provided 

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future

new accounting standards 

for discussion of our new accounting standards see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—new accounting standards  

recently issued accounting standards not adopted as of december 31 2015 

in july 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the measurement of inventory by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market with market being defined as either replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2017 for annual and interim reporting periods the guidance will be adopted prospectively and early adoption is permitted we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2017 the required effective date and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that provides revised guidance on whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships limited liability corporations and securitization structures we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1 2016 the required effective date and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers this update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance includes a fivestep model for determining how when and how much revenue should be recognized this update also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in july 2015 the fasb issued a one year deferral of the effective date the provisions of the new standard are now effective for zoetis beginning january 1 2018 for annual and interim reporting periods early adoption is permitted beginning on january 1 2017 the new standard allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective transition upon adoption we continue to assess the transition method we will elect for adoption as well as the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the euro brazilian real and australian dollar we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instruments at december 31 2015  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2015  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  23 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  30 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 10b financial instruments derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2015  we had no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 10 financial instruments

relationship with pfizer 

on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol “zts” on february 6 2013 an ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares prior to and in connection with the ipo we completed a 365 billion senior notes offering senior notes offering and pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of their animal health business we did not receive any of the proceeds from the ipo we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo on june 24 2013 an exchange offer the exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis we refer to the transactions to separate our business from pfizer as described here and elsewhere in this 2015 annual report as the “separation” for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 2 the separation adjustments associated with the separation senior notes offering initial public offering and exchange offer 

in connection with the ipo and the separation we and pfizer entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer of the agreements summarized below the material agreements are filed as exhibits to this 2015 annual report and the summaries of these agreements set forth the terms of the agreements that we believe are material the summaries below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements 

global separation agreement 

we entered into a global separation agreement with pfizer immediately prior to the completion of the ipo that governs the relationship between pfizer and us following the ipo 

allocation of assets and liabilities notwithstanding the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities that occurred prior to the completion of the separation the global separation agreement generally allocates assets and liabilities to us and pfizer according to the business to which such assets or liabilities relate in general pfizer conveyed leased or licensed to us ownership of all assets that are used exclusively or held for use exclusively in pfizers animal health business and we have assumed all of pfizers historical and future liabilities to the extent relating to arising out of or resulting from the operation of the animal health business whether before on or after the consummation of the ipo including 

 107   

we and pfizer agreed that our cash balance on the date of the completion of the ipo would be at least 300 million 

indemnification  generally each party will indemnify defend and hold harmless the other party and its subsidiaries and each of their affiliates and their respective officers employees and agents from and against any and all losses relating to arising out of or resulting from i liabilities assumed by the indemnifying party and ii any breach by the indemnifying party or its subsidiaries of the global separation agreement and the other agreements described in this section unless such agreement provides for separate indemnification the global separation agreement also specifies procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification 

delayed transfers and further assurances to the extent transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities related to our business were not completed prior to the date of the agreement because of a necessary consent or governmental approval or because a condition precedent to any such transfer was not satisfied or any related relevant fact was not realized the parties agreed to cooperate to effect such transfers or assumptions for agreed upon consideration as promptly as practicable 

each of the parties agreed to cooperate with the other party and use commercially reasonable best efforts to take or to cause to be taken all actions and to do or to cause to be done all things reasonably necessary proper or advisable under applicable law regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the global separation agreement and the other agreements described in this section 

mutual releases  generally each of pfizer and us released the other party from any and all liabilities the liabilities released include liabilities arising under any contract or agreement existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to occur or any conditions existing before the completion of the ipo 

term the global separation agreement will continue unless terminated by us and pfizer although certain rights and obligations terminated upon the completion of the exchange offer 

transitional services agreements 

we entered into a transitional services agreement with pfizer immediately prior to the completion of the ipo that granted us the right to continue to use certain of pfizers services and resources related to our corporate functions such as business technology facilities finance human resources public affairs and procurement we refer to these services and resources collectively as the “pfizer services” 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for the pfizer services which are based on pfizers costs of providing the pfizer services during the two years following the completion of the ipo from february 6 2013 through february 5 2015 the markup for these services was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7 for the services which pfizer continues to provide to zoetis under this agreement a 7 markup applied for 2015 and will apply for the remainder of 2016 we are able to request good faith negotiations of the applicable fees if we believe that the fees materially overcompensate pfizer for any of the pfizer services and pfizer has reciprocal rights if it believes the fees materially under compensate pfizer thirdparty costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost 

under the agreement we are able to use the pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party subject to limited cure periods 

in addition we may from time to time agree to provide to pfizer certain limited reverse transitional services with respect to the continued use of certain assets or resources that pfizer conveyed to us prior to the completion of the ipo to the extent such services are provided pfizer will pay us a mutually agreedupon fee for these services which fee will be based on our costs of providing the service to pfizer 

tax matters agreement

 we are not generally entitled to receive payment from pfizer in respect of any of our tax attributes or tax benefits or any reduction of taxes of pfizer neither partys obligations under the agreement are limited in amount or subject to any cap the agreement also assigns responsibilities for administrative matters such as the filing of returns payment of taxes due retention of records and conduct of audits examinations or similar proceedings in addition the agreement provides for cooperation and information sharing with respect to tax matters 

pfizer is primarily responsible for preparing and filing any tax return with respect to the pfizer affiliated group for us federal income tax purposes and with respect to any consolidated combined unitary or similar group for us state or local or foreign income tax purposes or us state or local nonincome tax purposes that includes pfizer or any of its subsidiaries including those that also include us andor any of our subsidiaries we are generally responsible for preparing and filing any tax returns that include only us andor any of our subsidiaries

our companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development related increases in disposable income and increases in pet ownership and spending on pet care companion animals are also living longer receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 34  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  

in addition our client supply services css organization provides contract manufacturing services to third parties and represented 1 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenue is derived from other product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in complementary areas including diagnostics genetics biodevices and services 

as part of our growth strategy through our research and development rd group we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical and biological entities as well as product lifecycle development historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle development where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede excenel rtu excenel rtu ez excenel naxcel and spectramast 

examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in the past ten years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle development include 

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the united states and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the united states the first fully licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the 

4   

georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry and a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the united states 

in 2014  our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 8  of our revenue the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution and draxxin contributed approximately 21  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 39  of our revenue our product lines and products that represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2014  which comprise 59 of our total revenue are as follows 

livestock products 



5   

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and our products are sold in more than 120 countries operations outside the united states accounted for 57  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india emerging markets contributed 24  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to our international operations  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2014  our sales organization consisted of approximately 3600  employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that typically then sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 11 and 6 respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  and no other customer represented more than 4 of our revenue for the same period

research and development 

our rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development or registration of our products we spent  396 million  in 2014   399 million  in 2013  and  409 million  in 2012  on rd 

our rd efforts are comprised of more than 400 programs and reflect our commitment to better solutions we create new insights for preventing and treating disease and maximizing healthy performance that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation leveraging internal discoveries complemented by diverse external research collaborations results in the delivery of novel vaccine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products to help our customers face their toughest challenges while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd plays a critical role in our growth strategies the majority of our rd investment including regulatory functions is focused on product lifecycle development a commitment to continuous innovation based on customer need ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species more convenient formulations and combinations and by expanding usage into more countries we also create opportunities to optimize solutions through our extensive capabilities in diagnostics and genetics research ensuring we can help our customers diagnose prevent and treat a variety of conditions 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our of research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend without a focus on spending by research stage or by therapeutic area this comprehensive view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle and new product development in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing rd and other industries supports a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process 

prior to the ipo we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer pursuant to which we will maintain access to pfizers proprietary compound library and database to develop new products subject to certain restrictions see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement    in addition we regularly enter into rd collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties 

as of december 31 2014  we employed approximately 1100  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in melbourne australia louvainlaneuve belgium campinas brazil guarulhos brazil olot spain charles city iowa united states and lincoln nebraska united states we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in zaventem belgium são paulo brazil beijing china mumbai india and college park maryland united states and durham north carolina united states we own each of these rd facilities with the exception of our mumbai india facility which we lease from pfizer see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—mumbai india interim lease agreement  each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

many of our research programs involve external partnerships often with funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental direct and indirect expertise in as well as investment for such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 27  sites which utilizes centralized oversight of a system of 13 “anchor” and 14 “satellite” manufacturing sites to maximize cost efficiencies 

7   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 

 we own all of these sites with the exception of our facilities in melbourne australia medolla italy van buren arkansas united states and san diego california united states which are leased sites 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at 11  pfizer sites located in 11 countries pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement included in these 11  pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements   

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2014  this network was comprised of approximately 200  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii their access to niche products and technologies iii capacity and iv financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality and are regularly audited 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites we are currently conducting a review of our global manufacturing and supply network to improve efficiency 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc formerly known as intervetscheringplough merial the animal health division of sanofi sa elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag and boehringer ingelheim animal health the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh in addition we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states unlike in the human health market there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market 

8   

size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

our livestock products tend to experience lower generic competition than our companion animal products for several reasons 

 the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 4800 granted patents and 2000 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with concentration in our major market countries as well as other countries with strong patent systems such as australia brazil canada europe japan and the united states many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own and pfizers work while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were at least partially developed by and are licensed to us by third parties 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods depending on the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained several patents cover the ceftiofur product line including formulation and use patents that begin expiring in the united states in 2015 with others extending until 2024 draxxin and convenia are covered by patents in the united states with terms that expire in 2021 and 2023 respectively the compound patent on doramectin which is the active ingredient in dectomax an antiparasitic expired in all regions however process patents and the injectable formulation patent for this product do not expire in the united states until 2020 and 2016 respectively the compound patent on selamectin which is the active ingredient in revolution a parasiticide expired during 2014 however we have process and formulation patents covering this product expiring in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

in order to facilitate the separation and allow pfizer and our operations to continue with minimal interruption pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a transitional license to use certain of pfizers trademarks and we granted pfizer a transitional license to use certain of our trademarks for a period of time following the completion of the ipo 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 10000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich vich is a trilateral eujapanusa program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration the objectives of the vich are as follows 

 employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had more than 10000  employees worldwide which included approximately 4150  employees in the united states and approximately 5850  in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50  union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2014  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterials resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  

in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the united states over a three year period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian our total revenue attributable to medicated feed additives was approximately 479 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the fda indicated that they took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans zoetis supports the fdas 

12   

efforts to voluntarily phaseout growth promotion indications for medically important antibiotics in food producing animals and will comply with procedures outlined in the december 2013 fda guidance 

in addition in october 2014 the french parliament passed a law that interalia  prohibits rebates and discounts on antibiotics and requires the reporting of antibiotics sold to and agreements entered into with certain animal healthcare providers including veterinarians veterinary schools pharmacists and students the parliament indicated that the law is in response to a government initiative aimed at fighting antimicrobial resistance in animals and reducing the use of certain categories of antibiotics by 25 compared to 2013 by december 31 2016 

we cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition and healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore adverse regulations related directly or indirectly to the use of one or more of our products may injure livestock producers market position more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals such as avian influenza footandmouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes for example the outbreaks of pedv that have seriously impacted swine herds in asia since 2012 and the united states since 2013 spread to additional markets in 2014 including canada mexico japan taiwan spain and portugal the continued spread of pedv in the united states asia europe and neighboring countries could impact the size of swine herds and the demand for our swine products in these markets in addition in 2012 the usda and the world animal health organization announced that individual cases of bse had been identified in california and brazil these announcements caused certain countries to implement additional inspections of or suspend the importation of us and brazilian beef while the restrictions that were implemented as a result of these cases of bse have not significantly affected demand for our products the discovery of additional cases of bse may result in additional restrictions related to or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers have seen recent consolidation in their industries if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

13   

for example the widespread drought that impacted the united states in 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years impacting both the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pasture and resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013 a decrease in harvested corn may result in higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products reduced availability of grazing pasture may also force cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle would result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers for example the economic downturns experienced in many markets across the globe have had an impact on certain of our customers and as a result on our operating results in those affected markets if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet furthermore our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses there are several new startup companies working in the animal health area these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

14   

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products our patent protection for these products extends for varying periods in accordance with the dates of filing or grant and the legal life of patents in countries in which patents are granted the protection afforded by our patents which varies from country to country is limited by the following in the applicable country the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before our patent rights expire and their pricing and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions in addition private label products may compete with our products if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we estimate that approximately 80  of our revenue in 2014 was derived from products that are either unpatented ie never patented or offpatent or covered by our patents that while providing a competitive advantage may not provide market exclusivity over the next several years several of our products patents will expire for example our compound patent on selamectin the active ingredient in revolution and stronghold expired in several countries in january 2014 which could lead to the launch of generic counterparts if generic manufacturers are able to successfully designaround our formulation and process patents 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements 

we are pursuing and will continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets operational revenue growth through new product development and valueadded product lifecycle development improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt and expanding our complementary products and services in addition to base revenue growth we also have historically grown our business through pfizers acquisitions of large pharmaceutical companies that had animal health businesses including the fort dodge animal health fdah business of wyeth and the alpharma animal health business of king pharmaceuticals inc however as a result of the separation we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers acquisition activity we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies including those acquired and those developed internally additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites these risks may be increased by the separation because we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers prior relationships and negotiations relating to such agreements we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers our executive officers are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

15   

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2014 we had goodwill of  976 million  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  727 million  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical combined financial data for the periods prior to the ipo the years ended december 31 2010 2011 and 2012 and the period ended january 31 2013 included in this 2014 annual report does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily the result of the following factors 

 our financial condition and future results of operations will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this 2014 annual report for the periods prior to the ipo as a result of the separation it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business 

as an independent public company we are required to expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not previously apply to us and failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial data 

as an independent public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act and regulations of the nyse such requirements have increased our legal accounting and financial compliance costs have made some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and require additional resources we are devoting significant resources to address these public companyassociated requirements including compliance programs and investor relations as well as our financial reporting obligations complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

in particular as a public company our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls in our annual reports on form 10k in addition we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to auditing standard no 5 beginning with this 2014 annual report if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle developments 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

16   

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research in addition to the rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer we expect to enter into other collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities we have a global manufacturing network consisting of 27  manufacturing sites located in 10  countries in addition 11  pfizer sites located in 11  countries manufacture certain of our products for us included in these pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time these pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products we also employ a network of approximately 200  cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

17   

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is commonly abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development manufacturing and distribution processes counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening to animals our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products sold under our brand name in addition products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory warehouses plants or while in transit which are not properly stored or which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact animal health and safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines andor pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims for example as a result of safety concerns related to our product pregsure bvd in 2010 we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu and in 2011 we suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in new zealand also in may 2013 we were advised that the european commission started a procedure regarding the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv a vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 in swine the initiation of the procedure followed a recall of two batches of suvaxyn pcv as a result of higher than expected adverse reactions reported mainly in spain in june 2013 we completed a root cause investigation of the higher than expected adverse reactions in these two batches and subsequently submitted to the ema a proposed variation to describe specific adjustments to the manufacturing process to help minimize the risk of future reactive batches in october 2013 the ema’s committee on medicinal products for veterinary use adopted a positive opinion as to the proposed variation and concurrently adopted an opinion concluding that no action was required at that time with regard to the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv both opinions were transmitted to the european commission according to the applicable procedure and the commission officially advised us in january 2014 that it had adopted those positive opinions and concluded the procedure begun in may 2013 by maintaining the marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv in effect 

18   

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

as a global company we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations including regulations relating to the development quality assurance manufacturing importation distribution marketing and sale of our products in addition our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements allegations of such noncompliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in among other things inspection observation notices warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence fines a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market and civil or criminal prosecution as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals in connection with the separation we will likely change the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and because of these changes may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

furthermore we cannot predict the nature of future laws regulations or changes in tax laws challenges brought against our incentive tax rulings and tariffs nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies absent a clear understanding of these anomalies regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

our failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 19   

 in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized reimportation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other traderelated sanctions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2014 we generated approximately 53  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro australian dollar and brazilian real we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss of 9 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local assets and liabilities which is included in other incomedeductions—net for the year ended december 31 2013 

our venezuelan subsidiarys functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government expanded its exchange mechanisms resulting in three official rates of exchange for the venezuelan bolivar as of december 31 2014 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the cencoex rate of 63 the sicad i rate of 120 and the sicad ii rate of 4999 we continue to use the cencoex rate of 63 to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience adverse impacts to earnings as our revenue costs and expenses may be translated into us dollars at lower rates these impacts are not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations as of november 30 2014 we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of 56 million in venezuela and other consolidated entities had receivables from our venezuela business of 37 million for the year ended november 30 2014 our revenue from the venezuelan market was approximately 77 million these amounts may grow in the future 

on february 10 2015 the venezuelan government announced that they would continue to operate with a threetier exchange rate system and that the primary rate of 63 bolivars to the dollar would remain in place for imports that are deemed essential a new freefloating rate simadi will replace the existing thirdtier rate sicad ii we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar or whether our use of the 63 rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances further other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela which could result in an impairment charge and under extreme circumstances could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically 

20   

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and venezuela and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets including by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america have been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations for all these and other reasons sales within emerging markets carry significant risks 

risks related to tax matters 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 

for example the european commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain european countries including belgium comply with european union rules on state aid the outcome of the european commission’s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that in turn could have an impact on the company’s taxes in addition our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the united states or other material foreign jurisdictions or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

the actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of litigation we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such claims the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if 

21   

we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition patent law reform in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance in september 2011 the united states enacted the america invents act which will permit enhanced thirdparty actions for challenging patents and will implement a firsttoinvent system in april 2012 australia enacted the intellectual property laws amendment raising the bar act which provides higher standards for obtaining patents similarly in 2012 argentina enacted new regulations regarding the patentability of formulations methods and processes which raises the standards for such patents in september 2013 the brazilian patent office challenged the validity and term of the socalled “mailbox patents” of pharmaceutical and veterinary companies which were filed in the interim period before brazil fully implemented the traderelated aspects of intellectual property right trips agreements patentability standards the action of the brazilian patent office potentially could shorten the duration or invalidate some of our patents we have filed an appeal but the decision will not be known for several years these reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations to process transmit and store electronic and financial information and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner which could harm our ability to conduct business hurt our relationships with our customers or delay our financial reporting such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the ipo and the separation we have substantially changed a number of our business processes including our financial reporting and supply chain processes in order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with pfizer we have made significant configuration and data changes within some of our information technology systems if our information and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes our financial 

22   

reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and our operations may be adversely affected and as a result our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

in addition we are implementing new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning erp system to better integrate our manufacturing financial commercial and business operations there is risk associated with ensuring that the milestones timelines and budget associated with these new systems stay on track transitioning to new systems integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions including from circumstances beyond our control affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed unreliable corrupted insufficient or inaccessible any of these potential issues individually or in aggregation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

even if we are able to implement these systems successfully all information systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information systems were to fail or be breached such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may experience difficulties with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an erp the erp is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the implementation of the erp will require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties while we have invested significant resources in planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues may arise any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone service or power outages failures of the information systems that support our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure 

our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack cyberattacks   are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments industrial espionage the deployment of harmful malware denialofservice and other means to threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability a successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for our company including the disruption of operations the misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans like other global companies we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems to date those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition however although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems we expect cyberattacks to continue and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business legal or reputational harm to us or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be unable to adequately protect our customers privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws could result in lost sales remediation costs legal liability including severe penalties regulatory action and reputational harm   despite our considerable efforts and investments in technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition the payment card industry pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 36 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we have entered into an agreement 

23   

for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the pfizerowned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo as a result of these and other factors we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any 

24   

announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all these expected benefits include the following 

 we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation for a variety of reasons which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

pfizer may compete with us 

pfizer is not restricted from competing with us in the animal health business including as a result of acquiring a company that operates an animal health business due to the significant resources of pfizer including financial resources name recognition and knowhow resulting from the previous management of our business pfizer could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to engage in the type of business we conduct which may cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 and using our common stock to make acquisitions in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence — relationship with pfizer — tax matters agreement 

we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of our rd agreement with pfizer 

prior to the separation as a business unit of pfizer we had the ability to leverage pfizers proprietary compound library and database to identify research and develop compounds suitable as new product candidates for the animal health field as part of the separation we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer which is referred to as the “rd agreement” pursuant to the rd agreement subject to certain restrictions we have continued access to pfizers compound library and database for a period of seven years from the date of the ipo and have subject to pfizers approval the possibility to exclusively license compounds from pfizer that we develop under the rd agreement 

while the rd agreement is intended to supplement our postseparation rd capabilities certain terms of the rd agreement may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit including 

 each of the foregoing terms and pfizers other rights under the rd agreement and related licenses if any could limit our ability to realize the expected benefits of the rd agreement if we fail to achieve the expected benefits of the rd agreement it may be more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products 

25   

for a summary description of the terms of the rd collaboration and license agreement see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence— relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult timeconsuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

for a summary description of the terms of the patent and knowhow license pfizer as licensor see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—intellectual property license agreements 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant charges in connection with the separation and incremental costs as an independent public company 

prior to the separation pfizer performed or supported many important corporate functions for our company our combined financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis following the separation many of these services are governed by our transitional services agreement with pfizer under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party upon prior written notice subject to limited cure periods 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for these services based on pfizers costs of providing the services during the two years following the ipo the markup for these services was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7 for the services that pfizer continues to provide to zoetis under this agreement a 7 markup will apply for the remainder of 2015 we believe this markup is consistent with arms length pricing for the services provided however since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parentsubsidiary relationship the terms of the agreement including the fees charged for the services may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arms length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical financial statements thirdparty costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost in addition while these services are being provided to us by pfizer our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited 

we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate thirdparty agreements on terms and conditions including cost comparable to those that we receive from pfizer under our transitional services agreement additionally after the agreement terminates we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from pfizer when we begin to operate these functions separately if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or are unable to obtain them from other providers we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs and our profitability may decline 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2014 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2814 on april 15 2014 to a high sales price of 4524 on december 1 2014 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2014 annual report are 

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 17 2014 our board of directors declared the 2015 first quarter dividend of 0083 per share to be paid on march 3 2015 to holders of record on january 22 2015 and on february 27 2015 our board of directors declared the 2015 second quarter dividend of 0083 per share to be paid on june 2 2015 to holders of record on april 9 2015 although we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws shareholder rights plan and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” our amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

we are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business these claims and litigation may include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition law labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort we operate in multiple jurisdictions and as a result a claim in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatory penalties in other jurisdictions we intend to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation 

at this time in the opinion of management the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results of operations financial condition or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved in addition regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes such matters are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation even if resolved in our favor 

certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies

market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

tableend on january 31 2013 our registration statement on form s1 file no 333183254 was declared effective for the ipo pursuant to which we registered the offering and sale of 99015000 shares of our class a common stock including 12915000 additional shares pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the ipo was completed on february 6 2013 at a public offering price of 2600 per share for an aggregate gross offering price of approximately 257 billion 

instead of selling shares of our class a common stock directly to the underwriters for cash in the ipo pfizer first exchanged the shares of our class a common stock to be sold in the ipo with certain of the underwriters which we refer to in such role as the “debtforequity exchange parties” for outstanding indebtedness of pfizer held by the debtforequity exchange parties the debtforequity exchange parties then sold shares to the underwriters for cash this debtforequity exchange occurred on the settlement date of the ipo immediately prior to the settlement of the debtforequity exchange parties sale of the shares to the underwriters 

we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the debtforequity exchange parties including any shares sold by the debtforequity exchange parties in connection with the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares 

on june 24 2013 an exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis and the conversion of all outstanding shares of class b common stock to shares of our class a common stock which we now refer to as our common stock there are no shares of class b outstanding 

shares of our common stock are traded on the nyse symbol zts 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales price of our common stock for each quarter presented below 



as of february 23 2015  there were 500787817  shares of our common stock outstanding held by 2165 shareholders of record information about 5 beneficial owners of our common stock is incorporated by reference from the discussion under the heading ownership of our common stock  in our 2015 proxy statement 

additional information relating to our common stock is included in this annual report on form 10k in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 15 stockholders’ equity  

purchases of equity securities by the issuer 

on november 18 2014 we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of our outstanding common stock this program does not have a stated expiration date purchases of zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management depending on market conditions and business needs we repurchase shares pursuant to rules 10b51 and 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended through repurchase agreements established with several brokers no share repurchases were made under this program during the year ended december 31 2014 

29   

issuer purchases of equity securities for the three months ended december 31 2014 were as follows 



a  the company repurchased 951 shares during the threemonth period ended december 31 2014 that were not part of the publicly announced share repurchase authorization these shares were purchased from employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares from equitybased awards 

dividend policy declaration and payment 

during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we paid the following quarterly cash dividends per share on our common stock 



we expect to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock subject to the approval of our board of directors on december 17 2014 our board of directors declared the 2015 first quarter dividend of 0083  per share to be paid on march 3 2015 to holders of record on january 22 2015 on february 27 2015 our board of directors declared the 2015 second quarter dividend of 0083 per share to be paid on june 2 2015 to holders of record on april 9 2015 

the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends therefore no assurance is given that we will pay any dividends to our common stockholders or as to the amount of any such dividends if our board of directors determines to do so 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock will depend on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from certain of our subsidiaries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains a description of our historical performance for periods in which we operated as a business unit of pfizer as well as forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and in the forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  and comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer  sections of this mda 

this mda is organized as follows 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 60 years as a business unit of pfizer and now as an independent public company we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

the animal health medicines and vaccines industry is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions as a result of these differences among other things we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs our four operating segments are the united states us europeafricamiddle east euafme canadalatin america 

33   

clar and asiapacific apac see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  

we directly market our products to livestock producers and veterinarians located in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole emerging markets contributed 24  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in the industry’s largest sales organization including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers additionally our management team’s focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing longterm value for our shareholders 

a summary of our 2014 performance compared to the comparable 2013 and 2012 periods follows 



 our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry sheep and fish livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses health professionals indicate that companion animals improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of pet owners factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle developments the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle development which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health medicines and vaccines customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

34   

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration topical oral intramuscularsubcutaneous injections or intravenous these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take restrictive actions even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  

in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the united states over a three year period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian we believe the impact of this fda guidance on our financial performance will not be significant based on the overall diversity and breadth of our product portfolio of medicines vaccines and diagnostics serving eight core species 

in addition in october 2014 the french parliament passed a law that interalia  prohibits rebates and discounts on antibiotics and requires the reporting of antibiotics sold to and agreements entered into with certain animal healthcare providers including veterinarians veterinary schools pharmacists and students the parliament indicated that the law is in response to a government initiative aimed at fighting antimicrobial resistance in animals and reducing the use of certain categories of antibiotics by 25 compared to 2013 by december 31 2016 

we cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses face challenges related to global economic conditions growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets in recent years certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns which decreased the demand for our products and in some cases hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impact of recent downturns in the global economy further economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers which may result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other severe weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions the widespread drought which impacted parts of the united states during 2011 2012 and 2013 was considered the worst in many years and affected our performance in the us market in 2012 and in the first half of 2013 

35   

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase 

for example since the second quarter of 2013 some producers in the united states have experienced an outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv pedv has existed in parts of asia for many years it is important to note that the virus which affects piglets does not create a food safety issue we are committed to supporting pork producers in understanding and controlling pedv and we are partnering with the key stakeholders including various academic institutions such as the university of minnesota and iowa state university in september 2014 the us department of agriculture usda granted us a conditional license for a vaccine to help fight pedv in order to receive the conditional license we had to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine in a field study and provide a reasonable expectation of the vaccine’s efficacy we began supplying the vaccine to veterinarians and pig farmers in september 2014 and we are working to complete the efficacy and potency studies necessary to obtain full licensure in the united states from the usda since first reported in the united states in 2013 pedv has spread and has now been reported in at least 33 us states as well as in canada mexico and parts of south america according to recent reports during 2014 the outbreak impacted up to 50 of the sows in the united states and up to onethird of the sows in mexico furthermore during the first half of 2014 active cases of pedv were reported in several new markets in asia including japan south korea and taiwan and in the second half of 2014 active cases of the disease were confirmed in spain and portugal although many of the farms that were previously infected have since returned to normal production the virus continues to pose a threat to the swine industry we currently believe the impact of pedv on our 2015 revenue will not be significant however we are closely monitoring the evolution of this ongoing outbreak and its impact on the swine industry and on our 2015 revenue 

in addition beginning in 2013 there have been several reported cases of the h7n9 avian influenza virus in china in late march 2013 the chinese government reported the first case of the h7n9 avian influenza virus since that time approximately 450 cases have been detected we are closely monitoring the developments as this situation unfolds and currently believe the impact on our 2015 global revenue will not be significant while china continues to represent a growth opportunity for us sales in china represented approximately 2 of our total revenue in 2014 and the majority was generated by our swine business 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 120 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in 2014  approximately 53  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the brazilian real the australian dollar and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances in 2014  approximately 47  of our total revenue was in us dollars our yearoveryear revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 2  percentage points from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss of 9 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local assets and liabilities which is included in other incomedeductions—net for the year ended december 31 2013 

our venezuelan subsidiarys functional currency is the us dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government expanded its exchange mechanisms resulting in three official rates of exchange for the venezuelan bolivar as of december 31 2014 the venezuelan bolivar to us dollar exchange rates were the cencoex rate of 63 the sicad i rate of 120 and the sicad ii rate of 4999 we continue to use the cencoex rate of 63 to report our venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience adverse impacts to earnings as our revenue costs and expenses may be translated into us dollars at lower rates these impacts are not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations as of november 30 2014 we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of 56 million in venezuela and other consolidated entities had receivables from our venezuela business of 37 million for the year ended november 30 2014 our revenue from the venezuelan market was approximately 77 million these amounts may grow in the future 

on february 10 2015 the venezuelan government announced that they would continue to operate with a threetier exchange rate system and that the primary rate of 63 bolivars to the dollar would remain in place for imports that are deemed essential a new freefloating rate simadi will replace the existing thirdtier rate sicad ii we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar or whether our use of the 63 rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances further other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela which could result in an impairment charge and under extreme circumstances could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically 

certain regulatory matters 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies an inspector may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements the fda provides notice of these observations in a form 483 in january 2015 the fda conducted inspections at three of our manufacturing facilities after which the fda issued form 483s to the company in connection with two of these inspections we responded to the fda and are in the process of addressing the observations in the form 483s we cannot give any assurances that the fda will be satisfied with our responses to their form 483 observations or as to the expected date of resolution of observations included in the form 

36   

483s in october 2014 we received a letter from the usda’s center for veterinary biologicals cvb requesting that we meet with the cvb to discuss compliance issues at certain of our us sites that manufacture biological products we have met with the cvb to discuss the cvb’s specific concerns and to present a plan for certain corrective and preventive actions we are implementing that plan we cannot give any assurances that the usda will be satisfied with the progress of our corrective and preventive actions and not take further regulatory action affecting our usda establishment license

comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer 

during the periods prior to the ipo covered by the combined financial statements in this 2014  annual report we operated solely as a business unit of pfizer the related combined financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pfizer and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the animal health business of pfizer these combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent public company during the periods presented in addition the historical combined financial statements may not be reflective of what our results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows might be in the future as an independent public company 

for a detailed description of the basis of presentation and an understanding of the limitations of the predictive value of the historical combined financial statements see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 3 basis of presentation 

our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future as an independent public company with respect to support functions for example for the periods prior to the ipo our historical combined financial statements include expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within pfizer such as expenses for business technology facilities legal finance human resources and to a lesser extent business development public affairs and procurement among others as part of the separation pursuant to agreements with pfizer pfizer provides us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreedupon fees and we are incurring other costs to replace the services and resources that will not be provided by pfizer as an independent public company our total costs related to such support functions may differ from the costs that were historically allocated to us from pfizer 

we have also incurred certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming an independent public company including new branding which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure the accelerated vesting of certain pfizer equity awards and associated cash payment related thereto site separation and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs 

some of our products are manufactured at sites that were retained by pfizer or that are operated by pfizer under a saleleaseback arrangement in 2013 pursuant to the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer we began purchasing these products from pfizer under the master manufacturing and supply agreement our supply price is pfizers costs plus a percentage markup subject to limited exceptions during the two years following the completion of the ipo from february 6 2013 through february 5 2015 the markup was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement the markup will be 15 the cost of each pfizersupplied product is subject to annual review the historical combined statements of income for the periods prior to the ipo include allocations of certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by the manufacturing sites that would not have been charged to us under the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer had such agreement been in effect in the periods presented such as operating variances as well as purchase price and volume variances under a certain threshold the costs allocated in the historical combined statements of income are higher than the amounts that would have been charged by pfizer under the master manufacturing and supply agreement had it been in effect during the periods presented by approximately 10 million for the year ended december 31 2012 in connection with the ipo we and pfizer have entered into certain agreements that will provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 19b transactions and agreements with pfizer—agreements with pfizer 

following the ipo the equity awards previously granted to our employees by pfizer continued to vest and service with zoetis counted as service with pfizer for equity award purposes on june 24 2013 pfizer completed the exchange offer whereby pfizer disposed of all shares of zoetis common stock owned by pfizer pfizer accelerated the vesting of and in some cases the settlement of on a prorata basis outstanding pfizer restricted stock units rsus total shareholder return units tsrus and performance share awards psas previously granted to our employees subject in each case to the requirements of section 409a of the us internal revenue code the terms of the 2004 pfizer stock plan and the applicable award agreements and any outstanding deferral elections in addition unvested pfizer stock options previously granted to our employees accelerated in full and our employees generally have the ability to exercise the stock options until the earlier of i june 23 2016 three years from pfizers completion of the exchange offer ii termination of their employment from zoetis or iii the expiration date of the stock option zoetis employees who held pfizer stock options and were retirement eligible as of june 24 2013 will have the full term of the stock option to exercise 

the accelerated vesting of the outstanding pfizer stock options and the settlement on a prorata basis of other pfizer equity awards resulted in the recognition of additional expense for the year ended december 31 2013 of  9 million  which is included in stockbased compensation the unvested portion of pfizer rsus tsrus and psas were forfeited as of the completion of the exchange offer in the third quarter  of 2013 zoetis made a cash payment of approximately  20 million  to certain nonexecutive zoetis employees based on the value of the employees forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas as applicable this amount is included in the consolidated statement of income as additional compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 members of the zoetis executive team did not receive a cash payment for any forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas but instead in the third quarter of 2013 were granted zoetis rsus which were equivalent in value and vest on the same date as their forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas 

public company expenses 

as a result of the ipo we became subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act we have established additional procedures and practices as an independent public company as a result we are incurring additional costs including but not limited to internal audit investor relations stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 

recent significant acquisitions and governmentmandated divestitures 

the assets liabilities operating results and cash flows of acquired businesses are included in our results commencing from their respective acquisition dates 

on november 17 2014 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase animal health assets of abbott for a purchase price of 255 million on february 10 2015 after satisfying all customary closing conditions including clearance under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act we completed the purchase of certain assets of abbott animal health the purchase price includes a 230 million cash payment 

38   

on the date of closing and a contingent payment of 25 million to be paid within one year of closing if certain product supply conditions are met abbott animal health is a companion animal health business focused on the veterinary surgical suite the final allocation of the purchase price amongst assets liabilities and goodwill is subject to final valuation 

delays in establishing new operating subsidiaries 

due to local regulatory and operational requirements in certain nonus jurisdictions the transfer to us of certain assets and liabilities of pfizers animal health business had not yet legally occurred as of the ipo date these assets and liabilities were not material to our consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate as of december 31 2013 all expected subsidiaries had been established and the related assets and liabilities had transferred 

agreements with pfizer 

on february 6 2013 we entered into a transitional services agreement with pfizer whereby pfizer agreed to provide us with various corporate support services this agreement has a service commencement date of january 1 2013 in the united states and december 1 2012 for our international locations in addition on october 1 2012 we entered into a master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer on october 1 2012 whereby we and pfizer agreed to manufacture and supply products to each other commencing january 1 2013 see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 19b transactions and agreements with pfizer—agreements with pfizer for more information related to these and other agreements including the related costs 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated and combined financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies— estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 9  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are heavily dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 4 significant accounting policies—deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

39   

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend heavily on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized 

as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment review we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 

we recorded the following identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable 

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately  2 million  as of december 31 2014 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment 

factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed 

when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach which is forwardlooking and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then apply a reporting unit 

40   

specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

in 2014 we quantitatively assessed as of september 28 2014 the fair value of each of our reporting units using the income approach the fair value of each reporting unit was found to exceed its respective carrying value therefore no impairments were recorded 

in 2013 we qualitatively assessed as of september 29 2013 whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying amounts including goodwill based on that assessment we determined that this condition did not exist for all reporting units and performing a quantitative fair value test for our reporting units was not necessary as a result we did not believe that the risk of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units was significant at that time 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and information that may affect future results

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs   



certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments   

 during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of 12 million  related to employee severance costs in euafme and 6 million  related to employee severance costs in our global manufacturing operations as a result of initiatives to reduce costs and better align our organizational structure we may incur additional restructuring costs in 2015 as we finalize plans and programs aimed at improving operational and cost efficiencies 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 when we were a business unit of pfizer we announced a restructuring plan related to our operations in europe in connection with these actions we recorded a pretax charge of 27 million  to recognize employee termination costs as a result of becoming a standalone public company no longer being a majorityowned subsidiary of pfizer and related economic consideration we revisited this 

44   

restructuring action and decided to no longer implement this restructuring plan as such we reversed the existing reserve of 27 million  in the second quarter of 2013 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily related to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future as well as integration costs the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs

 provision for taxes on income 



certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

as of the separation date we operate under a standalone legal entity structure and the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income has been calculated accordingly for the periods prior to the separation the income tax provision in the combined statements of income has been calculated as if zoetis filed a separate tax return and includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

the impact of the incentive tax rulings in belgium effective december 1 2012 through 2017 and singapore effective october 29 2012 through 2016 continue to be a component of the 2014 effective tax in rate these incentive tax rulings may be extended for another 5 and 6 years respectively if certain requirements are met 

on december 19 2014 the president of the united states signed into law the tax increase prevention act of 2014 the 2014 act which extended the us research and development tax credit for tax year 2014 as well as other provisions given the enactment date of the 2014 act the impact of the 2014 us research and development tax credit is included in the 2014 effective tax rate 

during the third quarter of 2012 pfizer reached a settlement with the us internal revenue service irs with respect to the audits of the pfizer inc tax returns for the years 2006 through 2008 the settlement resulted in an income tax benefit to zoetis of approximately 293 million representing tax and interest

 operating segment results 

in the first quarter of 2014 we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our client supply services css organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties to reflect how our chief operating decision maker currently evaluates our financial results the revenue and earnings associated with css are now reported within other business activities  separate from our four reportable segments in 2013 and 2012 css results were reported in the euafme segment the current presentation of segments is more reflective of our commercial business since css operates differently from our commercial operations within the geographic segments css revenue for 2013 was 53 million livestock  15 million companion animal  38 million css revenue for 2012 was 28 million livestock  11 million companion animal  17 million css earnings loss for 2013 and 2012 were 8 million and 1 million respectively we have revised our segment results presented herein to reflect this new segment structure including for the comparable 2013 and 2012 periods 

we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth but also “operational growth” operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore has limits in its usefulness to investors because of its nonstandardized definition adjusted net income unlike us gaap net income may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 fdah acquired in 2009 and kah acquired in 2011 include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

51   

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction integration restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with significant business combinations or netasset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities

analysis of the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive income 

substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until realized

for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents  shortterm borrowing including current portion of allocated long term debt  and longterm debt  see analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources below 

accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts decreased primarily as a result of the timing of customer collections the settlement of receivables from pfizer and the impact of foreign exchange these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements—  note 19 transactions and agreements with pfizer 

inventories  decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange the decrease was partially offset by increases related to certain production transfers and to support increased commercial demand of selected products see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 10 inventories   

the net changes in current deferred tax assets  noncurrent deferred tax assets  noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  and other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2014 see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 8 tax matters   

property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation  increased primarily as a result of capital spending in excess of depreciation expense

operating activities 

2014  vs 2013   

net cash provided by  operating activities was  626 million  in 2014  compared with  681 million  in 2013  the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business the settlement of payables with pfizer and a decrease in other liabilities this decrease was partially offset by higher income before allocation to noncontrolling interests as adjusted for depreciation and amortization 

56   

2013  vs 2012   

net cash provided by  operating activities was  681 million  in 2013  compared with  454 million  in 2012  and was primarily attributable to income before allocation to noncontrolling interests as adjusted for depreciation and amortization the net change in operating assets and liabilities net of acquisitions and divestitures and transfers with pfizer was primarily driven by an increase in other liabilities reflecting higher accrued interest on longterm debt and higher accrued compensation partially offset by higher inventory levels in addition net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the timing and of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 

investing activities 

2014  vs 2013   

net cash used in  investing activities was  187 million  in 2014  compared with  179 million  in 2013  the increase in investing cash flows was primarily due to a 2014 milestone payment related to previously acquired intangible assets 

2013  vs 2012   

net cash used in  investing activities was  179 million  in 2013  compared with  135 million  in 2012  primarily due to increased capital investment in property plant and equipment

net cash used in  financing activities was  154 million  in 2014  compared with  200 million  in 2013  the net cash used in financing activities for 2014 was due primarily to the payment of dividends the net cash used in financing activities for 2013 was primarily attributable to the net transfers to pfizer as a result of the separation 

2013  vs 2012   

net cash used in  financing activities was  200 million  in 2013  compared with  78 million  in 2012  the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the net transfers to pfizer as a result of the ipo and an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by net proceeds from longterm and shortterm borrowings 

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

as global financial markets continue their slow and sometimes uneven recovery from the 20082009 recession additional macroeconomic business and financial volatility may persist as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing

credit facility and other lines of credit 

in december 2012 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility which became effective in february 2013 upon the completion of the ipo and which expires in december 2017 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 4351  for fiscal year 2013 3951  for fiscal year 2014 3501  for fiscal year 2015 and 3001  thereafter the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501  in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2014  there were no  borrowings outstanding as of both december 31 2014  and 2013 

we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2014  we had access to 74 million  of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2016 as of december 31 2014  we had 7 million  of shortterm borrowings outstanding and  3 million  of longterm borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31 2013  we had 15 million  of shortterm borrowings outstanding and  2 million  of longterm borrowings outstanding related to these facilities 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in the us will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of us and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states no accrual for us taxes is provided 

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

contractual obligations   

payments due under contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 are set forth below 



certain amounts may reflect rounding adjustments 

 the table above excludes amounts for potential milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years andor which may never occur our contractual obligations in the table above are not necessarily indicative of our contractual obligations in the future

two major corporate debtrating organizations moodys and sp assign ratings to our shortterm and longterm debt a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured noncreditenhanced longterm debt 



pension obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental tax employee andor productrelated matters and patentinfringement claims if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification we would be required to reimburse the loss these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations historically we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013 recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant 

new accounting standards 

for discussion of our new accounting standards see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—new accounting standards  

recently issued accounting standards not adopted as of december 31 2014 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers this update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance includes a fivestep model for determining how when and how much revenue should be recognized this update also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1 2017 for annual and interim reporting periods early adoption is not permitted the new standard allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective transition upon adoption we are currently assessing the transition method we will elect for adoption as well as the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the euro brazilian real and australian dollar we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instruments at december 31 2014  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies —  fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2014  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would increase by  25 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  21 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 9b financial instruments —  derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2014  we had no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 9 financial instruments

in connection with the ipo and the separation we and pfizer entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer of the agreements summarized below the material agreements are filed as exhibits to this 2014 annual report and the summaries of these agreements set forth the terms of the agreements that we believe are material the summaries below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements 

global separation agreement 

we entered into a global separation agreement with pfizer immediately prior to the completion of the ipo that governs the relationship between pfizer and us following the ipo 

allocation of assets and liabilities notwithstanding the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities that occurred prior to the completion of the separation the global separation agreement generally allocates assets and liabilities to us and pfizer according to the business to which such assets or liabilities relate in general pfizer conveyed leased or licensed to us ownership of all assets that are used exclusively or held for use exclusively in pfizers animal health business and we have assumed all of pfizers historical and future liabilities to the extent relating to arising out of or resulting from the operation of the animal health business whether before on or after the consummation of the ipo including 

 108   

we and pfizer agreed that our cash balance on the date of the completion of the ipo would be at least 300 million 

indemnification  generally each party will indemnify defend and hold harmless the other party and its subsidiaries and each of their affiliates and their respective officers employees and agents from and against any and all losses relating to arising out of or resulting from i liabilities assumed by the indemnifying party and ii any breach by the indemnifying party or its subsidiaries of the global separation agreement and the other agreements described in this section unless such agreement provides for separate indemnification the global separation agreement also specifies procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification 

delayed transfers and further assurances to the extent transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities related to our business were not completed prior to the date of the agreement because of a necessary consent or governmental approval or because a condition precedent to any such transfer was not satisfied or any related relevant fact was not realized the parties agreed to cooperate to effect such transfers or assumptions for agreed upon consideration as promptly as practicable 

each of the parties agreed to cooperate with the other party and use commercially reasonable best efforts to take or to cause to be taken all actions and to do or to cause to be done all things reasonably necessary proper or advisable under applicable law regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the global separation agreement and the other agreements described in this section 

mutual releases  generally each of pfizer and us released the other party from any and all liabilities the liabilities released include liabilities arising under any contract or agreement existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to occur or any conditions existing before the completion of the ipo 

term the global separation agreement will continue unless terminated by us and pfizer although certain rights and obligations terminated upon the completion of the exchange offer 

transitional services agreements 

we entered into a transitional services agreement with pfizer immediately prior to the completion of the ipo that granted us the right to continue to use certain of pfizers services and resources related to our corporate functions such as business technology facilities finance human resources public affairs and procurement we refer to these services and resources collectively as the “pfizer services” 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for the pfizer services which are based on pfizers costs of providing the pfizer services during the two years following the completion of the ipo from february 6 2013 through february 5 2015 the markup for these services was 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7 for the services which pfizer continues to provide to zoetis under this agreement a 7 markup will apply for the remainder of 2015 we are able to request good faith negotiations of the applicable fees if we believe that the fees materially overcompensate pfizer for any of the pfizer services and pfizer has reciprocal rights if it believes the fees materially under compensate pfizer thirdparty costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost 

under the agreement we are able to use the pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party subject to limited cure periods 

in addition we may from time to time agree to provide to pfizer certain limited reverse transitional services with respect to the continued use of certain assets or resources that pfizer conveyed to us prior to the completion of the ipo to the extent such services are provided pfizer will pay us a mutually agreedupon fee for these services which fee will be based on our costs of providing the service to pfizer

our livestock products primarily help prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important longterm growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first population growth and increasing standards of living drive increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food safety livestock products represented approximately 64  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 

our companion animal products improve the quality of and extend the life of pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of care they provide growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development and related increases in disposable income increasing pet ownership companion animals living longer increasing medical treatment of companion animals and advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 36  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 

our major product categories are 

 2   

our remaining revenue is derived from other product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products and services in complementary areas including diagnostics genetics devices dairy data management elearning and professional consulting 

as part of our growth strategy through our rd group we focus on both product lifecycle development and new chemical and biological entities historically a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle development for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease brd in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede excenel rtu excenel rtu ez excenel naxcel and spectramast 

examples of our firstinclass andor bestinclass products that we have launched in the past ten years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle development include 

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the united states and european union the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the united states and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help reduce disease caused by the georgia 08 variant of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry 

in 2013 our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 7  of our revenue the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution and draxxin contributed approximately 20  of our revenue our top ten product lines contributed 39  of our revenue our product lines and products that represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2013 are as follows

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and our products are sold in more than 120 countries operations outside of the united states accounted for 58  of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india emerging markets contributed 26  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to our international operations  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to inform promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use and generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2013 our sales organization consisted of approximately 3500  employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork poultry and aquaculture operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that typically then sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 11 and 6 respectively of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 and no other customer represented more than 4 of our revenue for the same period

research and development 

our research and development rd operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine rd organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development or registration of our products we spent  399 million  in 2013  409 million  in 2012 and  427 million  in 2011 on rd 

while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd continues to play an important role in our growth strategies the majority of our rd investment is focused on product lifecycle development new product rd leverages discoveries of agribusiness academia and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology rd organizations our product lifecycle development leverages our existing product portfolio to expand our product lines by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new countries and creating new combinations and reformulations two factors  the allocation of our rd investment between product lifecycle development and new product research and development and our ability to leverage both the discoveries of other industries and of our existing rd  generally leads to a costeffective efficient sustainable and relatively predictable rd process in addition our other rd activities include the development of branded generic products genetics and diagnostics as well as biodevices and engineering investments for in ovo  applications 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of alignment of research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business we make our strategic investments in rd based on four criteria strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio technical feasibility of development and manufacture return on investment and the needs of customers and the market a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend without a focus on spending by research stage or by therapeutic area this comprehensive view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency 

prior to the ipo we entered into a rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer pursuant to which we will maintain access to pfizers proprietary compound library and database to develop new products subject to certain restrictions see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement    in addition we are pursuing opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 1100  employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in melbourne australia louvainlaneuve belgium guarulhos brazil olot spain charles city iowa us and lincoln nebraska us we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintain rd operations in zaventem belgium são paulo brazil mumbai india and college park maryland us and durham north carolina us as part of the separation pfizer conveyed to us its interest in each of these rd facilities with the exception of our mumbai india facility which we expect pfizer to transfer to us for agreed upon cash consideration and in the interim we lease the facility from pfizer see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—mumbai india interim lease agreement  each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

many of our research programs involve an external partnership often with funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental direct and indirect expertise in as well as investment for such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

manufacturing and supply chain 

our products are manufactured at both sites operated by us and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos we have a global manufacturing network of 28  sites which utilizes centralized oversight of a system of 13 “anchor” and 15 “satellite” manufacturing sites to maximize cost efficiencies 

in connection with the separation from pfizer the separation 29 manufacturing sites were transferred to us these 29 sites consisted of all of the sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured animal health products see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements 

since the separation we have exited the hannibal missouri site and are in the process of exiting the victoria british columbia canada site both of which are leased facilities 

6   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 



 we own all of these sites with the exception of our facilities in melbourne australia medolla italy van buren arkansas united states san diego california united states and victoria british columbia canada which are leased sites 

in addition to our global manufacturing network and our cmos pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at 13 pfizer sites located in 12 countries pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement included in these 13 pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements   

our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2013 this network was comprised of approximately 200  cmos including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on several factors i their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost ii capacity and iii financial efficiency analyses our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality and are regularly audited 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize distributors as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc formerly known as intervetscheringplough merial the animal health division of sanofi sa elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag novartis animal health the animal health division of novartis ag and boehringer ingelheim animal health the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh in addition we compete with hundreds of other animal health product producers throughout the world 

7   

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states however there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

our livestock products tend to experience lower generic competition than our companion animal products for several reasons 

 the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 4900 granted patents and 2100 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with concentration in our major market countries as well as other countries with strong patent systems such as australia brazil canada europe japan and the united states many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own and pfizers work while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were at least partially developed by and are licensed to us by third parties 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods depending on the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained several patents cover the ceftiofur product line including formulation and use patents that begin expiring in the united states in 2015 with others extending until 2024 draxxin and convenia are covered by patents in the united states with terms that expire in 2021 and 2023 respectively the compound patent on doramectin which is the active ingredient in dectomax an antiparasitic expired in all regions however process patents and the injectable formulation patent for this product do not expire in the united states until 2020 and 2016 respectively the compound patent on selamectin which is the active ingredient in revolution a parasiticide is expiring in the united states canada and europe during 2014 however we have process and formulation patents covering this product expiring in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

in order to facilitate the separation and allow pfizer and our operations to continue with minimal interruption pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a transitional license to use certain of pfizers trademarks and we granted pfizer a transitional license to use certain of our trademarks for a period of time following the completion of the ipo 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 10000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products 

united states 

united states food and drug administration fda  the regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the united states is the center for veterinary medicine cvm housed within the fda all manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the federal

brazil  the ministry of agriculture livestock production and supply mapa is the regulatory body in brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use mapas regulatory activities are conducted through the secretary of agricultural defense and its livestock products inspection department in addition regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the federal agriculture superintendence these activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products as well as the submission review and approval of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives mapa is one of the most active regulatory agencies in latin america having permanent seats at several international animal health forums such as codex alimentarius world organization for animal health and committee of veterinary medicines for the americas mapa was also invited to be a latin american representative at international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich meetings several normative instructions issued by mapa have set regulatory trends in latin america 

australia the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority apvma is an australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the australian marketplace previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration the apvma assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the apvmas scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments if the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people animals the environment or international trade the apvma will register the product as well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products the apvma reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use the apvma also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness the review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used in some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market 

rest of world  countryspecific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling safety efficacy and manufacturers quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products as well as company records and reports with the exception of the eu most other countries regulatory agencies will generally refer to the fda usda eu and other international animal health entities including the world organization for animal health codex alimentarius in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines 

global policy and guidance 

joint faowho expert committee on food additives  the joint faowho expert committee on food additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the world health organization who they provide a risk assessmentsafety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs we work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in foodproducing animals after treatment this in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain

advertising and promotion review promotion of prescription animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries these rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency we conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products 

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we have more than 9800  employees worldwide which includes approximately 4100  employees in the united states and approximately 5700  in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50  union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at third party sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2013 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this 2013 annual report any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline 

this report contains “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements reflect our current views with respect to among other things future events and performance we generally identify forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “project” “plan” “predict” “believe” “seek” “continue” “outlook” “may” “might” “will” “should” “can have” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance actions or events forwardlooking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information these statements are not guarantees of future performance actions or events 

in particular forwardlooking statements include statements relating to our indebtedness our ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness our ability to satisfy the covenants contained in our indebtedness the redemption of the notes expectations regarding indebtedness future use of cash and dividend payments future actions business plans or prospects prospective products product approvals or products under development rd costs timing and likelihood of success future operating or financial performance future results of current and anticipated products and services strategies sales efforts expenses production efficiencies production margins interest rates foreign exchange rates growth in emerging markets the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings our agreements with pfizer government regulation and financial results forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and are potentially inaccurate assumptions however there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if managements underlying beliefs and assumptions prove to be incorrect actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forwardlooking statement you should not put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports and our other filings with the sec we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterials resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013 

in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the united states over a three year period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian our total revenue attributable to medicated feed additives was approximately 446 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the fda indicated that they took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans zoetis supports the fdas efforts to voluntarily phaseout growth promotion indications for medically important antibiotics in food producing animals and will comply with procedures outlined in the december 2013 fda guidance 

we cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition and healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

12   

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore adverse regulations related directly or indirectly to the use of one or more of our products may injure livestock producers market position more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals such as avian influenza footandmouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus otherwise known as pedv which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes for example beginning in 2013 an outbreak of pedv has had serious impacts on swine herds in the united states spreading to at least 27 swineproducing states and affecting up to 30 of the sows in the united states the continued spread of pedv in the united states and neighboring countries could impact the size of swine herds and the demand for our swine products in these markets in addition in april 2012 the usda announced that it had identified a case of bse in california this announcement caused certain countries to implement additional inspections of or suspend the importation of us beef additionally in december 2012 the world animal health organization announced that a case of bse had been identified in brazil this announcement similarly caused certain countries to suspend the importation of brazilian beef while the restrictions that were implemented as a result of these cases of bse have not significantly affected demand for our products the discovery of additional cases of bse may result in additional restrictions related to or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers have seen recent consolidation in their industries if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the widespread drought that impacted the united states in 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years impacting both the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pasture and resulting in a reduction in the total cow herd in 2013 a decrease in harvested corn may result in higher corn prices which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products reduced availability of grazing pasture may also force cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle would result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers for example the economic downturns experienced in many markets across the globe have had an impact on certain of our customers and as a result on our operating results in those affected markets if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet 

13   

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the united states and may be proposed in the united states or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents and data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products our patent protection for these products extends for varying periods in accordance with the dates of filing or grant and the legal life of patents in countries in which patents are granted the protection afforded by our patents which varies from country to country is limited by the following in the applicable country the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before our patent rights expire and their pricing and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions in addition private label products may compete with our products if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we estimate that approximately 80  of our revenue in 2013 was derived from products that are either unpatented ie never patented or offpatent or covered by our patents that while providing a competitive advantage may not provide market exclusivity over the next several years several of our products patents will expire for example our compound patent on selamectin the active ingredient in revolution and stronghold expired in several countries in january 2014 which could lead to the launch of generic counterparts if generic manufacturers are able to successfully designaround our formulation and process patents 

14   

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements 

we are pursuing and will continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets operational revenue growth through new product development and valueadded product lifecycle development improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt and expanding our complementary products and services in addition to base revenue growth we also have historically grown our business through pfizers acquisitions of large pharmaceutical companies that had animal health businesses including the fort dodge animal health fdah business of wyeth and the alpharma animal health business of king pharmaceuticals inc however as a result of the separation we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers acquisition activity we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies including those acquired and those developed internally additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the united states as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites these risks may be increased by the separation because we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers prior relationships and negotiations relating to such agreements we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers our executive officers are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2013 we had goodwill of  982 million  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  803 million  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income and writedowns recorded in our consolidated and combined balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

15   

our historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical combined financial data for the periods prior to the ipo included in this 2013 annual report does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as an independent company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily the result of the following factors 

 our financial condition and future results of operations will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this 2013 annual report for the periods prior to the ipo as a result of the separation it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business 

as an independent public company we are required to expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not previously apply to us and failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial data 

as an independent public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act and regulations of the nyse such requirements will increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs will make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and could be burdensome on our personnel systems and resources we are devoting significant resources to address these public companyassociated requirements including compliance programs and investor relations as well as our financial reporting obligations complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

in particular as a public company our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls in our annual reports on form 10k in addition we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to auditing standard no 5 beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2014 if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities 

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle developments 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research in addition to the rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer we expect to enter into other collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct rd on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

16   

advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities we have a global manufacturing network consisting of 28  manufacturing sites located in 11  countries in addition 13  pfizer sites located in 12  countries manufacture certain of our products for us included in these 13  pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time these 13  pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products we also employ a network of approximately 200  cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

17   

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of united states and foreign competition laws labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the united states attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats is commonly abused by humans as a hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims for example as a result of safety concerns related to our product pregsure bvd in 2010 we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu and in 2011 we suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in new zealand also in may 2013 we were advised that the european commission started a procedure regarding the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv a vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 in swine the initiation of the procedure followed a recall of two batches of suvaxyn pcv as a result of higher than expected adverse reactions reported mainly in spain in june 2013 we completed a root cause investigation of the higher than expected adverse reactions in these two batches and subsequently submitted to the ema a proposed variation to describe specific adjustments to the manufacturing process to help minimize the risk of future reactive batches in october 2013 the ema’s committee on medicinal products for veterinary use adopted a positive opinion as to the proposed variation and concurrently adopted an opinion concluding that no action was required at this time with regard to the eu marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv both opinions were transmitted to the european commission according to the applicable procedure and the commission officially advised us in january 2014 that it had adopted those positive opinions and concluded the procedure begun in may 2013 by maintaining the marketing authorization for suvaxyn pcv in effect 

regulatory actions based on these types of safety quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could depending on the circumstances materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety quality and efficacy of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers any concerns as to the safety qualify or efficacy of our products whether actual or perceived may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals in connection with the separation we will likely change the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and because of these changes may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

in addition we cannot predict the nature of future laws or regulations nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include 

18   

among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the united states of income earned outside the united states 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies absent a clear understanding of these anomalies regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

our failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 the multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability 

19   

in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation of our products between jurisdictions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2013 we generated approximately 54  of our revenue in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro australian dollar and brazilian real we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and venezuela and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivar per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets and we will experience ongoing impacts to earnings as our revenue and expenses will be translated at lower rates we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets including by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america have been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations for all these and other reasons sales within emerging markets carry significant risks 

risks related to intellectual property 

the actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of litigation we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such claims the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

20   

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret data protection and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition patent law reform in the united states and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance in september 2011 the united states enacted the america invents act which will permit enhanced thirdparty actions for challenging patents and will implement a firsttoinvent system in april 2012 australia enacted the intellectual property laws amendment raising the bar act which provides higher standards for obtaining patents in september 2013 the brazilian patent office challenged the validity and term of the socalled “mailbox patents” of pharmaceutical and veterinary companies which were filed in the interim period before brazil fully implemented the traderelated aspects of intellectual property right trips agreements patentability standards the action of the brazilian patent office potentially could shorten the duration or invalidate some of our patents we have filed an appeal but the decision will not be known for several years these reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the united states and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the united states and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone service or power outages failures of the computer systems that operate our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability 

21   

for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on various information systems to manage our operations and we increasingly depend on third parties and applications on virtualized cloud infrastructure to operate and support our information technology systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately service our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the ipo and the separation we have substantially changed a number of our business processes including our financial reporting and supply chain processes in order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with pfizer we have made significant configuration and data changes within some of our information technology systems if our information technology and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and our operations may be adversely affected and as a result our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

in addition over the next few years we expect to implement new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning system to better integrate our manufacturing financial commercial and business operations transitioning to new systems integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions including from circumstances beyond our control affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed unreliable corrupted insufficient or inaccessible any of these potential issues individually or in aggregation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

even if we are able to implement these systems successfully all technology systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information technology systems were to fail or be breached this could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to adequately protect our customers privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws could damage our reputation and result in lost sales fines and lawsuits despite our considerable efforts and technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur our systems and procedures meet the payment card industry pci data security standards which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess compliance failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 36 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding in addition we have entered into an agreement for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 22   

 in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with subsidiaries and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including certain international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the pfizerowned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo as a result of these and other factors we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and exchange offer 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and exchange offer or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all these expected benefits include the following 

 23   

 we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation and exchange offer for a variety of reasons which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

as a result of the separation we have lost pfizers brand reputation capital base and other resources 

prior to the ipo as a business unit of pfizer we generally used the name “pfizer animal health” and we believe the association with pfizer and pfizers globally recognized brand and perceived highquality products contributed to our ability to build relationships with our customers our loss of the use of the “pfizer” name could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers which could result in reduced sales of our products and could impact our ability to attract and retain colleagues which could result in extended vacancies in key or critical positions 

the loss of pfizers scale capital base and financial strength may also prompt suppliers to reprice modify or terminate their relationships with us in addition our separation from pfizer may cause some of our existing agreements and licenses to be terminated 

pfizer may compete with us 

pfizer is not restricted from competing with us in the animal health business including as a result of acquiring a company that operates an animal health business due to the significant resources of pfizer including financial resources name recognition and knowhow resulting from the previous management of our business pfizer could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to engage in the type of business we conduct which may cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

certain of our directors are employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such directors total assets these directors positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us 

pfizer and its directors and officers have limited liability to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty 

our certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any contractual provision to the contrary pfizer will have no obligation to refrain from 

 under our certificate of incorporation neither pfizer nor any officer or director of pfizer except as provided in our certificate of incorporation is liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 and using our common stock to make acquisitions in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence — relationship with pfizer — tax matters agreement 

we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of our rd agreement with pfizer 

prior to the separation as a business unit of pfizer we had the ability to leverage pfizers proprietary compound library and database to identify research and develop compounds suitable as new product candidates for the animal health field as part of the separation we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer which is referred to as the “rd agreement” pursuant to the rd agreement subject to certain restrictions we have continued access to pfizers compound library and database for a period of seven years from the date of the ipo and have subject to pfizers approval the possibility to exclusively license compounds from pfizer that we develop under the rd agreement 

while the rd agreement is intended to supplement our postseparation rd capabilities certain terms of the rd agreement may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit including 

 24   

 each of the foregoing terms and pfizers other rights under the rd agreement and related licenses if any could limit our ability to realize the expected benefits of the rd agreement if we fail to achieve the expected benefits of the rd agreement it may be more difficult time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products 

for a summary description of the terms of the rd collaboration and license agreement see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence— relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement 

pfizers rights as licensor under the patent and knowhow license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer as licensor the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it our ability to continue to research develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited in addition in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted andor in limited instances subject to pfizers right to terminate such license at will these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors 

for a summary description of the terms of the patent and knowhow license pfizer as licensor see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—intellectual property license agreements 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

under the patent and knowhow license agreement pfizer is responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us in the animal health field pfizer has the first right and in some cases the sole right to enforce such licensed patents and in the human health field subject to certain exceptions pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement we may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant charges in connection with the separation and incremental costs as an independent public company 

we will need to replicate or replace certain functions systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access after the separation we may also need to make investments or hire additional employees to operate without the same access to pfizers existing operational and administrative infrastructure these initiatives may be costly to implement due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts the amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate and the timing of the incurrence of these costs is subject to change 

prior to the separation pfizer performed or supported many important corporate functions for our company our combined financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis following the separation many of these services will be governed by our transitional services agreement with pfizer under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party upon prior written notice subject to limited cure periods 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for these services based on pfizers costs of providing the services during the two years following the ipo the markup for these services will be 0 and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7 which we believe is consistent with arms length pricing for the services provided however since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parentsubsidiary relationship the terms of the agreement including the fees charged for the services may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arms length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical financial statements third party costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost in addition while these services are being provided to us by pfizer our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited 

we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate thirdparty agreements on terms and conditions including cost comparable to those that we receive from pfizer under our transitional services agreement additionally after the agreement terminates we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from pfizer when we begin to operate these functions separately if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or are unable to obtain them from other providers we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs and our profitability may decline 

if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on among other things the continuing application of pfizers private 

25   

letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that among other things the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result 

our common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors from our ipo through december 31 2013 the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of 2881 on august 28 2013 to a high sales price of 3542 on march 14 2013 some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2013 annual report are 

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on december 18 2013 our board of directors declared the 2014 first quarter dividend of 0072 per share paid on march 4 2014 to holders of record on january 30 2014 although we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids 

26   

and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

 the components of identifiable intangible assets follow 



developed technology rights 

developed technology rights represent the amortized cost associated with developed technology which has been acquired from third parties and which can include the right to develop use market sell andor offer for sale the product compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products compounds andor processes that have been completed these assets include technologies related to the care and treatment of cattle swine poultry fish sheep dogs cats and horses 

brands 

brands represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with product name recognition as the products themselves do not receive patent protection the more significant finitelived brands are excenel lutalyse and spirovac and the more significant indefinitelived brands are the linco family products and mastitis 

trademarks and tradenames 

trademarks and tradenames represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with legal trademarks and tradenames the more significant components of indefinitelived trademarks and tradenames are indefinitelived trademarks and tradenames acquired from smithklinebeecham the more significant finitelived trademarks and tradenames are finitelived trademarks and tradenames for vaccines acquired from csl animal health 

inprocess research and development 

iprd assets represent rd assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market the majority of these iprd assets were acquired in connection with our acquisition of fdah 

87   

iprd assets are required to be classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated rd effort accordingly during the development period after the date of acquisition these assets will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market typically either the united states or the eu or in a series of other countries subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment at that time we will determine the useful life of the asset reclassify the asset out of iprd and begin amortization if the associated rd effort is abandoned the related iprd assets will be writtenoff and we will record an impairment charge 

for iprd assets there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product 

 the weighted average life of our total finitelived intangible assets developed technology rights and finitelived brands is approximately 12  years total amortization expense for finitelived intangible assets was 63 million  in 2013  67 million  in 2012 and  70 million  in 2011 

the annual amortization expense expected for the years 2014 through 2018 is as follows

14 benefit plans 

the combined statements of income for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the preseparation period included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2013 included all of the benefit plan expenses attributable to the animal health operations of pfizer including expenses associated with pension plans postretirement plans and defined contribution plans the expenses included allocations of direct expenses as well as expenses that were deemed attributable to the animal health operations the combined balance sheet as of december 31 2012 included the benefit plan assets and liabilities of only those plans that were dedicated to animal health employees the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 includes those dedicated plans as well as the benefit plan assets and liabilities that were transferred to zoetis from pfizer as part of the separation as further discussed below all dedicated benefit plans are pension plans 

prior to the separation from pfizer employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans administered and sponsored by pfizer generally most of our employees were eligible to participate in pfizer’s pension plans an employee’s pension benefits were determined based on a combination of years of service and average earnings as defined in the specific plans participants in pfizers us plans generally vested in benefits after three years of service participant vesting in the international plans varies based on the specific plan in each country 

effective december 31 2012  our employees ceased to participate in the pfizer us qualified defined benefit and us retiree medical plans and liabilities associated with our employees under these plans were retained by pfizer pfizer is continuing to credit certain employees service with zoetis generally through december 31 2017 or termination of employment from zoetis if earlier for certain early retirement benefits with respect to pfizers us defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans in connection with the employee matters agreement zoetis is responsible for payment of threefifths of the total cost of the service credit continuation approximately 38 million  for these plans and pfizer is responsible for the remaining twofifths of the total cost approximately 25 million  the 25 million  capital contribution from pfizer and corresponding contraequity account which is being reduced as the service credit continuation is incurred is included in employee benefit plan contribution from pfizer inc in the consolidated statement of equity at december 31 2013  the balance in the contraequity account was approximately 23 million  the amount of the service cost continuation payment to be paid by zoetis to pfizer was determined and fixed based on an actuarial assessment of the value of the growin benefits and will be paid in equal installments over a period of ten  years pension and postretirement benefit expense associated with the extended service for certain employees in the us plans totaled approximately  6 million  in 2013 for additional information see note 19b transactions and agreements with pfizer—agreements with pfizer—employee matters agreement 

pension expense associated with the us and certain significant international locations totaled approximately  15 million  in 2013 inclusive of service cost growin benefits discussed above  61 million  in 2012 and  64 million  in 2011

virtually all of the dedicated pension plan assets are associated with the pension plan in the netherlands the netherlands plan is financed through an insurance contract for which the insurer is responsible for the investment of the plan assets the insurance contract covers certain investment and mortality risks in relation to accrued benefits earned in the plan the assets held in the insurance contract are predominantly fixed income securities the expected return on assets is determined based on the yields available on those assets during 2012 the netherlands manufacturing plant was sold the active participants in the plan were transferred to the buyer at the time of sale and the plan liability associated with inactive participants remained with the insurance contract the insurance contract which is used to finance the plan was also transferred to the buyer although we remain liable for the proportion of administrative costs that relate to inactive members under the terms of this contract through december 31 2013 under the terms of the sale agreement the contract was terminated on december 31 2013 fiscal year 2014 for our international operations and the liability for benefits associated with this plan reverted in full to the insurance company the related settlement charge of approximately 4 million  was recognized in the first quarter of 2014 

net periodic benefit costs and other costs––dedicated plans 

the net periodic benefit cost associated with dedicated pension plans including those transferred to us in 2013 recognized in our consolidated and combined statements of income is approximately  4 million  in 2013  2 million  in 2012 and  3 million  in 2011 the majority of which relate to service cost and interest cost 

the other changes associated with dedicated pension plans recognized in our consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive income are approximately  2 million  loss in 2013  1 million  income in 2012 and  5 million  income in 2011 these other changes are primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions and for 2013 reflects the separation adjustments associated with plans transferred to us from pfizer 

the amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be amortized into 2014 net periodic benefit cost is  02 million  attributable to the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses 

actuarial assumptions––dedicated plans 

the following table provides the weighted average actuarial assumptions for the dedicated pension plans 



the assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at the end of the year and to develop the net periodic benefit cost for the following year therefore the assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations are established at each yearend the net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis the assumptions are revised based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits in 2013 and 2012 the calculation of the weighted average expected rate of compensation increase used to determine benefit obligations excludes the netherlands plan as that plan has no active participants at december 31 2013 and 2012 

actuarial and other assumptions for pension plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

obligations and funded status––dedicated plans 

an analysis of the changes in our benefit obligations plan assets and funded status of our dedicated plans follows 

89   



 actuarial losses were approximately  10 million  at december 31 2013 and  5 million  at december 31 2012 the actuarial gains and losses primarily represent the cumulative difference between the actuarial assumptions and actual return on plan assets changes in discount rates and changes in other assumptions used in measuring the benefit obligations these actuarial gains and losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss  at december 31 2013 and 2012 the actuarial losses included approximately  4 million  and  3 million  respectively associated with the netherlands plan the actuarial loss associated with the netherlands plan was recognized into net periodic benefit costs in full as a result of the termination of the insurance contract associated with the netherlands plan in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining losses will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over an average period of 124  years

plan assets—dedicated plans 

the components of plan assets follow   



 a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions   

specifically the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension assets 

 90   

 the longterm target asset allocations and the percentage of the fair value of plans assets for dedicated benefit plans follow   



zoetis utilizes longterm asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets longterm return expectations are developed with input from outside investment consultants based on the company’s investment strategy which takes into account historical experience as well as the impact of portfolio diversification active portfolio management and the investment consultant’s view of current and future economic and financial market conditions as market conditions and other factors change the targets may be adjusted accordingly and actual asset allocations may vary from the target allocations 

the longterm asset allocation ranges reflect the asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of the respective plans’ longterm benefit obligations these ranges are supported by an analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and our liability profile this analysis referred to as an assetliability analysis also provides an estimate of expected returns on plan assets as well as a forecast of potential future asset and liability balances 

the investment consultants review investment performance with zoetis on a quarterly basis in total as well as by asset class relative to one or more benchmarks 

cash flows—dedicated plans 

our plans are generally funded in amounts that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax and other laws 

contributions to the dedicated plans were approximately  2 million  per year in 2013 2012 and 2011 we expect to contribute approximately 1 million  to our dedicated pension plans in 2014 the benefit payment for 2014 is expected to be approximately  39 million  as the majority of this payment is expected to be made in association with the planned settlement of the liability for the netherlands plan zoetis will fund virtually all of the plan settlement using the existing plan assets the expected benefit payment for each of the next four years is approximately  1 million  per year and approximately  12 million  in the aggregate for the five years thereafter these expected benefit payments reflect the future plan benefits subsequent to 2014 projected to be paid from the plans or from the general assets of zoetis entities in india korea mexico and taiwan under the current actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and therefore actual benefit payments may differ from projected benefit payments 

multiemployer plans    

pension expense associated with certain international benefit plans that are expected to transfer to us from pfizer in 2014 and accounted for as multiemployer plans was approximately 7 million  in 2013 6 million  in 2012 and 5 million  in 2011 contributions to these plans were approximately 6 million  per year in 2013 2012 and 2011 we expect to contribute a total of approximately 7 million  to these plans in 2014 

  b postretirement plans 

prior to the separation from pfizer many of our employees were eligible to participate in postretirement plans sponsored by pfizer as discussed above pfizer is continuing to credit certain united states employees service with zoetis generally through december 31 2017 or termination of employment from zoetis if earlier for certain early retirement benefits with respect to pfizers us retiree medical plans postretirement benefit expense associated with the us and certain significant international locations totaled approximately  4 million  in 2013 inclusive of service cost growin benefits discussed above  17 million  in 2012 and  17 million  in 2011 the expected benefit payments for each of the next five years is approximately  4 million  per year and approximately  14 million  in the aggregate for the five years thereafter 

also prior to the separation from pfizer employees in the united states who met certain eligibility requirements participated in a supplemental nonqualified savings plan sponsored by pfizer in 2013  pfizer transferred the supplemental savings plan liability of approximately 14 million  cash of 9 million  and a deferred tax asset of 5 million  associated with employees transferred to us postseparation employees in the united states who meet certain eligibility requirements participate in a supplemental nonqualified savings plan sponsored by zoetis 

c defined contribution plans 

zoetis has a voluntary defined contribution plan zoetis savings plan that allows participation by substantially all u s employees zoetis matches 100  of employee contributions up to a maximum of 5  of each employee’s eligible compensation the zoetis savings plan also includes a profitsharing feature that provides for an additional contribution ranging between 0  and 8  percent of each employee’s eligible compensation all eligible employees receive the profitsharing contribution regardless of the amount they choose to contribute to the zoetis 

91   

savings plan the profitsharing contribution is a discretionary amount provided by zoetis and is determined on an annual basis employees can direct their contributions and the companys matching and profitsharing contributions initially made into the zoetis stock fund into any of the funds offered these funds provide participants with a cross section of investing options including the zoetis stock fund matching and profitsharing contributions are funded through the issuance of zoetis common stock 

prior to the separation from pfizer our us employees were eligible to participate in pfizer’s defined contribution plans whereby employees contributed a portion of their salaries and bonuses to the plans which was partially matched by pfizer largely in pfizer stock or pfizer stock units the matching contributions in pfizer stock were sourced through open market purchases 

employees are permitted to subsequently diversify all or any portion of their company matching or profitsharing contribution once the contributions have been paid zoetis has no further payment obligations contribution expense associated with the us defined contribution plans totaled approximately  35 million  in 2013  20 million  in 2012 and  18 million  in 2011 

 in january 2013 the zoetis 2013 equity and incentive plan equity plan became effective in order to provide longterm incentives to and facilitate the retention of our employees the principal types of stockbased awards available under the equity plan may include but are not limited to stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus deferred stock unit awards dsus performancebased awards and other equitybased or cashbased awards 

twentyfive million  shares of stock were approved and registered with the sec for grants to participants under the equity plan the shares reserved may be used for any type of award under the equity plan at december 31 2013 the aggregate number of remaining shares available for future grant under the equity plan was 20728313  shares 

 the components of sharebased compensation expense follow 



 stock options represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock within a specified period of time at a specified price the exercise price for a stock option will be not less than 100  of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant stock options granted may include those intended to be “incentive stock options” within the meaning of section 422 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 the code 

stock options are accounted for using a fairvaluebased method at the date of grant in the consolidated statement of income the values determined through this fairvaluebased method generally are amortized on a straightline basis over the vesting term into cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses as appropriate 

eligible employees may receive zoetis stock option grants zoetis stock options granted vest after three  years of continuous service from the grant date and have a contractual term of 10  years 

the fairvaluebased method for valuing each zoetis stock option grant on the grant date uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model which incorporates a number of valuation assumptions noted in the following table shown at their weightedaverage values 



 92   

the following table provides an analysis of stock option activity for the year ended december 31 2013  



 the following table summarizes data related to stock option activity 



 restricted stock is a share of our common stock that is subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse subject to the recipients continued employment the attainment of performance goals or both rsus represent the right to receive shares of our common stock in the future or cash determined by reference to the value of our common stock 

rsus are accounted for using a fairvaluebased method that utilizes the closing price of zoetis common stock on the date of grant in general rsus vest after three  years of continuous service from the grant date and the values are amortized on a straightline basis over the vesting term into cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses as appropriate 

the following table provides an analysis of rsu activity for the year ended december 31 2013  



the follow table provides data related to rsu activity 



93   

 deferred stock unit awards which are granted to nonemployee directors represent the right to receive shares of our common stock at a future date the dsu awards will be automatically settled and paid in shares including fractional shares within sixty days following the nonemployee director’s separation of service on the board of directors 

dsus are accounted for using a fairvaluebased method that utilizes the closing price of zoetis common stock on the date of grant dsus vest immediately as of the grant date and the values are expensed at the time of grant into selling general and administrative expenses  

for the year ended december 31 2013  zoetis granted 34804  dsus at a grant date weightedaverage fair value of  2815  per stock unit there were 35024  dsus outstanding including dividend equivalents as of december 31 2013  

 performancebased awards will require satisfaction of preestablished performance goals consisting of one or more business criteria and a targeted performance level with respect to such criteria as a condition of awards vesting or being settled performance may be measured over a period of any length specified but not less than one year 

our compensation committee is authorized to grant awards in the form of other equitybased awards or other cashbased awards as deemed to be consistent with the purposes of the equity plan the maximum value of the aggregate payment to be paid to any participant with respect to cashbased awards under the equity plan in respect of an annual performance period will be 10 million  

 following the ipo the equity awards previously granted to our employees by pfizer continued to vest and service with zoetis counted as service with pfizer for equity award purposes on june 24 2013  pfizer completed the exchange offer whereby pfizer disposed of all of its shares of zoetis common stock owned by pfizer pfizer accelerated the vesting of and in some cases the settlement of on a prorata basis outstanding pfizer rsus total shareholder return units tsrus and performance share awards psas previously granted to our employees subject in each case to the requirements of section 409a of the us internal revenue code the terms of the 2004 pfizer stock plan and the applicable award agreements and any outstanding deferral elections in addition unvested pfizer stock options previously granted to our employees accelerated in full and our employees generally have the ability to exercise the stock options until the earlier of i june 23 2016  three  years from pfizers completion of the exchange offer ii termination of employee from zoetis or iii the expiration date of the stock option zoetis employees who held pfizer stock options and were retirement eligible as of june 24 2013  will have the full term of the stock option to exercise 

the accelerated vesting of the outstanding pfizer stock options and the settlement on a prorata basis of other pfizer equity awards resulted in the recognition of additional expense for the year ended december 31 2013  of  9 million  which is included in stockbased compensation the unvested portion of pfizer rsus tsrus and psas were forfeited as of the completion of the exchange offer in the third quarter  of 2013  zoetis made a cash payment of approximately  20 million  to certain nonexecutive zoetis employees based on the value of the employees forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas as applicable this amount is included in the consolidated statement of income as additional compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013  members of the zoetis executive team did not receive a cash payment for any forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas but instead in the third quarter of 2013 they were granted zoetis rsus which were equivalent in value and vest on the same date as their forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas 

 the weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was calculated using an aggregate of 500 million  shares of common stock outstanding which was the number of zoetis inc shares outstanding at the time of the ipo there were no zoetis rsus stock options or performance shares outstanding prior to the ipo 

the following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 



94   

 we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for a discussion of our tax contingencies see note 8 tax matters  

 our nontax contingencies include among others the following 

 certain of these contingencies could result in losses including damages fines andor civil penalties andor criminal charges which could be substantial 

we believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur we do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position however we could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

we have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and therefore determining the likelihood of a loss andor the measurement of any loss can be complex consequently we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management but the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions 

amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 

the principal matters to which we are a party are discussed below in determining whether a pending matter is significant for financial reporting and disclosure purposes we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in order to assess materiality such as among other things the amount of damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding if such damages and other relief are specified our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses whether the action purports to be a class action and our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending any experience that we or to our knowledge other companies have had in similar proceedings whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information about the company that is available to the reader the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation and the extent of public interest in the matter in addition with respect to patent matters we consider among other things the financial significance of the product protected by the patent 

roxarsone ® 3nitro   

we are named as defendants in nine  actions involving approximately 140  plaintiffs that allege that the distribution of the medicated feed additive roxarsone allegedly caused various diseases in the plaintiffs including cancers and neurological diseases other defendants including various poultry companies were also named in these lawsuits compensatory and punitive damages were sought in unspecified amounts 

in september 2006  the circuit court of washington county returned a defense verdict in one  of the lawsuits mary green et al v alpharma inc et al in 2008  this verdict was appealed and affirmed by the arkansas supreme court certain summary judgments favoring the poultry company codefendants in mary green et al v alpharma inc et al were reversed by the arkansas supreme court in 2008  these claims were retried in 2009  and that trial also resulted in a defense verdict which was affirmed by the arkansas supreme court in april 2011 in october 2012 we entered into an agreement to resolve these cases subject to the execution of full releases or dismissals with prejudice by all of the claimants we received full releases from all claimants and as a result on january 23 2014 the court dismissed all nine actions with prejudice 

in june 2011 we announced that we would suspend sales in the united states of roxarsone 3nitro in response to a request by the us fda and subsequently stopped sales in several international markets 

following our decision to suspend sales of roxarsone 3nitro in june 2011 zhejiang rongyao chemical co ltd the supplier of certain materials used in the production of roxarsone 3nitro filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of new jersey alleging that we are liable for damages it suffered as a result of the decision to suspend sales in october 2013 the parties reached a preliminary agreement to resolve the matter and the court dismissed the action with prejudice in december 2013 the parties finalized and executed the settlement agreement 

95   

pregsure ®   

we have received in total approximately 200  claims in europe and new zealand seeking damages related to calves claimed to have died of bovine neonatal pancytopenia bnp on farms where pregsure bvd a vaccine against bovine virus diarrhea bvd was used bnp is a rare syndrome that first emerged in cattle in europe in 2006 studies of bnp suggest a potential association between the administration of pregsure and the development of bnp although no causal connection has been established the cause of bnp is not known 

in 2010  we voluntarily stopped sales of pregsure bvd in europe and recalled the product at wholesalers while investigations into possible causes of bnp continue in 2011  after incidences of bnp were reported in new zealand we voluntarily withdrew the marketing authorization for pregsure throughout the world 

we have settled approximately 20  of these claims for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate investigations into possible causes of bnp continue and these settlements may not be representative of any future claims resolutions 

advocin 

on january 30 2012 bayer filed a complaint against pfizer alleging infringement and inducement of infringement of bayer patent us 5756506 covering among other things a process for treating bovine respiratory disease brd by administering a single high dose of fluoroquinolone the complaint was filed after pfizers product advocin ®  was approved as a single dose treatment of brd in addition to its previous approval as a multidose treatment of brd bayer seeks a permanent injunction damages and a recovery of attorneys fees and has demanded a jury trial discovery has now concluded we have filed motions for summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of the bayer patent which are currently pending before the court 

ulianopolis brazil 

in february 2012 the municipality of ulianopolis state of para brazil filed a complaint against fort dodge saúde animal ltda fdsal and five  other large companies alleging that waste sent to a local waste incineration facility for destruction but that was not ultimately destroyed as the facility lost its operating permit caused environmental impacts requiring cleanup 

the municipality is seeking recovery of cleanup costs purportedly related to fdsals share of all waste accumulated at the incineration facility awaiting destruction and compensatory damages to be allocated among the six  defendants we believe we have strong arguments against the claim including defense strategies against any claim of joint and several liability 

at the request of the municipal prosecutor the lawsuit has been suspended since april 2012 since that time the prosecutor has initiated investigations into the municipalitys actions in the matter as well as the efforts undertaken by the six defendants to remove and dispose of their individual waste from the incineration facility 

in early august 2013 new labor claims were filed against fdsal as well as 57  other companies these claims were filed by 30  employees of the local waste incineration facility that was used by fdsal and the 57  other companies the employees of the incineration facility allege health injuries in connection with their employment at the waste site based on legal precedent it is possible that fdsal may be considered a liable party due to the fact that we are in the early stages of the lawsuit the amount of a potential loss if any cannot be reasonably estimated counsel has advised that the likelihood of zoetis being considered severally liable is remote 

other matters 

the european commission published a decision on alleged competition law infringements by several human health pharmaceutical companies on june 19 2013 one of the involved legal entities is zoetis products llc formerly having the name alpharma inc zoetis products llcs involvement is solely related to its human health activities prior to pfizers acquisition of kingalpharma zoetis paid a fine in the amount of euro 11 million  approximately  14 million  and was reimbursed by pfizer in accordance with the global separation agreement between pfizer and zoetis which provides that pfizer is obligated to indemnify zoetis for any liabilities arising out of claims not related to its animal health assets we filed an appeal of the decision on september 6 2013 

 in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses we indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental tax employee andor productrelated matters and patentinfringement claims if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification we would be required to reimburse the loss these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations historically we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and as of december 31 2013  recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant 

c purchase commitments 

as of december 31 2013 we have agreements totaling  66 million  to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and include amounts relating to contract manufacturing and information technology services included in this amount are approximately  1 million  of potential milestone payments that are deemed reasonably likely to occur

 the animal health medicines and vaccines industry is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions as a result of these differences among other things we manage our operations through four  geographic regions each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities within each of these regional operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio including vaccines parasiticides antiinfectives medicated feed additives and other pharmaceuticals for both livestock and companion animal customers 

operating segments

 our chief operating decision maker uses the revenue and earnings of the four operating segments among other factors for performance evaluation and resource allocation 

other costs and business activities 

certain costs are not allocated to our operating segment results such as costs associated with the following 

 segment assets 

we manage our assets on a total company basis not by operating segment therefore our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and accordingly we do not report asset information by operating segment total assets were approximately  66 billion  and  63 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012 respectively

 zoetis had related party transactions with pfizer through the completion of the exchange offer on june 24 2013  as of the completion of the exchange offer pfizer is no longer a related party activities while pfizer was a related party as well as ongoing agreements with pfizer are detailed below 

 for the combined statement of income for the year ended december 31 2012  the costs of goods manufactured in manufacturing plants that were shared with other pfizer business units was approximately 420 million  

in the preseparation period pfizer provided significant corporate manufacturing and shared services functions and resources to us our combined financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  respectively reflect an allocation of these costs for further information about the cost allocations for these services and resources see note 3a basis of presentation basis of presentation prior to the separation management believes that these allocations are a reasonable reflection of the services received however these allocations may not reflect the expenses that would have been incurred if we had operated as an independent public company for the period presented 

pfizer uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations in the preseparation period cash deposits were remitted to pfizer on a regular basis and were reflected in business unit equity and similarly zoetis cash disbursements were funded through pfizers cash accounts and were reflected within business unit equity  

 in connection with the separation and ipo we and pfizer entered into agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer certain of which are described below 

 101   

 following the separation we own have access to or have the right to use substantially all of the resources that were used or held for use exclusively in pfizers animal health business including the following 

 102   

 the amounts charged under each of the agreements with pfizer through the completion of the exchange offer on june 24 2013  were as follows 



in certain jurisdictions while the zoetis entities obtain appropriate registration and licensing pfizer entities purchase product from zoetis entities and resell such product to the local zoetis entity at cost this activity is reflected in accounts receivable for the product pfizer purchases from zoetis entities and in accounts payable  for the product purchased from such pfizer entities by our local zoetis entity 

at december 31 2013  121 million  was included in accounts receivable  as receivable from pfizer and  181 million  was included in accounts payable  as payable to pfizer 

we remained part of pfizers consolidated us tax returns until we fully separated on june 24 2013  and therefore reflected 2013  us income taxes payable of 31 million  as a payable to pfizer in other current liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business these claims and litigation may include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition law labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort we operate in multiple jurisdictions and as a result a claim in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatory penalties in other jurisdictions we intend to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation 

at this time in the opinion of management the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results of operations financial condition or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved in addition regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes such matters are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation even if resolved in our favor 

certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies

market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

tableend on january 31 2013 our registration statement on form s1 file no 333183254 was declared effective for the ipo pursuant to which we registered the offering and sale of 99015000 shares of our class a common stock including 12915000 additional shares pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the ipo was completed on february 6 2013 at a public offering price of 2600 per share for an aggregate gross offering price of approximately 257 billion 

instead of selling shares of our class a common stock directly to the underwriters for cash in the ipo pfizer first exchanged the shares of our class a common stock to be sold in the ipo with certain of the underwriters which we refer to in such role as the “debtforequity exchange parties” for outstanding indebtedness of pfizer held by the debtforequity exchange parties the debtforequity exchange parties then sold shares to the underwriters for cash this debtforequity exchange occurred on the settlement date of the ipo immediately prior to the settlement of the debtforequity exchange parties sale of the shares to the underwriters 

we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the debtforequity exchange parties including any shares sold by the debtforequity exchange parties in connection with the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares 

on june 24 2013 an exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis and the conversion of all outstanding shares of class b common stock to shares of our class a common stock which we now refer to as our common stock there are no shares of class b outstanding 

shares of our common stock are traded on the nyse symbol zts 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales price of our common stock and the cash dividends declared per share of our common stock for each quarter presented below 



as of march 19 2014  there were 500729429  shares of our common stock outstanding held by 2267 shareholders of record information about 5 beneficial owners of our common stock is incorporated by reference from the discussion under the heading ownership of our common stock  in our 2014 proxy statement 

we did not purchase any of our equity securities nor did we sell any securities other than to pfizer upon our formation pursuant to any unregistered offering during the period covered by this report 

dividend policy 

we expect to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock subject to the approval of our board of directors on december 18 2013 our board of directors declared the 2014 first quarter dividend of 0072  per share paid on march 4 2014 to holders of record on january 30 2014 on march 26 2014 our board of directors declared the 2014 second quarter dividend of 0072  per share to be paid on june 2 2014 to holders of record on april 27 2014 

the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the united states impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends therefore no assurance is given that we will pay any dividends to our common stockholders or as to the amount of any such dividends if our board of directors determines to do so 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock will depend on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from certain of our subsidiaries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains a description of our historical performance for periods in which we operated as a business unit of pfizer as well as forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and in the forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  and comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer  sections of this mda 

this mda is organized as follows 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 60 years as a business unit of pfizer inc pfizer and now as an independent public company we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

the animal health medicines and vaccines industry is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions as a result of these differences among other things we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs our four operating segments are the united states us europeafricamiddle east euafme 

31   

canadalatin america clar and asiapacific apac see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  

we directly market our products to livestock producers and veterinarians located in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and south america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole emerging markets contributed 26  of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in the industry’s largest sales organization including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

a summary of our 2013 performance compared to the comparable 2012 and 2011 periods follows 



 our ownership 

on february 6 2013 an initial public offering ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol “zts” prior to and in connection with the ipo we completed a 365 billion senior notes offering senior notes offering and pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of their animal health business we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo we did not receive any of the proceeds from the ipo in addition immediately prior to the completion of the ipo we and pfizer entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer on june 24 2013 an exchange offer was completed whereby pfizer shareholders exchanged a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizers entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis we refer to the transactions to separate our business from pfizer as described here and elsewhere in this 2013 annual report as the “separation” for additional information see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 2 the separation adjustments associated with the separation senior notes offering initial public offering and exchange offer  

our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry sheep and fish livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses health professionals indicate that companion animals improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of pet owners factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 

 32   

product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle developments the majority of our rd programs focus on product lifecycle development which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health medicines and vaccines customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration topical oral intramuscularsubcutaneous injections or intravenous these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take restrictive actions even when there is scientific uncertainty our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 

in december 2013 the fda announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase out in the united states over a three year period of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and under certain circumstances for prevention of disease all under the supervision of a veterinarian we believe the impact of this fda guidance on our financial performance will not be significant based on the overall diversity and breadth of our product portfolio of medicines vaccines and diagnostics serving eight core species 

we cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the current challenging economic environment growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by the economic downturn which decreases the demand for our products and hinders our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care while these factors have mitigated the impacts of the challenging economic environment the impact of difficult macroeconomic conditions increases over time 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions in which we operate principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow ice or other weather conditions particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather furthermore livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water 

33   

due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example drought conditions could negatively impact among other things the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contributes to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn results in less spending on animal health products as such a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition factors influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions the widespread drought which impacted parts of the united states during 2011 2012 and in some regions in 2013 was considered the worst in many years and affected our performance in the united states market in 2012 and in the first half of 2013 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase for example in 2012 we successfully launched a vaccine for horses against the deadly hendra virus in australia 

in 2013 there have been several reported cases of the h7n9 avian influenza virus in china in late march 2013 the chinese government reported the first case of the h7n9 avian influenza virus since that time over 350 cases have been detected we are closely monitoring the developments as this situation unfolds and currently believe the impact on our 2014 global revenue will not be significant while china continues to represent a growth opportunity for us sales in this country represented less than 2 of our total revenue in 2013 and the majority was generated by our swine business 

in addition since the second quarter of 2013 many producers in the united states have been experiencing an outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv pedv has existed in parts of asia for many years it is important to note that the virus which affects piglets does not create a food safety issue we are committed to supporting pork producers in understanding and controlling pedv and we are partnering with the key stakeholders including various academic institutions such as the university of minnesota and iowa state university since first reported in the united states in the second quarter the disease has continued to spread and has now been reported in at least 27 us states canada mexico and parts of south america according to recent reports the outbreak has impacted up to 30 of the sows in the united states we currently believe the impact on our 2014 revenue will not be significant however we are closely monitoring the evolution of this ongoing outbreak and its impact on the swine industry and on our 2014 revenue 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 120 countries and as a result our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in 2013 approximately 53  of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies prior to the ipo as a business unit of pfizer and under pfizers global cash management system our foreign exchange risk was managed through pfizer following the separation we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the brazilian real the australian dollar and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenue cost of goods and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances in 2013 approximately 47  of our total revenue was in us dollars and our yearoveryear revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 2  percentage points from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss of 9 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local assets and liabilities which is included in other incomedeductions—net for the year ended december 31 2013  we will experience ongoing adverse impacts to earnings as our revenue costs and expenses will be translated into us dollars at lower rates these impacts are not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations as of december 31 2013 in venezuela we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of 30 million we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 

 34   

 components of revenue and costs and expenses 

our revenue costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the united states for which the financial information is included in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

revenue 

our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals generally our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists and then sold directly by us or through distributors the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies in 2013 our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 7  of our revenue the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution and draxxin contributed approximately 20  of our revenue our top ten selling product lines contributed approximately 39  of our revenue for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenue in 2013 see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales  consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga  expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd  expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and product lifecycle development overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelife intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs  consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as the king animal health kah business in 2011 and the fort dodge animal health fdah business acquired as part of pfizers acquisition of wyeth in 2009 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net  consist primarily of various items including net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income foreign exchange translation gainslosses and certain asset impairment charges 

comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer 

during the periods prior to the ipo covered by the combined financial statements in this 2013 annual report we operated solely as a business unit of pfizer the related combined financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pfizer and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the animal health business of pfizer these combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations comprehensive income financial position equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent public company during the periods presented in addition the historical combined 

35   

financial statements may not be reflective of what our results of operations comprehensive income financial position equity or cash flows might be in the future as an independent public company 

for a detailed description of the basis of presentation and an understanding of the limitations of the predictive value of the historical combined financial statements see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 3 basis of presentation 

the historical balance sheets may not be comparable to the balance sheet of the standalone company which reflects the transfer by pfizer of substantially all of its animal health business to us noncomparable elements include for example the allocation of pfizer debt which was not transferred cash and cash equivalents which were transferred at a predetermined amount and other assets and liabilities which were not transferred due to legal restrictions and other decisions taken by pfizer 

our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we incur as an independent public company with respect to support functions for example for the periods prior to the ipo our historical combined financial statements include expense allocations for certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within pfizer such as expenses for business technology facilities legal finance human resources and to a lesser extent business development public affairs and procurement among others as part of the separation pursuant to agreements with pfizer pfizer provides us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreedupon fees and we are incurring other costs to replace the services and resources that will not be provided by pfizer as an independent public company our total costs related to such support functions may differ from the costs that were historically allocated to us from pfizer 

we have also incurred certain nonrecurring costs related largely to becoming an independent public company including new branding which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging the creation of a standalone infrastructure the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system the accelerated vesting of pfizer equity awards site separation certain legal registration and patent assignment costs asset impairment charges and certain restructuring and other charges in addition we have incurred certain costs related to the completion of fdah integration activities in 2013 we incurred 262 million of the aforementioned nonrecurring costs and we expect these costs to range between approximately 165 million to 185 million in 2014 these estimates exclude the impact of any depreciation or amortization of capitalized separation expenditures 

some of our products are manufactured at sites that were retained by pfizer or that are operated by pfizer under a saleleaseback arrangement in 2013 pursuant to the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer we purchased these products from pfizer the historical combined statements of income for the periods prior to the ipo include allocations of certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by the manufacturing sites that would not have been charged to us under the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer had such agreement been in effect in the periods presented such as operating variances as well as purchase price and volume variances under a certain threshold the costs allocated in the historical combined statements of income are higher than the amounts that would have been charged by pfizer under the master manufacturing and supply agreement had it been in effect during the periods presented by approximately 10 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and approximately 14 million for the year ended december 31 2011 in connection with the ipo we and pfizer have entered into certain agreements that will provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 19b transactions and agreements with pfizer—agreements with pfizer 

following the ipo the equity awards previously granted to our employees by pfizer continued to vest and service with zoetis counted as service with pfizer for equity award purposes on june 24 2013 pfizer completed the exchange offer whereby pfizer disposed of all of its shares of zoetis common stock owned by pfizer pfizer accelerated the vesting of and in some cases the settlement of on a prorata basis outstanding pfizer rsus total shareholder return units tsrus and performance share awards psas previously granted to our employees subject in each case to the requirements of section 409a of the us internal revenue code the terms of the 2004 pfizer stock plan and the applicable award agreements and any outstanding deferral elections in addition unvested pfizer stock options previously granted to our employees accelerated in full and our employees generally have the ability to exercise the stock options until the earlier of i june 23 2016 three years from pfizers completion of the exchange offer ii termination of employment from zoetis or iii the expiration date of the stock option zoetis employees who held pfizer stock options and were retirement eligible as of june 24 2013 will have the full term of the stock option to exercise 

the accelerated vesting of the outstanding pfizer stock options and the settlement on a prorata basis of other pfizer equity awards resulted in the recognition of additional expense for the year ended december 31 2013 of  9 million  which is included in stockbased compensation the unvested portion of pfizer rsus tsrus and psas were forfeited as of the completion of the exchange offer in the third quarter  of 2013  zoetis made a cash payment of approximately  20 million  to certain nonexecutive zoetis employees based on the value of the employees forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas as applicable this amount is included in the consolidated statement of income as additional compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013  members of the zoetis executive team did not receive a cash payment for any forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas but instead in the third quarter of 2013 were granted zoetis rsus which were equivalent in value and vest on the same date as their forfeited pfizer rsus tsrus and psas 

public company expenses 

as a result of the ipo we became subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act we have established additional procedures and practices as an independent public company as a result we are incurring additional costs including but not limited to internal audit investor relations stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 

recent significant acquisitions and governmentmandated divestitures 

the assets liabilities operating results and cash flows of acquired businesses are included in our results commencing from their respective acquisition dates 

36   

the kah business was acquired by pfizer as part of its acquisition of king pharmaceuticals inc acquired on january 31 2011 strengthening our position in the poultry business with a medicated feed additives business and other poultry products and further strengthening our position in the cattle and swine businesses see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 5a acquisitions divestitures and certain investments—acquisition of king animal health  our combined financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 reflect eleven months of kah’s us operations and ten months of kah’s international operations 

delays in establishing new operating subsidiaries 

due to local regulatory and operational requirements in certain nonus jurisdictions the transfer to us of certain assets and liabilities of pfizers animal health business had not yet legally occurred as of the ipo date these assets and liabilities were not material to our consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate as of december 31 2013 all expected subsidiaries have been established and the related assets and liabilities have transferred 

agreements with pfizer 

on february 6 2013 we entered into a transitional services agreement with pfizer whereby pfizer agreed to provide us with various corporate support services this agreement has a service commencement date of january 1 2013 in the united states and december 1 2012 for our international locations in addition we also entered into a master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer on october 1 2012 whereby we and pfizer agreed to manufacture and supply products to each other commencing january 1 2013 see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 19b transactions and agreements with pfizer agreements with pfizer for more information related to these and other agreements including the related costs 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated and combined financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i fair value ii revenue iii asset impairment reviews and iv contingencies 

below are some of our more critical accounting estimates see also notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies— estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions 

fair value 

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our longterm debt and financial instruments see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 10  financial instruments  

for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews see asset impairment reviews below  

revenue 

our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are heavily dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

37   

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 4 significant accounting policies—deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend heavily on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized 

as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment review we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 

we recorded the following identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs and other incomedeductions—net  as applicable 

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows foreign currency fluctuations and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately  12 million  as of december 31 2013 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price additionally we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date a valuation was performed if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative fair value test is performed 

in 2013 we qualitatively assessed as of september 29 2013 whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying amounts including goodwill based on that assessment we determined that this condition does not exist for all reporting units and performing a quantitative fair value test for our reporting units was not necessary as a result we do not believe that the risk of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units is significant at this time 

when we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we use the income approach the income approach is a forwardlooking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then we apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and information that may affect future results

 we have incurred significant direct costs for restructuring and integrating acquired businesses such as kah on january 31 2011 and fdah on october 15 2009 among others and in connection with our ongoing cost reductionproductivity initiatives 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily related to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the future the majority of these charges or reversals are related to termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes as well as product transfer costs the costs associated with our cost reductionproductivity initiatives are predominantly termination costs associated with plant closings

adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of our products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore has limits in its usefulness to investors because of its nonstandardized definition adjusted net income unlike us gaap net income may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 fdah acquired in 2009 and kah acquired in 2011 include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by 

50   

our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction integration restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with significant business combinations or netasset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items

operating activities 

2013 vs 2012 

net cash provided by  operating activities was  681 million  in 2013 compared with  454 million  in 2012 and was primarily attributable to income before allocation to noncontrolling interests as adjusted for depreciation and amortization the net change in operating assets and liabilities net of acquisitions and divestitures and transfers with pfizer was primarily driven by an increase in other liabilities reflecting higher accrued interest on longterm debt and higher accrued compensation partially offset by higher inventory levels in addition net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the timing and of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business

2012 vs 2011 

net cash provided by  operating activities was  454 million  in 2012 compared with  497 million  in 2011 this decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher inventory balances due to increased demand achieving higher targeted inventory levels for certain products and changes in our supply points partially offset by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 

investing activities

 analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

as global financial markets continue their slow and sometimes uneven recovery from the 20082009 recession additional macroeconomic business and financial volatility may persist as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing

in december 2012 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility which became effective in february 2013 upon the completion of the ipo and which expires in december 2017 subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion  the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for such period of 4351  for fiscal year 2013 3951  for fiscal year 2014 3501  for fiscal year 2015 and 3001  thereafter the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period of 3501  in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2013 there were no  borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2013 

we have additional lines of credit with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2013 we had access to 69 million  of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2016 as of december 31 2013 we had 15 million  of shortterm borrowings outstanding and  2 million  of longterm borrowings outstanding related to these facilities 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as business development activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states no accrual for us taxes is provided 

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend a significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in addition our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the euro brazilian real and australian dollar prior to the ipo as a business unit of pfizer and under pfizers global cash management system our foreign exchange risk was managed through pfizer following the separation we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenue in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities 

foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany shortterm foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations 

our financial instruments at december 31 2013  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined using level 2 inputs for additional details see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 4 significant accounting policies —  fair value  the sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forwardexchange contracts at december 31 2013  indicates that if the us dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of 

60   

these contracts would increase by  46 million  and if the us dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10 the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  42 million  for additional details see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 10b financial instruments —  derivative financial instruments  

interest rate risk 

our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt interest on our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2013  we had no outstanding principal balance under our credit facility see notes to consolidated and combined financial statements— note 10 financial instruments

on february 6 2013 an initial public offering ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares as of the date of this 2012 annual report pfizer owns 100 of our outstanding class b common stock and no shares of our class a common stock giving pfizer 802 of the economic interest and the combined voting power in shares of our outstanding common stock other than with respect to the election of directors and 976 of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to the election of directors on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol “zts” prior to and in connection with the ipo we completed a 365 billion senior notes offering senior notes offering and pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of their animal health business we did not receive any of the proceeds from the ipo we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo in addition immediately prior to the completion of the ipo we and pfizer entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer we refer to the transactions to separate our business from pfizer as described here and elsewhere in this 2012 annual report as the “separation” for additional information see notes to combined financial statements— note 19 subsequent events  as well as recent developments  below 

operating segments   

the animal health medicines and vaccines market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions this is due to a variety of factors including 

 as a result of these differences among other things we organize and operate our business in four segments the united states europeafricamiddle east canadalatin america and asiapacific within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs our operating segments are 

 for additional information regarding our performance in each of these operating segments and the impact of foreign exchange rates as well as significant acquisitions that pfizer completed in recent years see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

products 

since the inception of our business we have focused on developing a broad portfolio of animal health products we refer to a single product brand in all of its dosage forms for all species as a product line we have comprehensive product lines for both livestock and companion animals across each of our major product categories 

our major product categories are 

 our remaining revenues are derived from other product categories such as nutritionals and agribusiness as well as products in complementary areas including diagnostics genetics devices and services such as dairy data management elearning and professional consulting we believe many of these complementary areas represent potential growth opportunities for our business to expand in the future 

historically a substantial portion of our products and revenues have been the result of brand lifecycle development for example the first product in our ceftiofur line was an antiinfective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection through followon studies and reformulations we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes as well as other species and regions several products in the line provide a full course of therapy in one injection the ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands excede excenel and naxcel 

in addition to brand lifecycle development we also pursue the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product research and development rd as part of our growth strategies examples of our firstinclass or bestinclass products that we have launched in the past ten years and products that we believe may represent platforms for future brand lifecycle development include 

 we pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market” examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first equine vaccine for west nile virus in the us and european union and the first swine vaccine for pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in the us 

our livestock products primarily prevent or treat diseases and conditions to enable the costeffective production of safe highquality animal protein human population growth and increasing standards of living are important growth drivers for our livestock products in three major ways first as population grows and standards of living rise there is increased demand for improved nutrition particularly animal protein second population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity and finally as standards of living improve there is increased focus on food safety livestock products represented approximately 65  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 

our companion animal products improve the quality of and extend the life of pets increase convenience and compliance for pet owners and help veterinarians improve the quality of care they provide growth in the companion animal medicines and vaccines sector is driven by economic development and related increases in disposable income increasing pet ownership companion animals living longer increasing medical treatment of companion animals and advances in animal health medicines and vaccines companion animal products represented approximately 35  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 

in 2012 our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 7  of our revenues the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution and draxxin contributed approximately 20  of our revenues our top ten product lines contributed 39  of our revenues our product lines and products that represented approximately 1 or more of our revenues in 2012 include

companion animal products 



international operations 

we directly market our products in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and latin america and our products are sold in more than 120 countries revenues from operations outside of the us accounted for 59  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india emerging markets contributed 26  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors— risks related to our international operations  

sales and marketing 

our sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists as well as contracts with distributors in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

our sales representatives visit our customers including veterinarians and livestock producers to inform promote and sell our products and services our technical and veterinary operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management training and education on diverse topics including responsible product use and generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees these direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers additionally our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols including through the use of our products as a result of these relationships our sales and consulting visits are typically longer more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to human health as of december 31 2012 our sales organization consisted of approximately 3300 employees 

our livestock and companion animal products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian on a more limited basis in certain markets we sell certain products through local agricultural and farming retail outlets pharmacies and pet stores we also market our products by advertising to veterinarians livestock producers and pet owners 

customers 

we sell our livestock products directly to a diverse set of livestock producers including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork poultry and aquaculture operations and to veterinarians thirdparty veterinary distributors and retail outlets that typically then sell the products to livestock producers we primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to thirdparty veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners our two largest customers both distributors represented approximately 9 and 6 respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 and no other customer represented more than 4 of our revenues for the same period

research and development 

our research and development operations are comprised of our dedicated veterinary medicine research and development organization research alliances and other operations focused on the development of our products we spent 409 million in 2012 427 million in 2011 and 411 million in 2010 on research and development 

while the development of new chemical and biological entities through new product rd continues to play an important role in our growth strategies the majority of our rd investment is focused on brand lifecycle development new product rd leverages discoveries of agribusiness academia and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology rd organizations our brand lifecycle development leverages our existing product portfolio to expand our product lines by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new countries and creating new combinations and reformulations our ability to leverage both the discoveries of other industries and of our existing rd generally leads to a costeffective efficient sustainable and more predictable rd process in addition our other rd activities include the development of branded generic products genetics and diagnostics as well as biodevices and engineering investments for in ovo  applications 

we prioritize our rd spending on an annual basis with the goal of transparency and alignment of research and business objectives and do not disaggregate our rd operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business instead we allocate capital based on return on investment criteria taking into account customer needs revenues and profitability potential the probability of technical and regulatory success and timing of launch a centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend without a focus on spending by research stage or by therapeutic area this comprehensive view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency 

prior to the ipo we entered into a rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer pursuant to which we will maintain access to pfizers proprietary compound library and database to develop new products subject to certain restrictions see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement    in addition we intend to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 1000 employees in our global rd operations our rd headquarters is located in kalamazoo michigan we have rd operations colocated with manufacturing sites in melbourne australia louvainlaneuve belgium guarulhos brazil jilin china olot spain and san diego ca charles city ia and lincoln ne in the us we colocate rd operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing in addition we maintained rd operations in zaventem belgium são paulo brazil victoria british columbia canada mumbai and new delhi india and college park md and durham nc in the us as part of the separation pfizer conveyed to us its interest in each of these rd facilities with the exception of our mumbai india facility which we expect pfizer to transfer to us for agreed upon cash consideration and in the interim we will lease the facility from pfizer see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—mumbai india interim lease agreement  each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents 

many of our research programs involve an external partnership often with funding from a nongovernmental organization or a government grant we are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental direct and indirect expertise in as well as investment for such external partnerships depending on the nature of the agreement we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models 

manufacturing and supply chain 

prior to the separation our products were manufactured at both sites operated by pfizer and sites operated by thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations which we refer to as cmos 

in connection with the separation pfizer transferred 29 manufacturing sites to us these 29 sites consist of all of the sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured animal health products we refer to these 29 sites as our global manufacturing network see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements 

our global manufacturing network utilizes centralized oversight of a system of 13 “anchor” and 16 “satellite” manufacturing sites to maximize cost efficiencies 

5   

our global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites 



 ownership of these facilities was conveyed to us by pfizer as part of the separation with the exception of our facilities in hannibal missouri medolla italy and san diego california which are leased sites the leasehold interests in these sites were conveyed to us by pfizer as part of the separation 

in addition to our global manufacturing network pfizer continues to manufacture products for us at 14 pfizer sites located in 13 countries pursuant to a master manufacturing and supply agreement included in these 14 pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time these 14 pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products the decision to continue manufacturing our products at pfizer sites will be reevaluated in the future based on several factors including manufacturing costs and the needs of our business see  item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements   

the pfizer sites that continue to manufacture products for us are listed in the table below all of these sites are owned by pfizer with the exception of the guarulhos brazil facility which is owned by us and leased back to pfizer 



6   

 our global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of cmos as of december 31 2012 this network was comprised of approximately   200  cmos  including those centrally managed as well as local cmos 

we select cmos based on capacity and financial efficiency analyses and our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the cmos we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality and are regularly audited 

we purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of thirdparty suppliers we utilize distributors as a part of our global supply chain primarily for shipping and logistics support 

we intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization including six sigma and lean capabilities which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency we have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and cmo sites 

competition 

although our business is the largest based on revenues in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions and sectors in which we compete principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category and individual product and include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as merck animal health the animal health division of merck  co inc formerly known as intervetscheringplough merial the animal health division of sanofi sa elanco the animal health division of eli lilly and company bayer animal health the animal health division of bayer ag novartis animal health the animal health division of novartis ag and boehringer ingelheim animal health the animal health division of boehringer ingelheim gmbh in addition we compete with hundreds of other animal health product producers throughout the world 

the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the us however there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry the reasons for this include the smaller average market size of each product opportunity the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily selfpay nature of the business in addition companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians 

our livestock products tend to experience lower generic competition than our companion animal products for several reasons 

 the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty as a result we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights our policy is to vigorously protect enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property as appropriate 

our product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 4000 granted patents and 2000 pending patent applications filed in more than 60 countries with concentration in our major market countries as well as other countries with strong patent systems such as australia brazil canada europe japan and the us many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own and pfizers work while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were at least partially developed by and are licensed to us by third parties 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods depending on the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained several patents cover the ceftiofur product line including formulation and use patents that begin expiring in the us in 2015 with others extending until 2024 draxxin and convenia are covered by patents in the us with terms that expire in 2021 and 2023 respectively the compound patent on doramectin which is the active ingredient in dectomax an antiparasitic has expired in 

7   

all regions however process patents and the injectable formulation patent for this product do not expire in the us until 2020 and 2016 respectively the compound patent on selamectin which is active in revolution a parasiticide expires in the us canada and europe in 2014 

additionally many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow including by seeking to require our employees consultants advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement 

in order to facilitate the separation and allow pfizer and our operations to continue with minimal interruption pfizer has licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field we license to pfizer the right to use certain of our trademarks and substantially all of our other intellectual property rights in the human health field and all other fields outside of animal health in addition pfizer granted us a transitional license to use certain of pfizers trademarks and we granted pfizer a transitional license to use certain of our trademarks for a period of time following the completion of the ipo 

prior to the separation as a business unit of pfizer we had the ability to leverage pfizers proprietary compound library and database to identify research and develop compounds suitable as new product candidates for the animal health field as part of the separation we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer pursuant to which subject to certain restrictions we have continued access to pfizers compound library and database for a period of seven years and subject to pfizers approval we have the possibility to exclusively license compounds from pfizer that we develop under the rd collaboration and license agreement using portions of pfizers proprietary compound library and database we believe that this agreement may help bolster our rd capability to support the continued longterm viability of our product pipeline for animal health 

we seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have or desire to have a business presence for a particular product or service we currently maintain more than 9500 trademark applications and registrations in major regions identifying goods and services dedicated to the care of livestock and companion animals 

regulatory 

the sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products to maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements we have established processes systems and dedicated resources with endtoend involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products in the majority of our markets the relevant health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products 

united states

brazil  the ministry of agriculture livestock production and supply mapa is the regulatory body in brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use mapas regulatory activities are conducted through the secretary of agricultural defense and its livestock products inspection department in addition regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the federal agriculture superintendence these activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products as well as the submission review and approval of pharmaceuticals biologicals and medicated feed additives mapa is one of the most active regulatory agencies in latin america having permanent seats at several international animal health forums such as codex alimentarius world organization for animal health and committee of veterinary medicines for the americas mapa was also recently invited to be a latin american representative at international cooperation on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of veterinary medicinal products vich meetings several normative instructions issued by mapa have set regulatory trends in latin america 

australia the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority apvma is an australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the australian marketplace previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration the apvma assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the apvmas scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments if the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people animals the environment or international trade the apvma will register the product as well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products the apvma reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use the apvma also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness the review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used in some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market 

rest of world  countryspecific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling safety efficacy and manufacturers quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products as well as company records and reports with the exception of the eu most other countries regulatory agencies will generally refer to the fda usda eu and other international animal health entities including the world organization for animal health codex alimentarius in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines 

global policy and guidance 

joint faowho expert committee on food additives  the joint faowho expert committee on food additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the world health organization who they provide a risk assessmentsafety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs we work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in foodproducing animals after treatment this in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain 

advertising and promotion review promotion of ethical animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries these rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency we conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products 

food safety inspection servicegenerally recognized as safe  the fda is authorized to determine the safety of substances including “generally recognized as safe” substances food additives and color additives as well as prescribing safe conditions of use however although the fda has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances the food safety and inspection service the public health agency in the usda still retains under the tenets of the federal meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act and their implementing regulations the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products 

employees 

as of march 15 2013 we have more than 9300 employees worldwide which includes approximately 3900 employees in the us and approximately 5400 in other jurisdictions some of these employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements including approximately 50 union employees in the united states 

environmental health and safety 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment including at third party sites or offsite disposal locations or that currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites where such a release occurred in addition to cleanup actions brought by federal state local and foreign governmental 

9   

entities private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous materials on from or otherwise relating to such a property 

we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations we are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past andor future remediation or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution in connection with such proceedings and otherwise we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites or financing other parties completion of such activities as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2012 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activities as follows 

 however we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties or those liabilities associated with offsite disposal locations such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

in connection with past acquisitions and divestitures we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us or may require us in the future to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate we have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups however such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all 

while we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites we have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition

with the sec we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

risks related to our business and industry 

restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals may become more prevalent 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterials resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a subcategorization of the products that make up our antiinfectives and medicated feed additives portfolios in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration in feed or injectable these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty for example in april 2012 the fda announced guidance calling for the voluntary elimination over a period of time of the use of medically important antibacterials in animal feed for growth promotion in food production animals medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health the guidance provides for continued use of antibacterials in food producing animals for treatment control and prevention of disease under the supervision of a veterinarian the fda indicated that they took this action to help preserve the efficacy of medically important antibacterials to treat infections in humans our revenues attributable to antibacterials for livestock were approximately 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012 we cannot predict whether antibacterials resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products 

our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products there may be a decline in the production of such food products and in turn demand for our products for example livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights nutrition and healthrelated or other concerns any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries including our company adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products 

companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and as a result they may reduce their use of our products which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore adverse regulations related directly or indirectly to the use of one or more of our products may injure livestock producers market position more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also many foodproducing companies including livestock producers benefit from governmental subsidies and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated these companies may become less profitable and as a result may reduce their use of our products 

an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products 

sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals such as avian influenza footandmouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein in addition outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes for example in april 2012 the usda announced that it had identified a case of bse in california this announcement caused certain countries to implement additional inspections of or suspend the importation of us beef additionally in december 2012 the world animal health organization announced that a case of bse had been identified in brazil this announcement similarly caused certain countries to suspend the importation of brazilian beef while the restrictions that were implemented as a result of these cases of bse have not significantly affected demand for our products the discovery of additional cases of bse may result in additional restrictions related to or reduced demand for animal protein which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere 

consolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products 

veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers in recent years there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals in addition livestock producers particularly swine and poultry producers have seen recent consolidation in their industries if these trends towards consolidation continue these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

14   

our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the drought currently impacting the us is considered the worst in many years impacting both the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pasture the decrease in harvested corn has resulted in higher corn prices which has impacted the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock size that may result in reduced spending on animal health products reduced availability of grazing pasture may also force cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle would result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions 

the global financial markets have undergone and may continue to experience significant volatility and disruption the timing and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional macroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by the economic downturn and continue to face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems that have given rise to and could continue to give rise to payment delays increased credit risk bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers if one or more of our large customers including distributors discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in addition economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet 

our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income 

feed fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products including by switching to lowercost alternatives to our products in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lowercost alternatives to our products these shifts could result in a decrease of sales of our companion animal products especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership 

changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share margins and distribution of our products 

in most markets companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians companion animal owners increasingly could purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians such as internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on and visits to veterinarians as they rely more on internetbased animal health information because we market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives 

legislation has also been proposed in the us and may be proposed in the us or abroad in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products for example such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lowercost alternatives many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has longstanding policies in place to encourage this practice 

over time these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on internetbased retailers “bigbox” retail stores or other overthecounter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products we may be unable to sustain our current margins and we may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our products if an increased portion of our sales is through these channels any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

the animal health industry is highly competitive 

the animal health industry is highly competitive we believe many of our competitors are conducting rd activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses these competitors may have access to greater financial marketing technical and other resources as a result they may be able to devote more resources to developing manufacturing marketing and selling their products initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities in addition to competition from established market participants new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete 

to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce or are unable to raise the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected competitive pressure could arise from among other things safety and efficacy concerns limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market price reductions by competitors the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us 

generic products may be viewed as more costeffective than our products 

we face competition from products produced by other companies including generic alternatives to our products we depend on patents to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products our patent protection for these products extends for varying periods in accordance with the dates of filing or grant and the legal life of patents in countries in which patents are granted the protection afforded by our patents which varies from country to country is limited by the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country as a result we may face competition from lowerpriced generic alternatives to many of our products generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions in addition private label products may compete with our products if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we estimate that approximately 80  of our revenues in 2012 were derived from products that are either unpatented ie never patented or offpatent or covered by our patents that while providing a competitive advantage do not provide market exclusivity over the next several years several of our products patents will expire 

we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses license rights to technologies or products form and manage alliances or divest businesses 

we may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all in addition we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets we may be subject to litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions dispositions licenses or other alliances including claims from terminated employees customers or third parties and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business disposition license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient these effects could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve expected gross margin improvements 

we are and may continue to pursue strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our longterm success including but not limited to increasing sales in emerging markets base revenue growth through new product development and valueadded brand lifecycle development improving operational efficiency through manufacturing efficiency improvement and other programs using cash flow from operations to service or reduce debt and expanding our complementary products and services in addition to base revenue growth we also have historically grown our business through pfizers acquisitions of large pharmaceutical companies that had animal health businesses including the fort dodge animal health business of wyeth and the alpharma animal health business of king pharmaceuticals inc however as a result of the separation we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers acquisition activity we also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses and we intend to continue to do so in the future there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives including significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are outside of our control accordingly we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives it could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives if any benefits are achieved at all we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements on our products and technologies including those acquired and those developed internally additionally our business strategy may change from time to time which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business 

our business could be affected adversely by labor disputes strikes or work stoppages 

some of our employees are members of unions works councils trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions including the us as a result we are subject to the risk of labor disputes strikes work stoppages and other laborrelations matters we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites these risks may be increased by the separation because we are no longer able to benefit from pfizers prior relationships and negotiations relating to such agreements we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition potentially resulting in 

16   

canceled orders by customers unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenues and net income in addition labor problems at our suppliers or cmos could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

loss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers our executive officers are not currently and are not expected to be subject to noncompete provisions in addition we have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage the loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets and record a noncash impairment charge as of december 31 2012 we had goodwill of  985 million  and identifiable intangible assets less accumulated amortization of  868 million  identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights brands trademarks license agreements patents and inprocess rd 

determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment future events or new information may change managements valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our combined statements of income and writedowns recorded in our combined balance sheets could vary if managements conclusions change any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our historical combined financial data is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical combined financial data included in this 2012 annual report does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily the result of the following factors 

 our financial condition and future results of operations after giving effect to the separation will be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this 2012 annual report as a result of the separation it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business 

as a standalone public company we will expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not previously apply to us and failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial data 

as a standalone public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act and regulations of the new york stock exchange nyse such requirements will increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs will make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and could be burdensome on our personnel systems and resources we will devote significant resources to address these public companyassociated requirements including compliance programs and investor relations as well as our financial reporting obligations complying with these rules and regulations has and will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

in particular as a public company our management will be required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls in our annual reports on form 10k under current rules we will be subject to these requirements beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2013 in addition we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to auditing standard no 5 beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2014 if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities 

17   

risks related to research and development 

our rd acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and brand lifecycle developments 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to rd both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties 

we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched or we may be unable to develop license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products in addition we cannot predict whether any products once launched will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenues that are consistent with our expectations the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and as a result products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets furthermore the timing and cost of our rd may increase and our rd may become less predictable for example changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more timeconsuming andor costly to research develop and register products 

products in the animal health industry are sometimes derived from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human health research in addition to the rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer we expect to enter into other collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to compounds and other technology for purposes of our business such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement if we enter into these arrangements we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators which we may not be able to control if we are unable to access human healthgenerated molecules and compounds to conduct research and development on costeffective terms our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited 

advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affect the market for our products 

the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction andor broad market acceptance of newlydeveloped or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred diseaseresistant animals in addition technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our rd relies on evaluations in animals which may become subject to bans or additional regulations 

as an animal health medicines and vaccines business the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful our rd and by extension our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation 

risks related to manufacturing 

manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays inventory shortages recalls or unanticipated costs 

in order to sell our products we must be able to produce and ship sufficient quantities we have a global manufacturing network consisting of 29  manufacturing sites located in 11  countries in addition 14  pfizer sites located in 13  countries manufacture certain of our products for us included in these 14  pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time these 14  pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products we also employ a network of approximately 200  cmos many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are solesourced from certain manufacturing sites 

minor deviations in our manufacturing processes such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing could result in delays inventory shortages unanticipated costs product recalls product liability andor regulatory action in addition a number of factors could cause production interruptions including 

 18   

 these interruptions could result in launch delays inventory shortages recalls unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties which may adversely affect our operating results for example our manufacturing site in medolla italy was damaged in an earthquake in may 2012 which resulted in production interruptions at that site 

our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes the unpredictability of a products regulatory or commercial success or failure the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition increase the potential for capacity imbalances in addition construction of sites is expensive and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites which is uncertain 

we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs 

the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand weather conditions supply conditions government regulations economic climate and other factors in addition labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor governmental regulations economic climate and other factors increases in the demand for availability or the price of materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain thirdparty suppliers are the sole source of certain materials necessary for production of our products we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our thirdparty suppliers cease or interrupt operations or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us 

risks related to legal matters and regulation 

we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters 

our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters these matters include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition law labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort in addition changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our exposure to liability for example in the us attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of or injury to a companion animal if such attempts were successful our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially 

litigation matters regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the misuse or offlabel use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages 

our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species there may be increased risk of product liability if veterinarians livestock producers pet owners or others attempt to use our products offlabel including the use of our products in species including humans for which they have not been approved for example ketamine the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product is a commonly abused hallucinogen furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for offlabel use such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

animal health products are subject to unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns which may harm our reputation 

unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to animal health products whether or not scientifically or clinically supported leading to product recalls withdrawals or suspended or declining sales as well as product liability and other claims for example as a result of safety concerns related to our product pregsure bvd in 2010 we voluntarily suspended sales of the product and withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu and in 2011 we also suspended sales and withdrew the marketing authorization for the product in new zealand 

in addition we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers and such concerns may harm our reputation these concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition regardless of whether such reports are accurate 

our business is subject to substantial regulation 

we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products even after a product reaches market it may be subject to rereview and may lose its approvals in connection with the separation we will likely change the location of the manufacture of certain of our products and because of these changes may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals our failure to obtain approvals delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained if ever 

19   

in addition we cannot predict the nature of future laws or regulations nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations or of disparate federal state local and foreign regulatory schemes changes to such laws or regulations may include among other things changes to taxation requirements such as taxrate changes and changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us 

changes in applicable federal state local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example regulatory agencies have recently increased their focus on the potential for vaccines to induce immunity anomalies absent a clear understanding of these anomalies regulatory scrutiny of vaccines may become stricter additional scrutiny or regulation of our vaccine products could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the generation use storage handling treatment packaging transportation exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials including recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements and the health and safety of our employees due to our operations these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities these authorities can modify or revoke our permits registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions 

given the nature of our business we have incurred are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities under the united states comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or cercla or under other federal state local and foreign environmental cleanup laws with respect to our current or former sites adjacent or nearby thirdparty sites or offsite disposal locations see item 1 business—environmental health and safety  the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment such liability could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products 

our failure to comply with the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject including any permits issued thereunder may result in environmental remediation costs loss of permits fines penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our international operations 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic political legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business 

our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following 

 20   

the multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our crossborder arrangements and subject us to additional tax adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability 

in addition international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology a failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings monetary or nonmonetary penalties or both disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation in addition variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation of our products between jurisdictions while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in any of these laws regulations or requirements or the political environment in a particular country may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets including investment procurement and repatriation of earnings 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies in 2012 we generated approximately 54 of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro australian dollar and brazilian real we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations 

we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or unable to do so without incurring substantial costs we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and venezuela and if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivar per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets and we will experience ongoing impacts to earnings as our revenues and expenses will be translated at lower rates 

we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets 

we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets including by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local regional or global economic political or social instability or crisis for example our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters furthermore we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries in addition certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially which may impact our financial performance for example in the past our revenues in certain emerging markets in latin america have been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations for all these and other reasons sales within emerging markets carry significant risks 

risks related to intellectual property 

the actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business 

a third party may sue us or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of the thirdpartys patents trademarks trade dress copyrights trade secrets domain names or other intellectual property rights if we do not prevail in this type of litigation we may be required to 

 the costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition even if we successfully defend such claims the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop manufacture or commercialize the patented product we cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing developing or marketing certain of our products regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

21   

if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws for example some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself and its first use and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term the validity enforceability scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each countrys practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights in addition if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

in addition patent law reform in the us and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive for instance in september 2011 the us enacted the america invents act which will permit enhanced thirdparty actions for challenging patents and implement a firsttoinvent system and in april 2012 australia enacted the intellectual property laws amendment raising the bar act which provides higher standards for obtaining patents these reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or relabel a product as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected 

many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us may occur even when we take steps to prevent it we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition in the future we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties and that the costs of doing so may outweigh the value of doing so and this could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

risks related to information technology 

we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites 

in many markets around the world such as the us and brazil we provide online ordering sites to customers often relying on third parties to host and support the application the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online ordertaking and fulfillment operations risks associated with our online business include disruptions in telephone service or power outages failures of the computer systems that operate our website including inadequate system capacity computer viruses human error changes in programming security breaches system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers rapid technology changes credit card fraud natural disasters or adverse weather conditions power and network outages changes in applicable federal and state regulations liability for online content and consumer privacy concerns problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation 

22   

we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure 

we rely on various information systems to manage our operations and we increasingly depend on third parties and applications on virtualized or “cloud” infrastructure to operate and support our information technology systems these third parties include large established vendors as well as many small privately owned companies failure by these providers to adequately service our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the ipo and the separation we have substantially changed a number of our business processes including changes in our financial reporting and supply chain processes in order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with pfizer we have made significant configuration and data changes within some of our information technology systems if our information technology and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and our operations may be adversely affected and as a result our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

in addition over the next few years we expect to implement new business systems to support our operations including an enterprise resource planning system to better integrate our manufacturing financial commercial and business operations transitioning to new systems integrating new systems into current systems or any disruptions or malfunctions including from circumstances beyond our control affecting our information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed unreliable corrupted insufficient or inaccessible any of these potential issues individually or in aggregation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

even if we are able to implement these systems successfully all technology systems despite implementation of security measures are vulnerable to disability failures or unauthorized access if our information technology systems were to fail or be breached this could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised 

we may be unable to adequately protect our customers privacy or we may fail to comply with privacy laws 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical and the regulatory environment surrounding information security storage use processing disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements in addition our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information any actual or perceived significant breakdown intrusion interruption cyberattack or corruption of customer employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal state local and foreign privacy laws could damage our reputation and result in lost sales fines and lawsuits despite our considerable efforts and technology to secure our computer network security could be compromised confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur our systems and procedures meet the payment card industry or pci data security standards which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess compliance failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards in addition pci is controlled by a limited number of vendors that have the ability to impose changes in pcis fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with pci security standards as well as significant unanticipated expenses such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity we incurred approximately 365 billion aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness with an original issue discount of 10 million including the 10 billion of our senior indebtedness that was transferred to pfizer and subsequently sold by pfizer after the completion of the senior notes offering our total debt was 364 billion net of original issue debt discount of 10 million immediately prior to the completion of the ipo we transferred an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer in addition we have entered into an agreement for a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program each with a capacity of up to 10 billion while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future 

we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including 

 23   

in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest for example our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that among other things limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability subject to certain exceptions to incur liens merge consolidate or sell transfer or lease assets transact with subsidiaries and incur priority indebtedness our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations alter our dividend policy seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due 

in addition we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries including our international subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all may materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes 

upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade below investment grade by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of the pfizerowned notes and we paid an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the net proceeds that we received in the senior notes offering to pfizer prior to the completion of the ipo as a result of these and other factors we may not have sufficient funds available to finance a change of control offer 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes 

the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if in such rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs 

risks related to our relationship with pfizer 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and distribution 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all these expected benefits include the following 

 24   

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation and distribution for a variety of reasons which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

pfizer controls the direction of our business and the concentrated ownership of our common stock prevents our stockholders from influencing significant decisions 

pfizer owns 100 of our outstanding class b common stock and no shares of our class a common stock giving pfizer 802  of the economic interest and the combined voting power in shares of our outstanding common stock other than with respect to the election of directors and 976  of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to the election of directors as long as pfizer beneficially controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to a particular matter it will generally be able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval including the election and removal of directors even if pfizer were to control less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock it may be able to influence the outcome of such corporate actions so long as it owns a significant portion of our common stock if pfizer does not complete the distribution or otherwise dispose of its shares of our common stock it could remain our controlling stockholder for an extended period of time or indefinitely 

pfizers interests may not be the same as or may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders our stockholders other than pfizer will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote while pfizer controls the majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result pfizer is able to control directly or indirectly and subject to applicable law all matters affecting us including 

 because pfizers interests may differ from ours or from those of our other stockholders actions that pfizer takes with respect to us as our controlling stockholder may not be favorable to us or our other stockholders 

the distribution may not occur 

pfizer has no obligation to complete the distribution whether pfizer proceeds with the distribution in whole or in part is subject to a number of conditions including the receipt of any necessary regulatory or other approvals the existence of satisfactory market conditions and the continuing application of pfizers private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of opinions of counsel to the effect that such distribution would be taxfree to pfizer and its stockholders even if pfizer elects to pursue the distribution pfizer has the right to abandon or change the structure of the distribution if pfizer determines in its sole discretion that the distribution is not in the best interest of pfizer or its stockholders 

furthermore if the distribution does not occur or if pfizer does not otherwise dispose of its shares of our common stock the risks relating to pfizers control of us and the potential business conflicts of interest between pfizer and us will continue to be relevant to our stockholders the liquidity of shares of our common stock in the market may be constrained for as long as pfizer continues to hold a significant position in our stock a lack of liquidity in our class a common stock could depress the price of our class a common stock 

our class b common stock may remain as a separate class 

each share of class b common stock held by pfizer or a subsidiary of pfizer is convertible at any time into one share of class a common stock at pfizers option but is not convertible if held by any other holder as a result if pfizer were to distribute shares of class b common stock in the distribution or otherwise dispose of its shares of class b common stock the new holders of such shares would not be able to convert the shares of class b common stock into class a common stock in such event we may apply to have our class b common stock listed on a securities exchange the existence of multiple classes of publicly traded common stock could depress the price of our class a common stock 

if pfizer were to distribute shares of class b common stock in the distribution or otherwise dispose of its shares of class b common stock our board of directors may in the future consider a proposal to amend our certificate of incorporation to mandatorily convert class b common stock to class a common stock on a shareforshare basis subject to the receipt of the required approval by our stockholders if the proposal is approved by our board of directors and presented to our stockholders a vote by i a majority of the shares of class a common stock and class b common stock voting together as a single class and ii a majority of the shares of the class b common stock voting as a separate class will be required for the proposal to be approved there will be no binding commitment by the board to and our board of directors may elect not to consider the issue or resolve to present any such proposal to our stockholders at any stockholders meeting moreover if presented our stockholders may not approve any such conversion 

if pfizer sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction our stockholders may not realize any changeofcontrol premium on shares of our common stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party 

pfizer owns a significant equity interest in our company and has the ability should it choose to do so to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction which if sufficient in size could result in a change of control of our company 

25   

the ability of pfizer to privately sell its shares of our common stock with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our publiclytraded class a common stock could prevent our stockholders from realizing any changeofcontrol premium on shares of our class a common stock that may otherwise accrue to pfizer on its private sale of our common stock additionally if pfizer privately sells its significant equity interest in our company we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders in addition if pfizer sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party our indebtedness may be subject to acceleration pfizer may terminate the rd collaboration agreement and license agreement and other transitional arrangements and our other commercial agreements and relationships could be impacted all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business as described herein and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the distribution or future sales by pfizer or others of our common stock or the perception that the distribution or such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

pfizer owns 100 of our outstanding class b common stock and no shares of our class a common stock giving pfizer 802  of the economic interest and the combined voting power in shares of our outstanding common stock other than with respect to the election of directors and 976  of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to the election of directors subject to the restrictions described in the paragraph below future sales of these shares in the public market will be subject to the volume and other restrictions of rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 or the securities act for so long as pfizer is deemed to be our affiliate unless the shares to be sold are registered with the securities and exchange commission or sec we are unable to predict with certainty whether or when pfizer will sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock to the extent it retains shares following the distribution or in the event the distribution does not occur the distribution or sale by pfizer of a substantial number of shares after the ipo or a perception that the distribution or such sales could occur could significantly reduce the market price of our class a common stock 

we our officers and directors and pfizer have agreed with the underwriters in the ipo that without the prior written consent of jp morgan securities llc merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated and morgan stanley  co llc we and they will not subject to certain exceptions and extensions during the period ending 180 days after january 31 2013 offer pledge sell contract to sell sell any option or contract to purchase purchase any option or contract to sell grant any option right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of directly or indirectly or enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers to another in whole or in part any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer sale pledge or disposition jp morgan securities llc merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated and morgan stanley  co llc may in their sole discretion and at any time without notice release all or any portion of the shares of our common stock subject to the lockup 

in addition if equity securities granted under the zoetis 2013 equity and incentive plan are sold or it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market the trading price of our class a common stock could decline substantially these sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements 

pfizer controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the nyse under these rules a listed company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including 

 while pfizer controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock we do not currently have and may not have in the future a majority of independent directors or corporate governance and compensation committees consisting entirely of independent directors and we will not be required to have written charters addressing these committees purposes and responsibilities or have annual performance evaluations of these committees accordingly our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 

as a result of the separation we will lose pfizers brand reputation capital base and other resources 

prior to the ipo as a business unit of pfizer we generally used the name “pfizer animal health” and we believe the association with pfizer contributed to our building relationships with our customers due to pfizers globally recognized brand and perceived highquality products the separation and distribution could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers which could result in reduced sales of our products 

the loss of pfizers scale capital base and financial strength may also prompt suppliers to reprice modify or terminate their relationships with us in addition pfizers reduction of its ownership of our company may cause some of our existing agreements and licenses to be terminated we cannot predict with certainty the effect the separation or the distribution may have on our business our clients vendors or other persons or whether our new brand zoetis will be accepted in the marketplace 

26   

pfizer may compete with us 

pfizer is not restricted from competing with us in the animal health business including as a result of acquiring a company that operates an animal health business due to the significant resources of pfizer including financial resources name recognition and knowhow resulting from the previous management of our business pfizer could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to engage in the type of business we conduct which may cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected 

certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer 

frank a damelio executive vice president chief financial officer and business operations for pfizer geno j germano president and general manager specialty care and oncology for pfizer douglas e giordano senior vice president worldwide business development for pfizer charles h hill executive vice president worldwide human resources for pfizer and amy w schulman executive vice president and general counsel business unit lead consumer healthcare for pfizer serve on our board of directors and are employees of pfizer in addition such directors may own pfizer common stock options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards these individuals holdings of pfizer common stock options to purchase common stock of pfizer or other equity awards may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons total assets their position at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards creates or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than the decisions have for us 

pfizer and its directors and officers have limited liability to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty 

our certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any contractual provision to the contrary pfizer will have no obligation to refrain from 

 under our certificate of incorporation neither pfizer nor any officer or director of pfizer except as provided in our certificate of incorporation is liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the separation the debtfordebt exchange the debtforequity exchange the transfer of cash proceeds of the senior notes offering to pfizer and the potential distribution we may not be able to engage in certain transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to pfizer andor its stockholders of the separation the debtfordebt exchange the debtforequity exchange the transfer of cash proceeds of the senior notes offering to pfizer the potential distribution and certain related transactions under the tax matters agreement we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the separation the debtfordebt exchange the debtforequity exchange the transfer of cash proceeds of the senior notes offering to pfizer the potential distribution and certain related transactions from being taxfree for us federal state local and foreign income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including taking certain actions with respect to our 3250 senior notes due 2023 which we refer to as the “2023 notes” and the use of our common stock to make acquisitions and equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—tax matters agreement 

the assets and resources that we acquired from pfizer in the separation may not be sufficient for us to operate as a standalone company and we may experience difficulty in separating our assets and resources from pfizer 

because we have not operated as a standalone company in the past we may have difficulty doing so we may need to acquire assets and resources in addition to those provided by pfizer to our company and in connection with the separation may also face difficulty in separating our assets from pfizers assets and integrating newly acquired assets into our business our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we have difficulty operating as a standalone company fail to acquire assets that prove to be important to our operations or incur unexpected costs in separating our assets from pfizers assets or integrating newly acquired assets 

we will incur significant charges in connection with the separation and incremental costs as a standalone public company 

we will need to replicate or replace certain functions systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access after the separation we may also need to make investments or hire additional employees to operate without the same access to pfizers existing operational and administrative infrastructure these initiatives may be costly to implement due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts the amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate and the timing of the incurrence of these costs is subject to change 

prior to the separation pfizer performed or supported many important corporate functions for our company our combined financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis following the separation many of these services will be governed by our transitional services agreement with pfizer under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these pfizer services for a fixed term established on a servicebyservice basis however we generally have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to pfizer partial reduction in the provision of any service requires pfizers consent in addition either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party upon prior written notice subject to limited cure periods 

we pay pfizer mutually agreedupon fees for these services based on pfizers costs of providing the services during the two years following the ipo the markup for these services will be 0  and for the remainder of the term of the agreement pfizer may introduce a markup of 7  which we believe is consistent with arms length pricing for the services provided however since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parentsubsidiary relationship the terms of the agreement including the fees charged for the services may be higher or lower 

27   

than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arms length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical financial statements third party costs are passed through to us at pfizers or its affiliates cost in addition while these services are being provided to us by pfizer our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited prior to the distribution if effected pfizer will have the unilateral right to resolve disputes under the transitional services agreement 

we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate thirdparty agreements on terms and conditions including cost comparable to those that we receive from pfizer under our transitional services agreement additionally after the agreement terminates we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from pfizer when we begin to operate these functions separately if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or are unable to obtain them from other providers we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs and our profitability may decline in addition we have historically received informal support from pfizer which may not be addressed in our transitional services agreement the level of this informal support may diminish or be eliminated in the future 

we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of our rd agreement with pfizer 

prior to the separation as a business unit of pfizer we had the ability to leverage pfizers proprietary compound library and database to identify research and develop compounds suitable as new product candidates for the animal health field as part of the separation we entered into an rd collaboration and license agreement with pfizer which we refer to as the “rd agreement” pursuant to the rd agreement subject to certain restrictions we will have continued access to pfizers compound library and database for a period of seven years and will have subject to pfizers approval the possibility to exclusively license compounds from pfizer that we develop under the rd agreement 

while the rd agreement is intended to bolster our postseparation rd capabilities certain terms of the rd agreement may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit including 

 each of the foregoing terms and pfizers other rights under the rd agreement and related licenses if any could limit our ability to realize the expected benefits of the rd agreement if we fail to achieve the expected benefits of the rd agreement it may be more difficult time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors we may experience delays in new product development which may result in our loss of the firstinclass products in a given therapeutic area 

for a summary description of the terms of the rd collaboration and license agreement see item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence— relationship with pfizer—research and development collaboration and license agreement 

we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property

risks related to our class a common stock 

the price of our class a common stock may fluctuate substantially 

our class a common stock has a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our class a common stock some factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section of our 2012 annual report are 

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

while we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders we may change our dividend policy at any time 

on march 28 2013 our board of directors declared the 2013 second quarter dividend of 0065 per share to be paid on june 6 2013 to holders of record on may 1 2013 although we currently intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our class a common stockholders and class b common stockholders we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders returns on stockholders investments will primarily depend on the appreciation if any in the price of our class a common stock we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings if any for use in the development and expansion of our business repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our class a common stock and class b common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the us impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our class a common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which we refer to as “our certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws which we refer to as “our bylaws” contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include 

 in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests

 item 2 properties 

we have rd operations colocated with certain of our manufacturing sites in australia brazil belgium china spain and the us to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing sites in addition we maintain rd operations at nonmanufacturing locations in belgium brazil canada india and the us as part of the separation pfizer conveyed to us its interest in each of these rd facilities with the exception of our mumbai india facility which we expect pfizer to transfer to us for agreed upon cash consideration in the future and in the interim we are leasing this facility from pfizer our largest rd facility is our owned us research and development site located in kalamazoo michigan which represents approximately 14 million square feet none of our other nonmanufacturing sites are more than 02 million square feet 

the address of our principal executive offices is currently 5 giralda farms madison new jersey 07940 in march 2013 we announced that we signed an office lease in florham park new jersey and will be relocating our principal executive offices in the first half of 2013 

following the separation our global manufacturing network will be comprised of 13  “anchor” and 16  “satellite” manufacturing sites and pfizer will continue to manufacture products for us at 14  pfizer sites located in 13  countries included in these 14  pfizer sites is our facility in guarulhos brazil where pfizer will continue its manufacturing operations for a period of time these 14  pfizer sites consist of sites operated by pfizer that immediately prior to the separation predominantly manufactured human health products the largest manufacturing site in our global manufacturing network is our manufacturing site located in kalamazoo michigan which represents approximately 06 million square feet no other site in our global manufacturing network was more than 06 million square feet in addition our global manufacturing network will continue to be supplemented by approximately 200  cmos see item 1 business—manufacturing and supply chain  and item 13   certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with pfizer—master manufacturing and supply agreements 

we own or lease various additional properties for other business purposes including office space warehouses and logistics centers in addition under the transitional services agreement we entered into with pfizer pfizer granted us continued access to certain of its premises occupied by our employees prior to the ipo 

we believe that our existing properties as supplemented by sites operated by cmos including pfizer and access to pfizer facilities provided under the transitional services agreement are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business these claims and litigation may include among other things allegations of violation of us and foreign competition law labor laws consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability intellectual property securities breach of contract and tort we operate in multiple jurisdictions and as a result a claim in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatory penalties in other jurisdictions we intend to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation 

at this time in the opinion of management the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our combined results of operations financial condition or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved in addition regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes such matters are costly divert managements attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation even if resolved in our favor

market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

tableend on january 31 2013  our registration statement on form s1 file no 333183254 was declared effective for the ipo pursuant to which we registered the offering and sale of 99015000 shares of our class a common stock including 12915000 additional shares pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the ipo was completed on february 6 2013  at a public offering price of 2600 per share for an aggregate gross offering price of approximately 257 billion 

instead of selling shares of our class a common stock directly to the underwriters for cash in the ipo pfizer first exchanged the shares of our class a common stock to be sold in the ipo with certain of the underwriters which we refer to in such role as the “debtforequity exchange parties” for outstanding indebtedness of pfizer held by the debtforequity exchange parties the debtforequity exchange parties then sold shares to the underwriters for cash this debtforequity exchange occurred on the settlement date of the ipo immediately prior to the settlement of the debtforequity exchange parties sale of the shares to the underwriters 

we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the debtforequity exchange parties including any shares sold by the debtforequity exchange parties in connection with the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the managing underwriters were jp morgan securities llc merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated and morgan stanley  co llc as a result of the offering the debtforequity exchange parties received net proceeds of approximately 248 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 95 million 

shares of our class a common stock are traded on the nyse symbol zts shares of our class a common stock have only been publicly traded since february 1 2013  as a result we have not set forth quarterly information with respect to the high and low prices for our common stock and the dividends declared on our common stock for the two most recent fiscal years as of march 14 2013 there were 32145 stockholders of record of our class a common stock as of the date of this 2012 annual report pfizer owns 100 of our outstanding class b common stock and no shares of our class a common stock giving pfizer 802  of the economic interest and the combined voting power in shares of our outstanding common stock other than with respect to the election of directors and 976  of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to the election of directors see item 1 business—recent developments  

we did not purchase any of our equity securities nor did we sell any securities other than to pfizer upon our formation pursuant to any unregistered offering during the period covered by this report 

dividend policy 

we expect to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of our class a common stock and class b common stock of 0065  per share subject to the approval of our board of directors on march 28 2013 our board of directors declared the 2013 second quarter dividend of 0065 per share to be paid on june 6 2013 to holders of record on may 1 2013 

the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our class a common stock and class b common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs cash flows available in the us impact on our effective tax rate indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the instruments governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends therefore no assurance is given that we will pay any dividends to our common stockholders or as to the amount of any such dividends if our board of directors determines to do so 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock will depend on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance as reflected in the results of our operations our financial condition and our cash flows this mda should be read in conjunction with our combined financial statements and notes to combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the discussion in this mda contains a description of our historical performance for periods in which we operated as a business unit of pfizer as well as forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a risk factors  and in the forwardlooking statements and factors that may affect future results  and comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer  sections of this mda 

this mda is organized as follows 

overview of our business 

we are a global leader in the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals for more than 60 years as a business unit of pfizer we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them 

the animal health medicines and vaccines industry is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions as a result of these differences among other things we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments within each of these operating segments we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs our four operating segments are the united states us europeafricamiddle east euafme canadalatin america clar and asiapacific apac see notes to combined financial statements— note 17 segment geographic and other revenue information  

on february 6 2013 an initial public offering ipo of our class a common stock was completed which represented approximately 198 of our total outstanding shares currently pfizer owns 100 of our outstanding class b common stock and no shares of our class a common 

34   

stock giving pfizer 802 of the economic interest and the combined voting power in shares of our outstanding common stock other than with respect to the election of directors and 976 of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock with respect to the election of directors on february 1 2013 our class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “zts” prior to and in connection with the ipo we completed a 365 billion senior notes offering and pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of their animal health business we refer to the transactions to separate our business from pfizer as described here and elsewhere in the 2012 annual report as the separation for additional information see notes to combined financial statements— note 19 subsequent events 

pfizer has informed us that it may make a taxfree distribution to its shareholders of all or a portion of its remaining equity interest in us which may include one or more distributions effected as a dividend to all pfizer shareholders one or more distributions in exchange for pfizer shares or other securities or any combination thereof we refer to any such potential distribution as the distribution pfizer has no obligation to pursue or consummate any further dispositions of its ownership interest in us including through the distribution by any specified date or at all 

we directly market our products to livestock producers and veterinarians located in approximately 70 countries across north america europe africa asia australia and latin america and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets such as brazil china and india we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenues across emerging markets as a whole emerging markets contributed 26  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products 

we believe our investments in the industry’s largest sales organization including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists our highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers our rd efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers 

our performance 

a summary of our 2012 performance compared to 2011 follows 



our operating environment 

industry 

the animal health industry which focuses on both livestock and companion animals is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle both beef and dairy swine poultry sheep and fish livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include 

 the primary companion animal species are dogs cats and horses industry sources indicate that companion animals improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of pet owners factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines and vaccines include 

 product development initiatives 

our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition we believe we are an industry leader in animal health rd with a track record of generating new products and brand lifecycle developments the majority of our rd programs focus on brand lifecycle development which is defined as rd programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations 

35   

perceptions of product quality safety and reliability 

we believe that animal health medicines and vaccines customers value highquality manufacturing and reliability of supply the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty which we believe often continues after the loss of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products and animal health products generally by our customers veterinarians and endusers 

the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from foodproducing animals to human pathogens and the causality of that transfer are the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion in some countries this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some foodproducing animals regardless of the route of administration topical oral intramuscularsubcutaneous injections or intravenous these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take restrictive actions even when there is scientific uncertainty historically antibacterials for livestock have represented a significant portion of our revenues we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals 

the overall economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the current challenging economic environment growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth particularly in many emerging markets certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by the economic downturn which could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers 

however the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs including feed and the use of these products improves livestock producers’ economic outcomes as a result demand for our products has typically been more stable than demand for other production inputs similarly industry sources report that pet owners indicate a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle including entertainment clothing and household goods before reducing spending on pet care 

competition 

the animal health industry is competitive although our business is the largest by revenues in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry we face competition in the regions and sectors in which we compete principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product some of these methods include new product development quality price service and promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses in addition to competition from established market participants there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future in certain markets we also compete with companies that produce generic products but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market for example the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the us however there is no large wellcapitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry 

weather conditions and the availability of natural resources 

the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weatherrelated pressures from pests such as ticks as a result we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations 

in addition livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources including large supplies of fresh water their animals’ health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods droughts or other weather conditions in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water livestock producers may purchase less of our products 

for example the drought currently impacting the us is considered the worst in many years impacting both the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pasture the decrease in harvested corn has resulted in higher corn prices which has impacted the profitability of livestock producers of cattle pork and poultry higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock size that may result in reduced spending on animal health products reduced availability of grazing pasture may also force cattle producers to cull their herds fewer heads of cattle would result in reduced demand for our products a prolonged drought could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition our current expectations are that the drought may affect our performance in 2013 factors influencing the magnitude and timing of any effects of a drought on our performance include but may not be limited to weather patterns and herd management decisions taken by livestock producers 

disease outbreaks 

sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animalderived food products or result in reduced exports of such products either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions which may reduce demand for our products also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere alternatively sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase for example in 2012 we successfully launched a vaccine for horses against the deadly hendra virus in australia 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenues and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates our products are sold in more than 120 countries and as a result our revenues are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in 2012 approximately 54 of our revenues were 

36   

denominated in foreign currencies as a business unit of pfizer and under pfizer’s global cash management system we sought to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operating means including managing samecurrency revenues in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities going forward we will evaluate if a similar approach to managing foreign exchange risk is appropriate for our company as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the brazilian real the australian dollar and other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses and consequently net income exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financials and directly impact operations these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances approximately 46 of our total revenues occur in us dollars and in 2012 our yearoveryear revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 4  from changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar 

for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivar per us dollar we incurred a foreign currency loss immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets and we will experience ongoing adverse impacts to earnings as our revenues costs and expenses will be translated into us dollars at lower rates the impacts are not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

our growth strategies 

we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies 

 components of revenues and costs and expenses 

our revenues costs and expenses are reported for the fiscal year ended december 31 for each year presented except for operations outside the us for which the financial information is included in our combined financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented 

revenues 

our revenues are primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat livestock and companion animals generally our products are sold to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of different customers in 2012 our top selling product line the ceftiofur line contributed approximately 7  of our revenues the ceftiofur line and our next two top selling products revolution and draxxin contributed approximately 20  of our revenues our top ten bestselling product lines contributed approximately 39  of our revenues for additional information regarding our products including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1 or more of our revenues in 2012 see item 1 business—products  

costs and expenses 

costs of sales  consist primarily of cost of materials facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products when relevant 

selling general and administrative sga  expenses consist of among other things the internal and external costs of marketing promotion advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology facilities legal finance human resources business development public affairs and procurement 

research and development rd  expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product rd and brand lifecycle development overhead costs associated with rd operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications we do not disaggregate rd expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business 

37   

amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finitelife intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations these assets consist of but are not limited to developed technology brands and trademarks 

restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs  consist of all restructuring charges those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reductionproductivity initiatives as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses restructuring charges are associated with employees assets and activities that will not continue in the company acquisitionrelated costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses such as the king animal health business in 2011 and the fort dodge animal health business in 2009 and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes 

other incomedeductions—net  consist primarily of various items including net interest incomeexpense net gainslosses on asset disposals royaltyrelated income and certain asset impairment charges 

comparability of historical results and our relationship with pfizer 

during the periods covered by the combined financial statements in this 2012 annual report we operated solely as a business unit of pfizer the combined financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pfizer and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the animal health business of pfizer these combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as a standalone public company during the periods presented in addition the historical combined financial statements may not be reflective of what our results of operations comprehensive incomeloss financial position equity or cash flows might be in the future as a standalone public company 

for a detailed description of the basis of presentation and an understanding of the limitations of the predictive value of the historical combined financial statements see notes to combined financial statements— note 2 basis of presentation 

the historical balance sheets may not be comparable to the opening balance sheet of the standalone company which will reflect the transfer by pfizer of substantially all of its animal health business to us noncomparable elements will include for example the allocation of pfizer debt which was not transferred and cash and cash equivalents which were adjusted in conjunction with the completion of the ipo 

our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future as a standalone public company with respect to support functions for example our historical combined financial statements include expense allocations for certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within pfizer such as expenses for business technology facilities legal finance human resources and to a lesser extent business development public affairs and procurement among others pursuant to agreements with pfizer pfizer will continue to provide us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreedupon fees and we will incur other costs to replace the services and resources that will not be provided by pfizer we will also incur additional costs as a standalone public company as a standalone public company our total costs related to such support functions may differ from the costs that were historically allocated to us from pfizer we estimate that these costs may exceed the allocated amounts for full year 2012 by a range of approximately 15 million to 25 million in 2013 in addition we expect to incur internal costs to implement certain new systems including infrastructure and an enterprise resource planning system while our legacy systems are being fully supported by pfizer under the transitional services agreement we estimate these costs to range between approximately 30 million to 40 million in 2013 and 2014 

we also expect to incur certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming a standalone public company including new branding which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging the creation of a standalone infrastructure site separation and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs we expect these costs to range between approximately 170 million to 200 million in 2013 and 70 million to 100 million in 2014 these estimates exclude the impact of any depreciation or amortization of capitalized separation expenditures in addition many of our employees currently participate in certain pfizer equity award plans upon any distribution pfizer will accelerate the vesting of or in some cases the settlement of on a pro rata basis certain of the outstanding pfizer equity awards which will result in the recognition of additional expense 

some of our products are manufactured at sites that will be retained by pfizer or that were operated by pfizer under a saleleaseback arrangement in 2013 pursuant to the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer we purchase these products from pfizer the historical combined statements of income include allocations of certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by the manufacturing sites that would not have been charged to us under the master manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer had such agreement been in effect in the periods presented such as operating variances as well as purchase price and volume variances under a certain threshold the costs allocated in the historical combined statements of income are higher than the amounts that would have been charged by pfizer under the master manufacturing and supply agreement had it been in effect during the periods presented by approximately 10 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and approximately 14 million for the year ended december 31 2011 in connection with the ipo we and pfizer have entered into certain agreements that will provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with pfizer see notes to combined financial statements— note 19d subsequent events—agreements with pfizer 

public company expenses 

as a result of the ipo we became subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act we will have additional procedures and practices to establish as a standalone public company as a result we will incur additional costs including internal audit investor relations stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 

recent significant acquisitions and governmentmandated divestitures 

the assets liabilities operating results and cash flows of acquired businesses are included in our results commencing from their respective acquisition dates 

38   

the king animal health business kah was acquired by pfizer as part of its acquisition of king pharmaceuticals inc acquired on january 31 2011 strengthening our position in the poultry business with a medicated feed additives business and other poultry products and further strengthening our position in the cattle and swine businesses see notes to combined financial statements— note 4a acquisitions divestitures and certain investments—acquisition of king animal health  our combined financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 reflect eleven months of kah’s us operations and ten months of kah’s international operations 

the fort dodge animal health business fdah was acquired by pfizer as part of its acquisition of wyeth acquired on october 15 2009 adding to our portfolio a broad array of companion animal and livestock brands and strengthening our vaccine portfolio including a complementary poultry vaccines business in connection with this acquisition we made certain governmentmandated divestitures see notes to combined financial statements— note 4c acquisitions divestitures and certain investments—divestitures  

delays in establishing new operating subsidiaries 

due to local regulatory and operational requirements in certain nonus jurisdictions the transfer to us of certain assets and liabilities of pfizers animal health business has not yet legally occurred we do not expect these assets and liabilities to be material to our combined financial statements individually or in the aggregate 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates 

in presenting our financial statements in conformity with us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures for a description of our significant accounting policies see notes to combined financial statements— note 3 significant accounting policies  

we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our combined financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult subjective and complex judgments and therefore could have the greatest impact on our financial statements i acquisitions  note 3c  ii fair value  note 3d  iii revenues  note 3f  iv asset impairment reviews  note 3j  and v contingencies  notes 3n and 3q

revenues 

our gross product revenues are subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent sales returns and revenue incentives for example 

 if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience our results could be materially affected although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are heavily dependent on estimates and assumptions historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program type of customer and geographic location 

amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to combined financial statements— note 3b significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

asset impairment reviews 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present in addition we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived assets at least annually when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets 

our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to combined financial statements— note 3j significant accounting policies—amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  and for deferred tax assets in note 3n significant accounting policies—deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

39   

 our impairment reviews of most of our longlived assets depend heavily on the determination of fair value as defined by us gaap and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions see notes to combined financial statements— note 3b significant accounting policies—estimates and assumptions  

intangible assets other than goodwill 

as a result of our intangible asset impairment review work we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 

we recorded the following identifiable intangible asset impairment charges in other incomedeductions—net  

 when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we use an income approach specifically the multiperiod excess earnings method also known as the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections the impact of technological risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment in general identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 20 million as of december 31 2012 and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinitelived brand assets none at december 31 2012 iprd assets are higherrisk assets because rd is an inherently risky activity newly acquired and recently impaired indefinitelived assets are more vulnerable to impairment because the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period as such immediately after acquisition or impairment even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge 

for a description of our accounting policy see notes to combined financial statements— note 3j significant accounting policies—amortization of intangible assets depreciation and certain longlived assets  

goodwill 

as a result of our goodwill impairment review work we concluded that none of our goodwill is impaired as of december 31 2012 while all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to impairment we do not believe that the risk of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units is significant at this time 

when we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we use the income approach the income approach is a forwardlooking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then we apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see forwardlooking statements and information that may affect future results

as a result of the impact of a recent significant acquisition and the related governmentmandated divestitures on the revenue numbers in our statements of income for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the growth trend on our existing portfolio from year to year is not readily apparent we believe that it is not only important to understand overall revenue growth but also existing portfolio growth year over year as such we utilize “base revenue growth” base revenue growth is defined as revenue growth excluding the impact of incremental revenues from recent significant acquisitions governmentmandated divestitures and foreign exchange

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

 we have incurred significant direct costs for restructuring and integrating acquired businesses such as kah on january 31 2011 and fdah on october 15 2009 among others and in connection with our ongoing cost reductionproductivity initiatives 

our acquisitionrelated costs primarily related to restructuring charges for employees assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company the majority of these charges are termination costs but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed some facility rationalization efforts our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes 

the costs associated with our cost reductionproductivity initiatives are predominantly termination costs associated with plant closings initiated by pfizers manufacturing division as well as termination costs associated with reorganization of our commercial operations in europe these cost reductionproductivity initiatives are ongoing

provision for taxes on income 



certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

the income tax provision in the combined statements of income has been calculated as if zoetis filed a separate tax return and includes tax costs and benefits such as uncertain tax positions repatriation decisions and audit settlements among others 

during the third quarter of 2012 pfizer reached a settlement with the us internal revenue service irs with respect to the audits of the pfizer inc tax returns for the years 2006 through 2008 the settlement resulted in an income tax benefit to zoetis of approximately 293 million representing tax and interest 

during the first quarter of 2011 pfizer reached a settlement with the irs with respect to the audits of the wyeth tax returns for the years 2002 through 2005 the settlement resulted in an income tax benefit to zoetis of approximately 95 million representing tax and interest 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 pfizer reached a settlement with the irs related to issues pfizer had appealed with respect to the audits of the pfizer inc tax returns for the years 2002 through 2005 as well as the pharmacia audit for the year 2003 through the date of merger with pfizer april 16 2003 the settlement resulted in an income tax benefit to zoetis of approximately 334 million representing tax and interest

 adjusted net income 

general description of adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure 

adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicine and vaccine products prior to considering certain income statement elements we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitionrelated costs and certain significant items the adjusted net income measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis 

the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized 

47   

 despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement adjusted net income is a nongaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore has limits in its usefulness to investors because of its nonstandardized definition adjusted net income unlike us gaap net income may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance 

we also recognize that as an internal measure of performance the adjusted net income measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performancemanagement process solely to this metric a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance 

purchase accounting adjustments   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts primarily associated with the pharmacia animal health business acquired in 2003 fdah acquired in 2009 and kah acquired in 2011 include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increasedecrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets therefore the adjusted net income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges 

while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs previously have been expensed 

a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances for example our rd costs in total and in the periods presented may have been different our speed to commercialization and resulting revenues if any may have been different or our costs to manufacture may have been different in addition our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers as such in total there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets 

acquisitionrelated costs   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction integration restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with significant business combinations or netasset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions for example in the context of a business combination can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 

the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy for example due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business the closure of excess facilities can take several years as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda andor other regulatory authorities 

48   

certain significant items   

adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items certain significant items represent substantive unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature unusual in this context may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products that we no longer sell while not allinclusive examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major nonacquisitionrelated restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term such as those related to our nonacquisitionrelated costreduction and productivity initiatives amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by us gaap certain intangible asset impairments adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions the impact of adopting certain significant eventdriven tax legislation or charges related to legal matters see notes to combined financial statements— note 16 commitments and contingencies  our normal ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items 

reconciliation and detailed descriptions 

a reconciliation of net income attributable to zoetis as reported under us gaap to nongaap adjusted net income follows 

certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

 throughout 2012 we have undertaken a number of internal reorganization steps designed to improve our operational efficiency and reduce costs we have been granted an incentive tax ruling in belgium effective december 1 2012 that provides for incentive tax rates on certain of our belgium earnings through 2017 as a result of these items which will change our jurisdictional mix of earnings among other impacts we expect that our future effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income will be lower than historical levels

 analysis of the combined statements of comprehensive incomeloss 

virtually all changes in other comprehensive income for all periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments these chang es result from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until realized specifically the changes to accumulated other comprehensive loss  for 2012 reflect the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and the brazilian real t he changes for 2011 reflect the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and the indian rupee partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro the changes for 2010 reflect the weakening of the us dollar against the euro australian dollar and the brazilian real 

analysis of the combined balance sheets 

for information about certain of our financial assets and liabilities including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts  and allocated longterm debt  see analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources  below 

for inventories  the increase reflects production increases due to increased demand achieving higher targeted inventory levels for certain products and changes in our supply points 

for accounts payable  the increase was primarily related to increases in trade accounts payable due to timing of payments and increases in vat payable 

for other current liabilities  the overall increase is due primarily to accruals for inventory in the us and an increase in deferred revenue partially offset by a decrease in environmental reserves due to a favorable settlement see notes to combined financial statements— note 6 other incomedeductions—net 

for other noncurrent liabilities  the decrease reflects the movement of certain balances to other current liabilities  and certain changes to estimates related to contingency reserves see notes to combined financial statements— note 16a commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings 

virtually all of our assets and liabilities as of december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 also reflect changes due to the impact of foreign exchange

 analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe our cash on hand our operating cash flows and our anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs this may be subject to the environment in which we operate risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph 

over the last five years the global financial markets have undergone and may continue to experience significant volatility and disruption the timing and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional macroeconomic business and financial disruptions may arise as markets change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing 

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow

 for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see analysis of the combined balance sheets  and analysis of the combined statements of cash flows  

in december 2012 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a fiveyear 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which became effective in february 2013 and expires in december 2017 the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio of 4351 for fiscal year 2013 3951 for fiscal year 2014 3501 for fiscal year 2015 and 3001 thereafter in addition the credit facility contains other customary covenants subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to 15 billion the credit facility became available for borrowings upon the completion of the ipo and there are currently no borrowings under credit facility 

domestic and international shortterm funds 

many of our operations are conducted outside the us as part of the animal health assets transferred to us by pfizer on january 28 2013 we received significant portions of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held internationally approximately 60 of cash transferred was held outside the us going forward the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as businessdevelopment activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us federal state and local income tax payments we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us no accrual for us taxes is provided 

global economic conditions 

the challenging economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as markets change we continue to monitor our liquidity position there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

subsequent events 

on january 28 2013 we issued 365 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes the senior notes offering in a private placement with an original issue discount of 10 million including the 10 billion of our senior notes that were transferred to pfizer and subsequently sold by pfizer on january 28 2013 pfizer transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its animal health business in exchange for all of our class a and class b common stock 10 billion of the 365 billion senior notes and an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the cash proceeds received by us from the remaining 265 billion senior notes issued the senior note offering resulted in a change to our balance sheet see notes to combined financial statements— note 19a subsequent events—pro forma information  after completion of the senior notes offering the longterm debt was 364 billion 

on february 6 2013  an ipo of 99015000  shares of our class a common stock including the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option at a price of 2600  per share was completed we did not receive any of the net proceeds from the ipo immediately following the ipo there were 99015000  outstanding shares of class a common stock and 400985000  outstanding shares of class b common stock 

in february 2013 we entered into a commercial paper program with a capacity of up to 10 billion while no commercial paper has been issued under the commercial paper program at this time we may incur indebtedness under this program in the future

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

our executive officers whose compensation is discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis or cda and who we refer to as our named executive officers or neos are juan ramón alaix chief executive officer or ceo richard a passov executive vice president and chief financial officer or cfo kristin c peck executive vice president and group president catherine a knupp executive vice president and president of research and development and clinton a lewis jr executive vice president and president of us operations 

background 

prior to the ipo we operated as a business unit of pfizer as a result pfizer determined the 2012 compensation of our employees including our neos accordingly the compensation arrangements discussed in this cda are those of pfizer these compensation arrangements as well as the compensation program we expect to adopt when the pfizer compensation plans no longer apply to us are discussed below because our neos other than ms peck were not executive officers of pfizer their cash compensation was initially determined by pfizers senior management in accordance with the philosophy adopted by the compensation committee of pfizers board of directors but was not specifically determined or reviewed by the compensation committee of pfizers board of directors as a member of pfizers executive leadership team ms pecks cash compensation was reviewed and determined by pfizers compensation committee with the advice of the committees independent consultant 

philosophy goals and principles of pfizers executive compensation program 

pfizers executive compensation philosophy which is set by the compensation committee of pfizers board of directors is to align each executives compensation with pfizers shortterm and longterm performance and to provide the compensation and incentives needed to 

100   

attract motivate and retain key executives who are crucial to pfizers longterm success a significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of pfizers executives including our neos is directly related to pfizers stock price performance and to other performance factors that measure progress against the goals of pfizers strategic and operating plans as well as pfizers performance against that of the pharmaceutical peer group described below 

pfizer seeks to implement its compensation philosophy and achieve the goals of its program by following three key principles 

 pfizers executive compensation framework 

in support of its compensation philosophy pfizer targets the median compensation values of both a peer group of pharmaceutical companies and a general industry comparator group to determine an appropriate total value and mix of pay for our executives pfizers compensation committee reviews these peer groups on an annual basis 

pfizers pharmaceutical peer group for 2012 consisted of the following companies which were selected based on their size and market capitalization and the complexity of their businesses as well as the availability of comparative data pfizers compensation committee recognizes that while data is available on the performance of pfizers nonusbased peer companies the compensation data is limited in terms of comparable benchmarks and other information as compared to peers based in the us 



the general industry comparator group for 2012 was selected by pfizer’s compensation committee from other industry sectors based on the same criteria as described above 



given the differences between pfizer and us in industry focus market capitalization and other factors that impact executive compensation we have selected a different group of peer companies as described under “— our anticipated compensation program postipo ” 

applying pfizers compensation framework to executive positions 

pfizer uses median compensation data for similar positions in its pharmaceutical peer and general industry comparator groups as well as an evaluation of internal equity among pfizer executives as a guide in setting compensation targets for each of its executives including our neos each compensation target is assigned a numbered salary grade to simplify the compensation administration process and help maintain internal equity 

pfizer uses salary grades to determine the preliminary salary recommendation target annual incentive award opportunity and target longterm equity incentive award value for each executive position each salary grade is expressed as a range with minimum midpoint and maximum salary levels minimum and maximum salary range levels for each grade are set 25 below and above the salary range midpoint which is 

101   

intended to approximate the bottom and top quartiles for positions assigned to that grade this framework provides a guide for pfizers compensation committee determinations the actual total compensation andor amount of each compensation element for an individual executive may be more or less than this median 

overview of pfizers compensation program design 

this section will explain how pfizer determined the design of its 2012 executive compensation program as it relates to our neos 

role of pfizers compensation consultant  since 2003 pfizers compensation committee has engaged the firm of frederic w cook  co represented by george paulin its chief executive officer as the committees independent compensation consultant below are some of the consultants primary responsibilities 

 elements of pay 

base salary  in accordance with pfizer practice base salaries for our neos have generally been determined by evaluating the responsibilities of the executives position the executives experience and the competitive marketplace the competitive marketplace has been determined with the use of survey data as described under “— role of pfizers compensation consultant ” future base salary adjustments for our neos are expected to take into account changes in the executives responsibilities the executives performance and changes in the competitive marketplace 

annual incentive plan  for 2012 eligible employees including our neos participated in pfizers annual incentive program—the global performance plan or gpp the gpp utilizes a funded pool based on pfizers performance on three financial metrics total revenue revenue weighted 40 adjusted diluted earnings per share weighted 40 and cash flow from operations cash flow weighted 20 the gpp pool funding percentage can range from 0 to 200 of target award levels however the pool is not funded unless performance exceeds a threshold level earned individual payouts also can range from 0 to 200 of target and reflect allocations from the available earned pool based on corporate business unitfunction and individual performance 

as indicated by the following table pfizers actual 2012 performance exceeded the targets for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share and exceeded the threshold for cash flow the 2012 amounts below exclude the results from the nutrition business unit of pfizer which was sold in 2012 



 our neos 2012 annual incentive awards were based on

the threshold target and maximum incentive award opportunities for each of our neos for 2012 are set forth in the “2012 grants of planbased awards table” 

2012 longterm equity incentives  a key element of pfizers compensation program is longterm equity incentive awards granted under the pfizer inc 2004 stock plan as amended and restated or the 2004 stock plan in 2012 our employees received equity awards under the 2004 stock plan intended to

tsrus vest in three years and are settled on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the date of grant the number of shares that may be earned for each tsru is equal to the difference between the settlement price the 20day average of the closing prices of pfizer common stock prior to settlement and the grant price the closing price of pfizer common stock on the date of grant plus the value of dividend equivalents accumulated over the term subject to the results being positive 

psas vest in three years and provide an opportunity for executives to receive shares of pfizer common stock contingent upon pfizer corporate performance in relation to the performance of the pfizer pharmaceutical peer group over a designated period of time generally three years the number of shares that may be earned under the psas over the performance period is based on pfizers total shareholder return or tsr defined as change in stock price plus dividends relative to the tsr of the pfizer pharmaceutical peer group and ranges from 0 to 200 of the initial award dividend equivalents are applied to the shares actually earned 

prior to the ipo the amounts terms and conditions of the equity awards granted to our neos were determined by pfizer our equity awards going forward will be determined by our compensation committee

insurance plans  pfizer provides a number of health and family security benefits such as medical insurance dental insurance life insurance and longterm disability insurance these benefits are available to all us and puerto ricobased employees including our neos and are comparable to those provided by the companies in the pfizer pharmaceutical and general industry comparator groups these programs are designed to provide certain basic quality of life benefits and protections to pfizer employees including our neos and at the same time enhance pfizers attractiveness as an employer of choice the annual cost of benefits for each of our neos for these pfizer benefits ranges from approximately 13000 to 25000 

pension and savings plans  pfizer maintains qualified defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of all its eligible us and puerto ricobased employees including our neos hired prior to january 1 2011 for those us employees earning in excess of the code limit 250000 for 2012 including our neos pfizer maintains related supplemental benefit restoration plans the provisions and features of the qualified defined benefit pension plans and the related supplemental benefit restoration plans apply to all participants in those plans including our neos pfizer also maintains savings plans that permit participants to make pretax aftertax andor roth contributions of a portion of their eligible pay up to certain limits in addition pfizer maintains nonqualified savings plans that permit eligible participants to make pretax contributions in excess of tax law limitations on qualified plans pfizer provides matching contributions with respect to employee contributions up to certain limits the provisions and features of the qualified savings plans and the related nonqualified supplemental savings plans apply to all participants in those plans including our neos these plans are described in the narrative accompanying the “2012 pension benefits table” and the “2012 nonqualified deferred compensation table” below 

postemployment compensation  pfizers senior leadership council separation plan or the slc separation plan provides a competitive level of severance protection for certain senior executives to help pfizer attract and retain key talent our neos participate in the slc separation plan which provides severance upon a termination of employment without cause equal to the sum of onetimes pay defined as base salary and target bonus in addition the executive would be eligible for 12 months of health and insurance benefits continuation at active rates plus outplacement assistance as offered by pfizer 

effective november 1 2012 pfizer adopted a severance plan the sale of business severance plan to cover certain of our executives including each of our neos in the event of a sale of the pfizer animal health business the sale of business severance plan is intended to give key executives assurances as to severance pay and benefits in the event of a sale of the pfizer animal health business to a third party in order to allow them to focus on making decisions that are in the best overall interests of pfizer and zoetis the sale of business severance plan provides benefits in the event that an executives employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause or the executive resigns for good reason within two years following the consummation of a sale to a third party the sale of business severance plan would not be triggered by the distribution for our neos the severance plan provides for a cash payment equal to the sum of two times the executives base salary plus two times the executives bonus target each determined as of the date of termination in addition the executive would be eligible for 12 months of health and insurance benefits continuation at active rates plus outplacement assistance as offered by pfizer payments made under the sale of business severance plan would be offset to the extent that severance is payable under the slc separation plan in order to avoid duplication of benefits severance payments and benefits for our neos under the slc separation plan and the sale of business severance plan are described in “— estimated benefits upon termination ” 

our anticipated compensation program 

the following section describes the compensation program we anticipate implementing for our senior executives including our neos when the pfizer compensation program no longer applies to us pfizer has engaged compensation advisory partners cap on our behalf to assist in designing our executive compensation program our compensation committee expects to retain its own compensation consultant to advise the compensation committee in its compensation planning decisions 

zoetis compensation committee 

our compensation committee which was appointed by our board of directors will determine the appropriate compensation plans and programs for our executives our compensation committee will review and evaluate our executive compensation plans and programs to ensure they are aligned with our compensation philosophy 

104   

peer group analysis 

based upon the advice of cap we have identified the following eleven companies as our “core” peers 



based on their sales and market capitalization as well as the nature of their businesses histories industries and the availability of relevant comparative compensation data we believe this core peer group is appropriate given the unique nature of our business and industry 

in addition to these eleven core peer companies we have identified six additional companies biorad laboratories celgene hospira mettlertoledo international perkinelmer and perrigo that have similar sales and market capitalization but do not have readily available comparative compensation data that we will use as “supplemental” peer companies as appropriate we will utilize the proxy data for these supplemental peer companies for purposes of determining comparative compensation for certain of our executives 

in addition to the data from these peer companies additional data from similarlysized companies in life sciences and general industry may be used for benchmarking purposes to ensure robust data 

zoetis 2013 equity and incentive plan 

the zoetis 2013 equity and incentive plan the “equity plan” is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan that permits us to grant both equitybased and nonequity based compensation awards to employees of zoetis and its subsidiaries and to our directors the equity plan became effective january 28 2013 

in order to provide longterm incentives to and facilitate the retention of our employees we granted restricted stock units and stock options or other awards as appropriate with respect to our employees in nonus jurisdictions under the equity plan to approximately 1700 of our employees including each of our neos in connection with the ipo we refer to these grants as the “2013 equity grants” these 2013 equity grants represent the longterm incentive compensation component of such individuals total 2013 compensation 

these awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant the 2013 equity grant target value for each employee was based on each employees job level the value of the award to an employee was split equally among restricted stock units and stock options or such other awards as appropriate with respect to our employees in nonus jurisdictions the approximate aggregate target value of the 2013 equity grants to all employees is 45 million of that amount the approximate target values of the 2013 equity grants to our neos are as follows mr alaix  40 million mr passov  14 million ms peck  112 million mr lewis  06 million and dr knupp  06 million however the actual value realized by the recipients of the 2013 equity grants will depend on a number of factors including future vesting and the future market value of zoetis shares 

stock ownership and holding requirements 

we have adopted share ownership guidelines for our neos our guidelines require mr alaix to hold zoetis shares with a value of five times his annual base salary mr passov and ms peck to hold zoetis shares with a value of three times their respective base salaries and all remaining executive officers to hold zoetis shares with a value of two times their respective base salaries before they can sell any shares upon the exercise of options or the vesting of other awards our neos will have five years from the establishment of the guidelines to achieve the share ownership requirement 

clawback policy 

we are developing a clawback policy whereby our compensation committee may if permitted by law make retroactive adjustments to any cash or equitybased incentive compensation paid to neos and other executives where a payment is predicated upon the achievement of specified financial results that are the subject of a subsequent restatement where applicable we may seek to recover any amount determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer in addition we expect that the equity incentive awards that we grant will contain such compensation recovery provisions our compensation committee will monitor the regulatory developments related to clawbacks and expects to modify its policy to the extent necessary once final rules are issued 

hedging policy 

we adopted a policy prohibiting any of our directors or employees including the neos from “hedging” their ownership in shares of our common stock or other equitybased interests in our company including by engaging in short sales or trading in derivative securities relating to our common stock 

tax deductibility of neo compensation 

section 162m of the code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than 1 million paid in any fiscal year to the ceo and four other most highly compensated executive officers other than the cfo as of the end of any fiscal year none of the compensation paid to our neos in 2012 was subject to the limitations on deductibility under section 162m because our neos were not among the executives of pfizer who were subject to section 162m 

105   

we generally intend to structure our equitybased and cashbased incentive awards to meet the exception under section 162m for “performancebased” compensation taking advantage of transitional rules under section 162m that will apply to zoetis such that these amounts are fully deductible for tax purposes rsus do not qualify as “performancebased” compensation consequently certain of our neos may be required to defer the receipt of rsus however to maintain flexibility in compensating our executives we do not have a policy requiring compensation to be deductible 

compensation committee report 

the zoetis compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this 2012 annual report based on its review and discussions with management the zoetis compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this 2012 annual report

 the following “2012 pension benefits table” shows the estimated present value of accumulated benefits payable to each of our neos under the pfizer consolidated pension plan or the pfizer retirement plan which for 2012 retained the pension formula under the pfizer retirement annuity plan or the prap and the related nonfunded pfizer supplemental retirement plan or the supplemental retirement plan 



  

 the pfizer retirement plan 

the pfizer retirement plan is a funded taxqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain employees including our neos hired prior to january 1 2011 

111   

pfizer retirement plan prap formula and supplemental retirement plan  benefits under the pfizer retirement plan prap formula are based on the employee’s years of service and highest average earnings for a five calendaryear period and are payable after retirement in the form of an annuity or a lump sum 

benefits under the pfizer retirement plan are calculated as an annuity equal to the greater of 

 years of service under these formulas cannot exceed 35 

compensation covered by the pfizer retirement plan and the related supplemental retirement plan for the neos for 2012 equals the sum of the amounts set forth for 2012 in the “salary” and “nonequity incentive plan compensation” columns of the “2012 summary compensation table” covered compensation for mr passov also includes restricted stock awards granted on or prior to april 26 2001 after the payment of the awards for the fiveyear period ended on december 31 2004 no further performancebased share awards are included in the determination of pensions under the pfizer retirement plan or the supplemental retirement plan 

pfizer retirement plan – dr knupp 

prior to january 1 2012 dr knupp earned pension benefits under the warnerlambert formula in the pfizer retirement plan and the related warnerlambert nonqualified supplemental retirement plan as of january 1 2012 dr knupp began earning pension benefits under the prap formula and ceased earning additional accruals under the warnerlambert formula dr knupp’s total retirement benefit will reflect the warnerlambert formula for service prior to 2012 and the prap formula for service after 2011 

benefits under the warnerlambert formula are based on the employee’s years of service and pensionable earnings and are payable after retirement in the form of an annuity 

benefits under the warner lambert formula are calculated based on the following 

 general  contributions to the pfizer retirement plan are made entirely by pfizer and are paid into a trust fund from which benefits are paid 

the amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits under the pfizer retirement plan is limited by the code for 2012 the annual limitation was 250000 the code also limits the amount of pension that can be paid under the pfizer retirement plan to a 2012 annual maximum of 200000 payable at age 65 in accordance with the code requirements under the supplemental retirement plan pfizer provides out of its general assets amounts substantially equal to the difference between the amount that may be paid under the pfizer retirement plan and the amount that would be paid in the absence of these code limits the supplemental retirement plan is nonfunded 

the present value of accumulated benefits has been computed based on the assumptions as of december 31 2012 in the following table which were used in developing pfizer’s financial statement disclosures 



  

 early retirement provisions  under the pfizer retirement plan and supplemental retirement plan the normal retirement age is 65 under the pfizer retirement plan prap formula if a participant terminates employment with an age and years of service combination equal to or 

112   

greater than 90 the employee is entitled to receive either an annuity or a lump sum that is unreduced under the terms of the pfizer retirement plan or the supplemental retirement plan for early payment if an employee retires on or after age 55 with 10 or more years of service that participant may elect to receive either an early retirement annuity payment reduced by 4 per year prorated for partial years for each year between benefit commencement and age 65 or such amount in a lump sum payment if an employee does not satisfy any of the above criteria and has three years of vesting service under the retirement plan that participant may elect to receive an annuity starting on or after age 55 which is reduced by 6 per year for each year prorated for partial years prior to age 65 a lump sum payment is not available 

for dr knupp under the warnerlambert formula the normal retirement age is 65 if she terminates employment after age 55 with 5 or more years of service she may elect to receive an early retirement annuity payment where the benefit earningrelated credits accrued will be reduced by 3 per year from age 60 to 62 or 6 for each year from age 55 to age 60 there is no reduction if payments start at or after age 62 

the following “2012 nonqualified deferred compensation table” summarizes activity during 2012 and account balances in the various pfizer nonqualified savings and deferral plans for our neos as of december 31 2012 except as otherwise provided below the following plans and programs permit the executives to defer amounts previously earned on a pretax basis pfizer’s nonfunded deferred compensation and supplemental savings plan or the pssp pfizer’s deferred compensation plan for gpp psas and sti shift awards rsus are also subject to mandatory deferral if the executive is subject to or is likely to be subject to section 162m of the code the pssp is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan that provides for the deferral of compensation that otherwise could have been deferred under the related taxqualified 401k plans but for the application of certain code limitations and for company matching contributions based on the executive’s contributions other than the matching contributions and the earnings thereon in the pssp the account balances in these plans are generally attributable to deferrals of previously earned compensation and the earnings on those amounts 



 pfizer savings plans 

pfizer provides the pfizer savings plan or the savings plan to usbased employees of pfizer and the pssp to employees who meet the eligibility requirements including our neos contribution amounts are reflected in the “2012 summary compensation table” earnings have not been included these plans are described below 

the savings plan is a taxqualified retirement savings plan participating employees may contribute up to 20 of “regular earnings” on a beforetax basis roth 401k basis and aftertax basis into their savings plan accounts “regular earnings” for the savings plan include both salary and bonus or annual incentive awards in addition under the savings plan pfizer generally matches an amount equal to one dollar for 

113   

each dollar contributed by participating employees on the first 3 of their regular earnings and fifty cents for each additional dollar contributed on the next 3 of their regular earnings matching contributions generally are invested in pfizer common stock plan participants have the ability to immediately diversify the matching contribution investments 

pursuant to tax law limitations effective for 2012 the pfizer savings plan limits the “additions” that can be made to a participating employee’s account to 49000 per year “additions” include pfizer matching contributions beforetax contributions roth 401k contributions and aftertax contributions 

the code limits the amounts that may be allocated to taxqualified savings plans and the amount of compensation that can be taken into account in computing benefits under the savings plan the 2012 maximum beforetax and roth 401k contribution limit was 17000 per year or 22000 per year for eligible participants age 50 and over in addition no more than 250000 of annual compensation may be taken into account in computing benefits under the savings plan 

the pssp is intended to pay out of the general assets of pfizer an amount substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been allocated to an employee’s account as beforetax contributions pfizer matching contributions and the amount actually allocated under the savings plan in the absence of the limits described in the preceding paragraph under the pssp participants can elect to defer up to 20 of eligible wages on a beforetax basis generally under the pssp participants can elect to receive payments as a lump sum or in one to twenty annual installments following termination from service participants who do not make an election receive lump sum payments in certain circumstances pfizer has established and funded trusts to secure its obligations to make payments under the pssp 

amounts deferred if any under the pssp by the neos for 2012 are included in the “salary” and “nonequity incentive plan compensation” columns of the “2012 summary compensation table” in the “2012 nonqualified deferred compensation table” pssp values are shown for each neo executive contributions reflect the percent of salary and bonus the executive has elected to defer under the pssp the pfizer matching contributions are shown in the “company contributions” column of the table for the neos pfizer’s matching contributions under the savings plan and the pssp are shown in the “all other compensation” column of the “2012 summary compensation table” the “aggregate earnings” column in the table above represents the amount by which the pssp balance changed in the past fiscal year net of employee and employer contributions
