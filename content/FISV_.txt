 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks 

develop into actual events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

competitive and business risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have adverse impacts on our business and may amplify many of our other known risks 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have taken actions to prevent the spread of covid19 such as imposing travel restrictions and bans quarantines social distancing guidelines shelterinplace or lockdown orders and other similar limitations these measures have among other matters negatively impacted consumer and business spending and as a result our operating performance primarily within our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses which earn transactionbased fees the pandemic has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact transaction volumes create economic uncertainty and financial market volatility reduce economic activity increase unemployment and cause a decline in consumer and business confidence and could in the future further negatively impact the demand for our products and services including merchant acquiring and payment processing ultimately the extent of the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition will depend on among other matters the duration and intensity of the pandemic the level of success of global vaccination efforts governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us and the impact of the pandemic on our employees clients vendors supply chain operations and sales all of which are uncertain difficult to predict and may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides including due to a continued or prolonged recession in the us or other major economies 

additional factors that could negatively impact us include 

• sustained increases in consumer chargebacks associated with processed transactions that merchant clients have submitted but have not fulfilled as an unprecedented number of merchants have been required to suspend or terminate their operations merchants may be unable to fund these chargebacks potentially resulting in losses to us 

• disruption to our supply chain and thirdparty delivery service providers including if the factories that manufacture our pointofsale devices payment cards or computer chips for payment cards or paper stock are temporarily closed or experience workforce shortages shipping services are interrupted or delayed there are increased lead times shortages or higher costs for certain materials and components or there are workforce shortages at our or thirdparty customer support software development or technology hosting facilities 

• government orders or other restrictions that limit or prohibit us from providing clientfacing services from regular service locations the failure of our business continuity plans or supply chain issues that prevent us from meeting client service levels any of which may increase the risk of failing to meet client contractual obligations that could cause loss of revenue contractual penalties or potential legal disputes 

• clients may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts if clients cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection we may experience lower revenue and earnings and have greater exposure to future transaction declines and 

• the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data call production or operations centers affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our clients or other third parties on which we depend 

the covid19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting travel limiting nonessential visitors to our facilities disinfecting facilities providing onsite testing and personal protective equipment to employees establishing a variety of safety protocols at facilities and requiring us employees to be fully vaccinated unless they have an approved medical religious or state exemption we expect to continue such safety measures for the foreseeable future and may take further actions or adapt these existing policies as government authorities may require or recommend or as we may determine to be in the best interest of our employees clients and vendors such measures may impact our productivity or effectiveness and there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the covid19 pandemic 

these and other potential negative impacts relating to the covid19 pandemic may also heighten or exacerbate the other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our principal competitors include other vendors and providers of financial services technology and payment systems data processing affiliates of large companies processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives financial institutions independent sales organizations “isos” independent software vendors payments companies and payment network operators our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we may compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new technologies and wellfunded competitors including large technology telecommunication media and other companies not historically in the financial services and payments industries startups and international providers of products and services similar to ours in addition participants in the financial services payments and technology industries may merge create joint ventures or engage in other business combinations alliances and consolidations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to keep pace with technological change we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and increasing client expectations our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance we must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain competitive within our relevant markets for example our ability to provide innovative pointofsale technology to our merchant clients could have an impact on our merchant acquiring business and new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industrywide solutions and standards related to tokenization or other safety fraud prevention and security technologies if we are unable to anticipate or respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely basis our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected in addition the success of certain of our products and services rely in part on financial institutions corporate and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance and compete effectively or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services or to perform the services inhouse some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices features or other services that we do not offer and some clients may desire to perform the services themselves larger clients may be able to seek lower prices from us when they renew or extend a contract or the client’s business has significant volume changes in addition larger clients may reduce the services we provide if they decide to move services inhouse further our small merchant business clients may seek reduced fees due to pricing competition their own financial condition or pressures from their customers on some occasions these factors result in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our merchant relationships and alliances and if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances our business may be adversely affected 

under our alliance program a bank or other institution forms an alliance with us generally on an exclusive basis either contractually or through a separate legal entity merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us andor the bank or institution the banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant we provide transaction processing and related functions to the alliance both we and our alliance partners may also provide management sales marketing and other administrative services the alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions any one of which may be selected by the merchant as its bank partner our merchant acquiring business depends in part on our merchant relationships alliances and other distribution channels there can be no guarantee 

that we will achieve growth in our merchant relationships alliances or other distribution channels in addition our contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are for fixed terms and may allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all the loss of merchant relationships or alliance partners could negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks including the card networks which we own and operate increase the processing and other fees including what is commonly called “interchange fees” that they charge it is possible that competitive and other pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future or not being able to increase our own fees which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin limit our growth and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

mergers consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services our alliance strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations especially where the financial institutions involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have an increased ability to negotiate terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational and security risks 

security incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could expose us to liability or damage our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our employees our clients and their customers under the card network rules various federal state and international laws and client contracts we are responsible for information provided to us by financial institutions merchants isos thirdparty service providers and others preserving the confidentiality of sensitive business and personal information is critical to our business any unauthorized access intrusion infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients partners or vendors these incidents are often difficult to detect and are constantly evolving we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities and those of our clients partners and vendors through various means and with increasing sophistication particularly as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic given increased online banking ecommerce and other online activity these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and that none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place to detect security incidents and protect sensitive data including protection against unauthorized access and use by our employees will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging technological risks and threats the impact of a material event involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures and resulting interruptions in the implementation or availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of our processing and other systems an operational failure and the resulting implementation delays or service interruption could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could involve the hardware software data networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control events that could cause operational failures include but are not limited to hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice 

and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters pandemics power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events in the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program implementation delays interruptions of service or hardware device defects could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits product recalls or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue and significantly impact our clients’ businesses and the customers they serve in addition a significant implementation delay interruption of service or product recall could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider as a provider of payments solutions and other financial services clients regulators and others may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans including frequent testing of such plans meeting these various requirements may require a significant investment of time and money any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services 

the operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected many of the transactions involving our products and services rely on multiple participants in the global financial system to move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain a disruption for any reason of the operations of a participant in the global financial system could impact our ability to obtain or provide information or cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our products and services although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective such a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services reputational damage lost clients and revenue loss of clients’ and their customers’ confidence as well as additional costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on third parties to provide products and services and if we are unable to obtain such products or services in the future or if these third parties fail to perform these services adequately  our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on third parties we do not control to provide us with products and services including payment card networks acquiring processors payment card issuers financial institutions and the automated clearing house “ach” network which transmit transaction data process chargebacks and refunds and perform clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if for example such third parties stop providing clearing services or limit our volumes we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services in the event these third parties fail to provide these services adequately or in a timely manner including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all and we are not able to find timely suitable alternatives we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers which could expose us and our clients to information security financial compliance and reputational risks among others and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition if we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors and service providers we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost which would negatively impact our results of operations 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients or client data negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

global market risks 

our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with operations outside of the us and as we continue to expand internationally we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks 

we offer merchant acquiring processing and issuing services outside of the us including in the uk germany argentina india and brazil our facilities outside of the us and those of our suppliers and vendors including manufacturing customer support software development and technology hosting facilities are subject to risks including natural disasters public health crises political crises terrorism war political instability and other events outside of our or our suppliers’ control as we continue to expand internationally and grow our client base outside of the us we may face challenges due to the presence of more established competitors and our relative lack of experience in such nonus markets and we may incur higher than anticipated costs if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with the international operation and expansion of our business our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive revenue primarily from products and services we provide to the financial services industry and from our merchant acquiring business given this focus we are exposed to global economic conditions and adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such trends may include but are not limited to the following 

• declining economies foreign currency fluctuations inflation social unrest natural disasters public health crises including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors such as crossborder travel patterns on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent 

• low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high inflation andor unemployment may cause decreased spending by cardholders 

• budgetary concerns in the us and other countries around the world could affect the us and other specific sovereign credit ratings impact consumer confidence and spending and increase the risks of operating in those countries 

• emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the us and europe and adverse economic trends including high rates of inflation may be more pronounced in such emerging markets 

• financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults 

• uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients’ businesses may make estimates of our revenues rebates incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable 

• our clients may decrease spending for valueadded services and 

• government intervention including the effect of laws regulations treaties andor government investments in our clients may have potential negative effects on our business operations and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products 

a weakening in the economy or competition from other retailers could also force some retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices 

a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process or accounts we service which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in europe we are continuing to assess the implications of the united kingdom leaving the european union “brexit” we cannot predict the impact that brexit including any future trade agreements divergence in law or currency fluctuations will have on our business and our clients and it is possible that it may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

potential tariffs or trade wars could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results 

the us has imposed tariffs on certain imports from china including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in china if the us administration imposes additional tariffs or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the us or other countries our hardware devices produced in china could be impacted although it is difficult to predict how current or future tariffs on items imported from china or elsewhere will impact our business the cost of our products manufactured in china and imported into the us or other countries could increase which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

regulatory and compliance risks 

if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed 

if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business including state and federal payment cybersecurity consumer protection trade and data privacy laws and regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and our ability to obtain new clients could be inhibited which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our clients are also subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks financial institutions and card issuers in the us and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by these federal state local and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change with new laws regulations and interpretations thereof being implemented 

in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state local and foreign governments issued emergency orders and a significant number of new laws and regulations in a short period of time these actions have impacted our current operations including with respect to collection and consumer credit reporting activities and we have experienced an increased volume of client support requests because many of the new laws impact our clients we have been required to expend additional resources and incur additional costs to address regulatory requirements applicable to us or our clients and there could be additional government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs or fees to merchants or fees or other sources of revenue to financial institutions all of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters and are required among other matters to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports our directtoconsumer payments businesses are subject to state and federal regulations in the us including state money transmission regulations antimoney laundering regulations economic and trade sanctions administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign asset control “ofac” and certain privacy regulations such as the us grammleachbliley act our money network financial llc subsidiary provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the financial crimes enforcement network we also have businesses that are subject to credit reporting and debt collection laws and regulations in the us in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to among others privacy antimoney laundering debt collection and payment institution or electronic money licensing regulations outside the us 

we operate our business around the world including in certain foreign countries with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws applicable to us including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these laws prohibit among other things improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies and training programs to discourage such practices however there can be no assurance that all of our employees consultants and agents will comply with our policies and all applicable laws 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs including those that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

the volume and complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business failure to comply with these laws and regulations or changes in the regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal state local or foreign governments may 

result in significant financial penalties reputational harm suspension or termination of our ability to provide certain services or change or restrict the manner in which we currently conduct our business all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks and nacha they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our transaction processing services several of our subsidiaries are registered with visa and mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions a number of our subsidiaries outside the us are direct members or associate members of visa and mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring and various subsidiaries are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks as such we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us acquiring clients processing clients or merchants in addition we are subject to nacha rules relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ach network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions as well as the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of nacha and the card networks are set by their respective boards some of which are our competitors and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services 

if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated the suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications or any changes to the association and network rules that we do not successfully address or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the us have been adopted including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changes to the doddfrank act or regulations could adversely impact our debit network business in addition certain of our alliance partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

to the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions additional regulation examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations or limit our ability to update our existing products and services or require us to develop new ones any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention in europe the general data protection regulation “gdpr” extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location subject to certain limitations the law requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data eu data protection law continuously develops and requires significant changes to our policies and procedures for example in 2020 the court of justice of the european union issued a decision that invalidated the european commission’s adequacy decision for the euus privacy shield framework and placed additional safeguards necessary for transfers of personal data to the us requiring companies and regulators to conduct casebycase analyses to determine whether foreign protections concerning government access to transferred data meet eu standards together with our vendors and clients we have been directly impacted by this decision and our ability to transfer data outside the eu may be further impacted by determinations made by regulators in the eu we are also subject to uk gdpr 

following the uk’s exit from the eu single market and customs union our efforts to comply with eu uk and other privacy and data protection laws around the world that apply to our businesses could involve substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and limit the services we are able to offer there is also increased focus on data localization requirements around the world in countries such as the united arab emirates china and india which could impact our business model with respect to our storage and transfer of personal data further failure to comply with applicable laws in this area could also result in significant fines penalties and reputational damage 

in addition us banking agencies have adopted or proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our financial institution clients and that would address cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states also have adopted or proposed new privacy and cybersecurity laws targeting these issues legislation and regulations on cybersecurity data privacy and data localization may compel us to enhance or modify our systems invest in new systems or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy if any of these outcomes were to occur our operational costs could increase significantly 

failure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect our business 

through our merchant alliances we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses in order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program notwithstanding our compliance program it is possible that perceived or actual violations of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions regulatory scrutiny of or regulatory enforcement action in connection with compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we expose ourselves to additional liability when we agree to defend or indemnify our clients against thirdparty infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy it is also possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology further we use open source software in connection with our solutions companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of solutions developed using open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available the laws of certain nonus countries where we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the us misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our operations are subject to tax by federal state local and international taxing jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations in our significant tax jurisdictions could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations additionally future tax laws regulations or guidance from the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards 

board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

the us congress the organization for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we do business remain focused on the taxation of multinational corporations the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries including the us is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles including ensuring all companies pay a global minimum tax and expanding taxing rights of market countries because the timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating countries significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of these initiatives and their implementation could adversely affect our business or financial results 

furthermore our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations we have established contingency reserves for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there is no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

organizational and financial risks 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our merchants may be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable 

we are subject to the risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable for example we and our merchant acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants if we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant because of the merchant’s insolvency or other reasons we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder although we have an active program to manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent transactions including electronic payment and card transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud we also rely on isos to sell our merchant processing services which they may do by contracting with their own subisos we rely on these isos and subisos to exercise appropriate controls to avoid fraudulent transactions it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback 

responsibilities would increase our chargeback liability or expose us to fines or other liabilities increases in chargebacks fines or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult or expensive to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

in addition acquisitions outside of the us often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights in some nonus countries 

• difficulty entering new nonus markets due to among other things consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets and 

• general economic and political conditions 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 66 of our total assets at december 31 2021 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

existing or future leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2021 we had approximately 212 billion of debt we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to 

support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if certain of our outstanding senior notes or commercial paper notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements including due to a lack of further recovery or deterioration in economic and market conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 

an increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan foreign lines of credit commercial paper and receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense at december 31 2021 we had approximately 29 billion in variable rate debt which includes 200 million on our term loan 337 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and foreign lines of credit an aggregate amount of 18 billion outstanding under our us dollar and euro commercial paper programs and 500 million drawn on our accounts receivable securitization facility based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2021 a 1 increase in variable interest rates would result in an increase to annual interest expense of 29 million 

our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by such international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedging instruments to mitigate the market value risks associated with foreign currencydenominated transactions and investments these hedging strategies may not however eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation and we may forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if currency exchange rates were to change in our favor we have also issued foreign currencydenominated senior notes and commercial paper notes for which payments of interest and principal are to be made in foreign currency and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could cause the expense associated with such payments to increase in addition we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into us dollars any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

new omaha holdings lp may sell a substantial amount of our common stock as certain restrictions on sales expire and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

new omaha holdings lp “new omaha” owns approximately 75 of our outstanding shares new omaha may sell its shares subject to certain limitations contained in the shareholder agreement between us and new omaha under a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition we have granted new omaha registration rights which permit among others underwritten offerings the registration rights agreement will terminate when the aggregate ownership percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock held by new omaha and its affiliate transferees falls below 2 and such shares may be freely sold without restrictions

enterprise priorities 

we aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world by delivering superior value for our clients through leading technology targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do we achieve this through active portfolio management of our business enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our longterm priorities are to i continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions iii deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients and iv deliver integration value from acquisitions 

industry trends 

the global payments landscape continues to evolve with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments ecommerce and innovation in realtime payments infrastructure because of this growth competition also continues to evolve business and consumer expectations continue to rise with a focus on convenience and security to meet these expectations payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience 

merchants 

the rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and ecommerce driven by consumers’ desire for convenient and efficient shopping experiences has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in highgrowth online and mobile settings which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments merchants are demanding simple integrated and modern pos systems to help manage their everyday business operations when combined with the everincreasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services merchants have sought modern pos systems to streamline this complexity furthermore merchants can now search discover compare purchase and even install a new pos system through direct digitalonly experiences this direct digitalonly channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities especially with respect to smaller merchants 

in addition there are numerous softwareasaservice “saas” solutions in the industry many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships saas solutions that integrate payments are often referred to as isvs and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us 

we believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes from small and midsized businesses or “smbs” to mediumsized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants and across all verticals furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of small medium and large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions gives us a solid foundation for growth 

financial institutions 

financial service providers regularly introduce and implement new payment deposit risk management lending and investment products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” which enable financial institutions to offer their customers an industryleading digital banking experience 

the focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including a unified seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us 

in addition to the trends described above during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated these fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth 

recent market conditions 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by the coronavirus “covid19” pandemic the covid19 pandemic and various measures imposed by the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions to prevent its spread have among other matters negatively impacted consumer and business spending and as a result our operating performance primarily within our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses which earn transactionbased fees 

we experienced a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions beginning in late march 2020 that negatively impacted our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses as well as modest declines in other businesses merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes began to partially recover throughout the remainder of 2020 and have continued to grow throughout 2021 accordingly our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses were less impacted by the covid19 pandemic during 2021 than they were throughout most of fiscal 2020 while this current business trend is positive the extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition will depend on among other matters the duration and intensity of the pandemic the level of success of global vaccination efforts governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us and the impact of the pandemic on our employees clients vendors supply chain operations and sales all of which are uncertain difficult to predict and may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides including due to a continued or prolonged recession in the us or other major economies 

in 2021 we began observing increasing shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses such as semiconductors paper and plastic and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices 

the covid19 pandemic has also caused us to modify our business practices including restricting travel limiting nonessential visitors to our facilities disinfecting facilities providing onsite testing and personal protective equipment to employees establishing a variety of safety protocols at facilities and requiring us employees to be fully vaccinated unless they have an approved medical religious or state exemption 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates growth and retention rates royalty rates expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level which is one level below our 

reportable segments when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test 

the quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2021 determined that our goodwill of 364 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values however for three of our reporting units that were acquired as part of the first data acquisition with aggregate goodwill of 111 billion the excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair value over carrying value ranged from 8 to 21 percent if future operating performance is below our expectations or there are changes to forecasted revenue growth rates riskadjusted discount rates effective income tax rates merchant alliance agreements or some combination thereof a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in and we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge it is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment or the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on certain of our recently acquired recorded at fair value first data businesses such as an increased duration and intensity of the pandemic andor governmentimposed restrictions could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment we have no accumulated goodwill impairment through december 31 2021 additional information regarding our goodwill is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable we review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset depending on the type of asset determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties as a practical expedient we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less contracts with customers are evaluated on a contractbycontract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below 

processing and services 

processing and services revenue is generated from account and transactionbased fees for data processing merchant transaction processing and acquiring electronic billing and payment services electronic funds transfer and debitcredit processing services consulting and professional services and software maintenance for ongoing client support 

we recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which case revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and ifneeded basis a standready obligation and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining tierbased price per unit based on volume of service however pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis 

product 

product revenue is generated from print and card production sales as well as software license and hardware pos devices sales for software license agreements that are distinct we recognize software license revenue upon delivery assuming a contract is deemed to exist revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended such as labor hours to measure progress towards completion for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software we sell or lease hardware pos devices and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers hardware typically consists of terminals or clover devices we do not manufacture hardware rather we purchase hardware from thirdparty vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer we account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware 

significant judgments 

we use the following methods inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize for multielement arrangements we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer if these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer 

the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained we include an estimate of the variable amount as appropriate within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted the transaction price including any discounts or rebates is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multielement arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service 

contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or when a customer terminates some or all of the existing services provided by us when a contract modification occurs it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as i a separate contract ii the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract or iii a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract further contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation 

additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws sometimes made more complex by our global footprint judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item in establishing a liability for known tax exposures assumptions are made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position will be sustained a tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date the amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we 

believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate 

we maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when based upon the weight of all available evidence we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies however there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment to the extent our judgment changes the valuation allowances are then adjusted generally through the provision for income taxes in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs additional information regarding our income taxes is included in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to i fund normal operating expenses ii meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness including finance leases and iii fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short term and the long term using cash flow generated by our operations along with our cash and cash equivalents of 835 million proceeds from the issuance of us and euro commercial paper notes and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of 16 billion net of outstanding balance and 18 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper notes programs at december 31 2021 the following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively  our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 40 billion in 2021 a decrease of 3 compared with 41 billion in 2020 this decrease was primarily attributable to higher working capital use compared to the prior year including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth and higher income tax payments following consumption of certain federal net operating loss carryforwards partially offset by improved operating results

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2021 we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities as of december 31 2021 we had a commercial paper credit rating of p2 from moody’s and a2 from sp 

the interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes our term loan commercial paper notes programs and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents 

investments exclusive of settlement assets with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2021 and 2020 we held 835 million and 906 million in cash and cash equivalents respectively 

the table below details the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 

1 represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors for such entities declares a dividend as well as cash held by certain other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements 

employee termination costs 

in connection with the acquisition of first data we implemented integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure including eliminating duplicate costs we recorded 95 million and 131 million of employee termination costs related to severance and other separation costs for terminated employees including those in connection with the acquisition of first data during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively accrued employee severance and other separation costs of 36 million at december 31 2021 are expected to be paid within the next twelve months 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty as to general global economic and market conditions we believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business however as the impact of the pandemic on the economy and our operations further evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity needs the ability to continue to service debt and meet lease and other obligations as they come due depends on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows a lack of continued recovery or further deterioration in economic and market conditions could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity particularly our cash flows from operations 

we engage in regular communication with the banks that participate in our revolving credit facility during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote we maintain us and euro commercial paper notes programs to access funding for general corporate purposes at favorable rates and to provide a source of liquidity as of december 31 2021 we had a commercial paper credit rating of p2 from moody’s and a2 from sp any downgrade to our commercial paper credit ratings or instability in the commercial paper markets may adversely impact our ability to access funding through our commercial paper notes programs and require us to rely more heavily on more expensive financing arrangements including our revolving credit facility in addition the longterm debt markets have historically provided us with a source of liquidity 

although we do not currently anticipate an inability to obtain financing from longterm debt markets in the future effects of the covid19 pandemic could make financing more difficult andor expensive to obtain our ability to access the longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms also depends on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of december 31 2021 we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s and bbb with a stable outlook from sp in the event that the ratings of our outstanding longterm debt securities were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets could be adversely affected and our interest expense could increase under the terms of certain of our longterm debt securities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed to certain market risks primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our senior management actively monitors these risks 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash provided by operating activities we use a combination of fixed and variablerate debt instruments to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations we had fixed and variablerate debt excluding finance leases and other financing obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 177 billion and 29 billion respectively at december 31 2021 our fixedrate debt at december 31 2021 primarily consisted of fixedrate senior notes with a fair value of 189 billion based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities the potential change in fair value of our fixedrate senior notes from a hypothetical 1 change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate debt instruments before their maturity our variablerate debt at december 31 2021 primarily consisted of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility us dollar and euro commercial paper variable rate term loan foreign lines of credit and debt associated with the receivables securitization agreement based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2021 a hypothetical 1 increase in market interest rates related to our variablerate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately 29 million this sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at december 31 2021 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions we receive settlement funds that are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interestrelated income that we earn on these investments during the year ended december 31 2021 the amount of such interestrelated income was not material and therefore a hypothetical 1 decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on such income this sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at december 31 2021 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollardenominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and nonderivative net investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency approximately 14 and 13 of our total revenue was generated outside the us in 2021 and 2020 respectively the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the argentine peso brazilian real british pound canadian dollar euro and indian rupee a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10 would have resulted in a decrease or increase respectively in our reported pretax income as follows at december 31  we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in india at december 31 2021 the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 341 million with a positive fair value of 6 million in addition we designated our foreign currencydenominated senior notes and euro commercial paper notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

competitive and business risks 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our principal competitors include other vendors and providers of financial services technology and payment systems data processing affiliates of large companies processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives financial institutions independent sales organizations “isos” independent software vendors payments companies and payment network operators our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we may compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new technologies and wellfunded competitors including large technology telecommunication media and other companies not historically in the financial services and payments industries startups and international providers of products and services similar to ours in addition participants in the financial services payments and technology industries may merge create joint ventures or engage in other business combinations alliances and consolidations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to keep pace with technological change we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and increasing client expectations our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance we must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain competitive within our relevant markets for example our ability to provide innovative pointofsale technology to our merchant clients could have an impact on our merchant acquiring business and new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industrywide solutions and standards related to tokenization or other safety fraud prevention and security technologies if we are unable to anticipate or respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely basis our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected in addition the success of certain of our products and services rely in part on financial institutions corporate and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance and compete effectively or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services or to perform the services inhouse some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices features or other services that we do not offer and some clients may desire to perform the services themselves larger clients may be able to seek lower prices from us when they renew or extend a contract or the client’s business has significant volume changes in addition larger clients may reduce the services we provide if they decide to move services inhouse further our small merchant business clients may seek reduced fees due to pricing competition their own financial condition or pressures from their customers on some occasions these factors result in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our merchant relationships and alliances and if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances our business may be adversely affected 

under our alliance program a bank or other institution forms an alliance with us generally on an exclusive basis either contractually or through a separate legal entity merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us andor the bank or institution the banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant we provide transaction processing and related functions to the alliance both we and our alliance partners may also provide management sales marketing and other administrative services the alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions any one of which may be selected by the merchant as its bank partner our merchant acquiring business depends in part on our merchant relationships alliances and other distribution channels there can be no guarantee that we will achieve growth in our merchant relationships alliances or other distribution channels in addition our contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are for fixed terms and may allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all the loss of merchant relationships or alliance partners could negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks including the card networks which we own and operate increase the processing and other fees including what is commonly called “interchange fees” that they charge it is possible that competitive and other pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future or not being able to increase our own fees which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin limit our growth and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

mergers consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services our alliance strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations especially where the financial institutions involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have an increased ability to negotiate terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational and security risks 

security incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could expose us to liability or damage our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our employees our clients and their customers under the card network rules various federal state and international laws and client contracts we are responsible for information provided to us by financial institutions merchants isos thirdparty service providers and others the confidentiality of such sensitive business information and personal consumer information residing on 

our systems is critical to our business any unauthorized access intrusion infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients partners or vendors these incidents are often difficult to detect and are constantly evolving we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities and those of our clients partners and vendors through various means and with increasing sophistication these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and that none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place to detect security incidents and protect sensitive data including protection against unauthorized access and use by our employees will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging technological risks and threats the impact of a material event involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures and resulting interruptions in the implementation or availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of our processing and other systems an operational failure and the resulting implementation delays or service interruption could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could involve the hardware software data networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control events that could cause operational failures include but are not limited to hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters pandemics power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events in the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program implementation delays interruptions of service or hardware device defects could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits product recalls or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue and significantly impact our clients’ businesses and the customers they serve in addition a significant implementation delay interruption of service or product recall could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider as a provider of payments solutions and other financial services clients regulators and others may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans including frequent testing of such plans meeting these various requirements may require a significant investment of time and money any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services 

the operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected many of the transactions involving our products and services rely on multiple participants in the global financial system to move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain a disruption for any reason of the operations of a participant in the global financial system could impact our ability to obtain or provide information or cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our products and services although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective such a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services reputational damage lost clients and revenue loss of clients’ and their customers’ confidence as well as additional costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on third parties to provide products and services and if we are unable to obtain such products or services in the future or if these third parties fail to perform these services adequately  our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on third parties we do not control to provide us with products and services including payment card networks acquiring processors payment card issuers financial institutions and the automated clearing house “ach” network which transmit transaction data process chargebacks and refunds and perform clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if for example such third parties stop providing clearing services or limit our volumes we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services in the event these third parties fail to provide these services adequately or in a timely manner including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control or refuse to provide these services on 

terms acceptable to us or at all and we are not able to find timely suitable alternatives we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers which could expose us and our clients to information security financial compliance and reputational risks among others and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition if we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors and service providers we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost which would negatively impact our results of operations 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients or client data negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

covid19 pandemic risks 

our business has been and is likely to continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have taken actions to prevent the spread of covid19 such as imposing travel restrictions and bans quarantines social distancing guidelines shelterinplace or lockdown orders and other similar limitations these measures have among other matters negatively impacted consumer and business spending and as a result our operating performance primarily within our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses which earn transactionbased fees the pandemic may continue to negatively impact transaction volumes create economic uncertainty and financial market volatility reduce economic activity increase unemployment and cause a decline in consumer and business confidence and could in the future further negatively impact the demand for our products and services including merchant acquiring and payment processing ultimately the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on among other matters the duration and intensity of the pandemic the level of success of global vaccination efforts governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us and the impact of the pandemic on our employees clients vendors operations and sales all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

additional factors that could negatively impact us include 

• payment processing risks associated with disruptions to merchant activity and business failures including chargeback risk as an unprecedented number of merchants have been required to suspend or terminate their operations there may be an increase in consumer chargebacks associated with processed transactions that merchant clients have submitted but have not fulfilled merchants may be unable to fund these chargebacks potentially resulting in losses to us 

• client payment risks clients may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts if clients cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection we may experience lower revenue and earnings and have greater exposure to future transaction declines 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking ecommerce and other online activity 

• disruption to our supply chain and thirdparty delivery service providers including if the factories that manufacture our pointofsale devices are temporarily closed or experience workforce shortages if shipping services are interrupted or delayed or if there are workforce shortages at our or thirdparty customer support software development or technology hosting facilities 

• increased risk of failing to meet client contractual obligations including due to government orders or other restrictions that limit or prohibit us from providing clientfacing services from regular service locations or the failure of our business continuity plans which could cause loss of revenue contractual penalties or potential legal disputes and associated costs and 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data call or operations centers 

affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our clients or other third parties on which we depend 

the covid19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices including requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely suspending nonessential travel suspending all nonessential visitors to our facilities disinfecting facilities and workspaces extensively and frequently providing personal protective equipment to associates and requiring employees who must be present at our facilities to adhere to a variety of safety protocols we expect to continue such safety measures for the foreseeable future and may take further actions or adapt these existing policies as government authorities may require or recommend or as we may determine to be in the best interest of our employees clients and vendors such measures may impact our productivity or effectiveness and there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the covid19 pandemic including the risks to the health of our employees further the ability of our employees to get to work has been disrupted across multiple locations both with respect to their own offices and client sites due among other things to government work and travel restrictions including mandatory shutdowns 

in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state local and foreign governments have issued emergency orders and a significant number of new laws and regulations in a short period of time these actions have impacted our current operations including with respect to collection and consumer credit reporting activities and we have experienced an increased volume of client support requests because many of the new laws impact our clients we could be required to expend additional resources and incur additional costs to address regulatory requirements applicable to us or our clients and we may not have the capacity to implement necessary changes within the times prescribed by applicable laws there could be government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs or fees to merchants or fees or other sources of revenue to financial institutions regulations may be unclear difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations as a result we may have to make judgments about how to comply with these new laws and regulators may not ultimately agree with how we implement applicable regulations failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal state local or foreign governments may result in financial penalties lawsuits reputational harm or change the manner in which we or our clients currently conduct some aspects of our business in addition during times of economic stress there tends to be greater regulatory and governmental scrutiny of actions taken in response to such stress and an increased risk of both governmental and thirdparty litigation 

a lack of further recovery or deterioration in economic and market conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to generate earnings and cash flows sufficient to service debt and meet lease and other obligations as they come due or to meet our financial debt covenants the pandemic could also make obtaining financing more difficult or expensive and our ability to access the longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend on market conditions and the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the impacts the covid19 pandemic may continue to have and as a result the ultimate impacts are highly uncertain and subject to change the extent to which the pandemic or any resulting worsening of the global business and economic environment adversely impacts our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and intensity of the covid19 pandemic the actions taken to contain or limit the pandemic including whether vaccination efforts are successful and how quickly and to what extent prepandemic economic and operating conditions can resume these factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides including due to a continued or prolonged recession in the us or other major economies the impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition and heighten or exacerbate risks described in this annual report on form 10k 

global market risks 

our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with operations outside of the us and as we continue to expand internationally we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks 

we offer merchant acquiring processing and issuing services outside of the us including in the uk germany argentina india and brazil our facilities outside of the us and those of our suppliers and vendors including manufacturing customer support software development and technology hosting facilities are subject to risks including natural disasters public health crises political crises terrorism war political instability and other events outside of our or our suppliers’ control as we expand internationally and grow our client base outside of the us we may face challenges due to the presence of more established competitors and our lack of experience in such nonus markets and we may incur higher than anticipated costs if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with the international operation and expansion of our business our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union single market and customs union as part of the process known as “brexit” could adversely affect our results of operations 

effective december 31 2020 the uk left the eu single market and customs union and also ceased to be subject to international agreements the eu is a party to on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed to the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the terms of their future relationship the “trade agreement” as a result and subject to the terms of the trade agreement the rules of the eu single market and customs union relating to the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the uk and the eu ended and the eu and the uk formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces brexit may among other outcomes and subject to the terms of the trade agreement disrupt the free movement of goods services data and people between the uk and the eu undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the eu in addition brexit may lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines going forward and subject to the terms of the trade agreement which eu laws and regulations to maintain and which to amend or replace the effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements in addition to the trade agreement which the eu and the uk reach to allow the us and the eu to retain access to each other’s markets in areas not covered by the trade agreement 

the trade agreement offers uk and eu businesses preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and the eu will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously the trade agreement does not incorporate the full scope of the services sector and businesses such as banking and finance face a more uncertain future the uk and eu plan to put in place a regulatory dialogue on financial services based on a separate memorandum of understanding “mou” talks on the mou are expected to begin by march 2021 at this time we cannot predict the impact that the trade agreement and any future agreements on services including the mou will have on our business and our clients and it is possible that the terms of any new agreements or a failure to reach such agreements may adversely affect our operations and financial results given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have and how such withdrawal will affect us 

in addition brexit may create additional uncertainty in currency exchange rate fluctuations that may result in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business we translate revenue denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international revenue and profit is reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer us dollars any of these effects of brexit among others could materially adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future clients and vendors which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and business opportunities 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive revenue primarily from products and services we provide to the financial services industry and our merchant acquiring business given this focus we are exposed to global economic conditions and adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such trends may include but are not limited to the following 

• declining economies foreign currency fluctuations social unrest natural disasters public health crises including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors such as crossborder travel patterns on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent 

• low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high inflation andor unemployment may cause decreased spending by cardholders 

• budgetary concerns in the us and other countries around the world could affect the us and other specific sovereign credit ratings impact consumer confidence and spending and increase the risks of operating in those countries 

• emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the us and europe and adverse economic trends including high rates of inflation may be more pronounced in such emerging markets 

• financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults 

• uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients’ businesses may make estimates of our revenues rebates incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable 

• our clients may decrease spending for valueadded services and 

• government intervention including the effect of laws regulations andor government investments in our clients may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products 

a weakening in the economy or competition from other retailers could also force some retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices 

a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process or accounts we service which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

potential tariffs or trade wars could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results 

the us has imposed tariffs on certain imports from china including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in china if the us administration imposes additional tariffs or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the us or other countries our hardware devices produced in china could be impacted although it is difficult to predict how current or future tariffs on items imported from china or elsewhere will impact our business the cost of our products manufactured in china and imported into the us or other countries could increase which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

regulatory and compliance risks 

if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed 

if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business including state and federal payment cybersecurity consumer protection trade and data privacy laws and regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and our ability to obtain new clients could be inhibited which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our clients are also subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks financial institutions and card issuers in the us and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by these federal state local and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change with new laws regulations and interpretations thereof being implemented 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters and are required among other matters to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports our directtoconsumer payments businesses are subject to state and federal regulations in the us including state money transmission regulations antimoney laundering regulations economic and trade sanctions administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign asset control “ofac” and certain privacy regulations such as the us grammleachbliley act our money network financial llc subsidiary provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the financial crimes enforcement network we also have businesses that are subject to credit reporting and debt collection laws and regulations in the us in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to among others privacy antimoney laundering debt collection and payment institution or electronic money licensing regulations outside the us 

we operate our business around the world including in certain foreign countries with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws applicable to us including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these laws prohibit among other things improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies and training programs to discourage such practices however there can be no assurance that all of our employees consultants and agents will comply with our policies and all applicable laws 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs including those that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries 

and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

the volume and complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business failure to comply with these laws and regulations or changes in the regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal state local or foreign governments may result in significant financial penalties reputational harm suspension or termination of our ability to provide certain services or change or restrict the manner in which we currently conduct our business all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks and nacha they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our transaction processing services several of our subsidiaries are registered with visa and mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions a number of our subsidiaries outside the us are direct members or associate members of visa and mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring and various subsidiaries are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks as such we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us acquiring clients processing clients or merchants in addition we are subject to nacha rules relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ach network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions as well as the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of nacha and the card networks are set by their respective boards some of which are our competitors and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services 

if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated the suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications or any changes to the association and network rules that we do not successfully address or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the us have been adopted including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us in addition the cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services including many offered by our clients restricts debit card fees paid by merchants to certain issuer banks and allows merchants to offer discounts for different payment methods cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changes to the doddfrank act or regulations could adversely impact our debit network business in addition certain of our alliance partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

to the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions additional regulation examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations or limit our ability to update our existing products and services or require us to develop new ones any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of 

eu residents regardless of the company’s location subject to certain limitations the law requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data eu data protection law continues to develop and require significant changes to our policies and procedures in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union issued a decision in the case data protection commissioner v facebook ireland limited and maximillian schrems the “schrems ii decision” that invalidated the european commission’s adequacy decision for the euus privacy shield framework and placed additional safeguards necessary for transfers of personal data to the us requiring companies and regulators to conduct casebycase analyses to determine whether foreign protections concerning government access to transferred data meet eu standards our vendors and clients have been directly impacted by the schrems ii decision and our ability to transfer data outside the eu may be further impacted by the schrems ii decision and determinations made by regulators in the eu we do not yet know the extent of this impact on our operations we along with our vendors and customers rely on standard contractual clauses “sccs” to transfer data out of the eu if the european commission requires that new sccs be signed to replace the existing sccs we will need to devote resources to entering into the appropriate sccs to continue to engage in transfers of data as applicable in addition with the uk’s exit from the eu single market and customs union on december 31 2020 there is uncertainty surrounding transfers of personal data from the eu to the uk the trade agreement provides that transfers of personal data from the eu to the uk will not be considered transfers of personal data to a third country during a transitional period of up to six months from january 1 2021 if the transition period ends without an appropriate resolution transfers of personal data from the eu to the uk may be impacted 

our efforts to comply with eu uk and other privacy and data protection laws such as the california consumer privacy act the california privacy rights act taking effect in january 2023 the brazilian general data protection law and south africa’s protection of personal information act could involve substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and limit the services we are able to offer further failure to comply with applicable laws in this area could also result in fines penalties and reputational damage 

in addition us banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our financial institution clients and that would address cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues including the new york cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the new york shield act to protect personal and private data new york and washington state have each proposed comprehensive privacy acts to govern the personal data of their residents the us government has also proposed federal privacy legislation legislation and regulations on cybersecurity data privacy and data localization may compel us to enhance or modify our systems invest in new systems or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy if any of these outcomes were to occur our operational costs could increase significantly 

failure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect   our   business 

through our merchant alliances we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses in order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program notwithstanding our compliance program it is possible that perceived or actual violations of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions regulatory scrutiny of or regulatory enforcement action in connection with compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we expose ourselves to additional liability when we agree to defend or indemnify our clients against thirdparty infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use 

information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy it is also possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology further we use open source software in connection with our solutions companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of solutions developed using open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available the laws of certain nonus countries where we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the us misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our operations are subject to tax by federal state local and international taxing jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations in our significant tax jurisdictions could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations for example the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” significantly revised the us corporate income tax code by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorialtype tax system and imposing repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries further analysis of the tax act or future tax laws regulations or guidance from the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow furthermore our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect   our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations we have established contingency reserves for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there is no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

organizational and financial risks 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our merchants may be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable 

we are subject to the risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable for example we and our merchant acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants if we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant because of the merchant’s insolvency or other reasons we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder although we have an active program to manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent transactions including electronic payment and card transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud we also rely on isos to sell our merchant processing services which they may do by contracting with their own subisos we rely on these isos and subisos to exercise appropriate controls to avoid fraudulent transactions it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback responsibilities would increase our chargeback liability or expose us to fines or other liabilities increases in chargebacks fines or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult or expensive to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

in addition acquisitions outside of the us often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights in some nonus countries 

• difficulty entering new nonus markets due to among other things consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets and 

• general economic and political conditions 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 69 of our total assets at december 31 2020 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

existing or future leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 207 billion of debt we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if certain of our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 

an increase   in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan foreign lines of credit and receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense at december 31 2020 we had approximately 18 billion in variable rate debt which includes 13 billion on our term loan 166 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and lines of credit and 425 million drawn on our accounts receivable securitization facility based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2020 a 1 increase in variable interest rates would result in a decrease to annual pretax income of 18 million 

our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by such international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedging instruments to mitigate the market value risks associated with foreign currencydenominated transactions and investments these hedging strategies may not however eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation and we may forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if currency exchange rates were to change in our favor we have also issued foreign currencydenominated senior notes for which payments of interest and principal are to be made in foreign currency and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could cause the expense associated with such payments to increase in addition we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into us dollars any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

first data acquisition risks 

the synergies attributable to the acquisition may vary from expectations 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the success of the acquisition will depend in significant part on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination this growth and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected actual operating technological strategic synergy and revenue 

opportunities may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition within the anticipated timing our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to the integration 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of first data there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including our business operating platforms purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing and benefits while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that we will continue to incur are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

our future results will be negatively impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

as a result of the acquisition the size of our business has increased significantly our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations integrating complex systems technology networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies potential unknown liabilities and associated increased costs we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of our business any of these issues could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results

industry trends 

the global payments landscape continues to evolve with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments ecommerce and innovation in realtime payments infrastructure because of this growth competition also continues to evolve business and consumer expectations continue to rise with a focus on convenience and security to meet these expectations payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience 

financial institutions 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment deposit risk management lending and investment products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

the focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated these fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth 

merchants 

the rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and ecommerce driven by consumers’ desire for simpler more efficient shopping experiences has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in highgrowth online and mobile settings which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments merchants are demanding simpler integrated and modern pos systems to help manage their everyday business operations when combined with the everincreasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services merchants have sought modern pos systems to streamline this complexity furthermore merchants can now search discover compare purchase and even install a new pos system through direct digitalonly experiences this direct digitalonly channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities especially with respect to smaller merchants 

in addition there are numerous softwareasaservice “saas” solutions in the industry many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships saas solutions that integrate payments are often referred to as independent software vendors or “isvs” and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us 

we believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes from small and midsized businesses or “smbs” to mediumsized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants and across all verticals furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of small medium and large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions gives us a solid foundation for growth 

recent market conditions 

in 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was identified and has since continued to spread in march 2020 the world health organization recognized the covid19 outbreak as a pandemic in response to the covid19 pandemic the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have taken actions to prevent the spread of covid19 such as imposing travel restrictions and bans quarantines social distancing guidelines shelterinplace or lockdown orders and other similar limitations adversely impacting global economic activity and contributing to significant volatility in financial markets from time to time during the second half of 2020 and into 2021 some jurisdictions have eased restrictions in an effort to reopen their economies while this has been successful in some places others have had to reinstate restrictions to curb the spread of the virus 

we have taken several actions since the onset of the pandemic to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees while maintaining business continuity these actions include among others requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely eliminating nonessential travel suspending all nonessential visitors to our facilities disinfecting facilities and workspaces extensively and frequently providing personal protective equipment to associates and requiring employees who 

must be present at our facilities to adhere to a variety of safety protocols in addition we have expanded paid timeoff for employees impacted by covid19 provided increased pay for certain employees involved in critical infrastructure who could not work remotely and expanded our fiserv cares program to benefit employees in need around the world we expect to continue such safety measures for the foreseeable future and may take further actions or adapt these existing policies as government authorities may require or recommend or as we may determine to be in the best interest of our employees clients and vendors 

our operating performance is subject to global economic and market conditions as well as their impacts on levels of consumer and business spending as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the related decline in global economic activity we experienced a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions beginning in late march 2020 that negatively impacted our merchant acquiring and paymentrelated businesses which earn transactionbased fees as well as modest declines in other businesses merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes began to partially recover in may 2020 and continued to improve into july 2020 thereafter the monthly volume growth rate as compared to the prior year stabilized for the balance of the year while recent business trends demonstrate positive momentum the uncertainty caused by the pandemic creates an economic environment where our future financial results remain difficult to anticipate we currently expect payments volume and transactions to continue to improve throughout 2021 

throughout 2020 we also took several actions to manage discretionary costs including among others limiting the hiring of new employees limiting thirdparty spending and the temporary suspension of certain employeerelated benefits including company matching contributions to the fiserv 401k savings plan as well as the discount on shares purchased under the fiserv inc amended and restated employee stock purchase plan effective january 1 2021 company matching contributions were reestablished to equal 100 on the first 1 contributed and 25 on the next 4 contributed for eligible participants in addition we reassessed and deferred certain capital expenditures that were originally planned for 2020 we will continue to monitor and assess developments related to covid19 and implement appropriate actions to minimize the risk to our operations of any material adverse developments ultimately the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on among other matters the duration and intensity of the covid19 pandemic governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us the level of success of global vaccination efforts and the impact of the pandemic on our employees clients vendors operations and sales all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates growth and retention rates royalty rates expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level which is one level below our reportable segments when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test 

the quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

in connection with the segment realignment certain of our reporting units changed in composition in which goodwill was allocated to such reporting units using a relative fair value approach accordingly we performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2020 for those reporting units impacted by the segment realignment and determined that our goodwill was not impaired based on an assessment of various qualitative factors as described above our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2020 determined that our goodwill of 36 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values however for four of our reporting units that were acquired as part of the first data acquisition with aggregate goodwill of 12 billion the excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair value over carrying value ranged from 14 to 21 percent if future operating performance is below our expectations or there are changes to forecasted revenue growth rates riskadjusted discount rates effective income tax rates or some combination thereof a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in and we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge it is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on certain of our recently acquired recorded at fair value first data businesses such as an increased duration and intensity of the pandemic andor governmentimposed shutdowns prolonged economic downturn or recession or lack of governmental support for recovery could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment we have no accumulated goodwill impairment through december 31 2020 additional information regarding our goodwill is included in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable we review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset depending on the type of asset determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties as a practical expedient we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less contracts with customers are evaluated on a contractbycontract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below 

processing and services 

processing and services revenue is generated from account and transactionbased fees for data processing merchant transaction processing and acquiring electronic billing and payment services electronic funds transfer and debitcredit processing services consulting and professional services and software maintenance for ongoing client support 

we recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which case revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and ifneeded basis a standready obligation and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining tierbased price per unit based on volume of service however pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis 

product 

product revenue is generated from print and card production sales as well as software license sales for software license agreements that are distinct we recognize software license revenue upon delivery assuming a contract is deemed to exist revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended such as labor hours to measure progress towards completion for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 

we also sell or lease hardware pos devices and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers hardware typically consists of terminals or clover devices we do not manufacture hardware rather we purchase hardware from thirdparty vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer we account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware 

significant judgments 

we use the following methods inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize for multielement arrangements we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer if these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers 

the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained we include an estimate of the variable amount as appropriate within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted the transaction price including any discounts or rebates is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multielement arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service 

contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or when a customer terminates some or all of the existing services provided by us when a contract modification occurs it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as i a separate contract ii the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract or iii a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract further contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation 

additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws sometimes made more complex by our global footprint judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item in establishing a liability for known tax exposures assumptions are made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position will be sustained a tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date the amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate 

we maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when based upon the weight of all available evidence we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies however there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment to the extent our judgment changes the valuation allowances are then adjusted generally through the provision for income taxes in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs additional information regarding our income taxes is included in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

financial results 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from yeartoyear this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the financial results presented below have been affected by the acquisition of first data and other acquisitions dispositions debt financing activities and foreign currency fluctuations the amounts from the acquired first data businesses were included in our results for the full year in 2020 and for the five months since the july 292019 acquisition date in 2019 

1 percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue expense income or loss amount divided by total revenue except for cost of processing and services and cost of product amounts which are divided by the related component of revenue 



1 represents the basis point growth or decline in operating margin 

operating margin percentages are calculated using actual unrounded amounts 

total revenue

the operating loss in corporate and other increased 1230 million in 2020 and increased 1519 million in 2019 compared to the prior years the increase in corporate and other operating loss was primarily due to the acquisition of first data including incremental amortization of acquired intangible assets of 1035 million and 799 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively incremental acquisition and integrationrelated costs of 441 million and 275 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively and other first data related corporate expenses since the date of acquisition corporate and other was favorably impacted by gains from sales of businesses of 464 million 15 million and 227 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and negatively impacted in 2019 by a 48 million noncash impairment charge related to an international core processing platform 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 236 million or 50 in 2020 and increased 284 million or 150 in 2019 compared to prior years primarily due to the june 2019 issuance of 90 billion of fixedrate senior notes the july 2019 issuance of €15 billion and £105 billion of fixedrate senior notes and the term loan borrowings that were incurred for the purpose of funding the repayment of certain indebtedness of first data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the acquisition as well as the september 2018 issuance of 20 billion of fixedrate notes 

debt financing activities 

in connection with the merger agreement entered into on january 16 2019 to acquire first data we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter providing for a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 170 billion for the purpose of refinancing certain indebtedness of first data on the closing date of the acquisition we recorded 98 million of expense in 2019 associated with the bridge term loan facility and other refinancing and related activities in connection with the acquisition of first data in addition in 2019 we recorded 50 million of net foreign currency transaction gains related to our foreign currencydenominated debt in 2018 we completed a cash tender offer for and redemption of our thenoutstanding 450 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior notes due 2020 which resulted in a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 14 million

income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

our share of net income or loss from affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting including merchant bank alliance affiliates from the acquisition of first data is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense or benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting was 0 million 29 million and 10 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to i fund normal operating expenses ii meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness including finance leases and iii fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations along with our cash and cash equivalents of 906 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 34 billion at december 31 2020 the following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively  our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 41 billion in 2020 an increase of 48 compared with 28 billion in 2019 this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first data net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included a payment of 183 million associated with the settlement of treasury lock agreements related to refinancing certain indebtedness assumed as part of the first data acquisition 

our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 6 and 7 of our total revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

share repurchases

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2020 we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes our term loans and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents 

investments other than those included in settlement assets with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents at december 31 2020 and 2019 we held 906 million and 893 million in cash and cash equivalents respectively 

the table below details the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 

1 represents cash held primarily by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors for said entities declares a dividend as well as cash held by certain other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements 

employee termination costs 

in connection with the acquisition of first data we continue to implement integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure including eliminating duplicate costs we recorded 131 million and 32 million of employee termination costs related to severance and other separation costs for terminated employees in connection with the acquisition of first data during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively accrued employee severance and other separation costs of 27 million at december 31 2020 are expected to be paid within the next twelve months we continue to evaluate operating efficiencies and anticipate incurring additional costs in connection with these activities but are unable to estimate those amounts at this time as such plans are not yet finalized 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty as to general global economic and market conditions we believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business however as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity needs the ability to continue to service debt and meet lease and other obligations as they come due is dependent on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows a lack of continued recovery or further deterioration in economic and market conditions could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity particularly our cash flows from operations 

we engage in regular communication with the banks that participate in our revolving credit facility during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote as evidenced by our may 2020 senior notes offering described above the longterm debt markets have historically provided us with a source of liquidity although we do not currently 

anticipate an inability to obtain financing from longterm debt markets in the future effects of the covid19 pandemic could make financing more difficult andor expensive to obtain our ability to access the longterm debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms also depends on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness as of december 31 2020 we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services in the event that the ratings of our outstanding longterm debt securities were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of longterm debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings our ability to access the debt markets could be adversely affected and our interest expense could increase under the terms of certain of our longterm debt securities 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing the following table details our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 

1 interest finance lease operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pretax basis 

2 the calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made no additional refinancing or lending occurs except for our 475 notes due in june 2021 as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a longterm basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in september 2023 and the variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at december 31 2020 

3 excludes 30 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for finance leases that have been signed but not yet commenced 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed to certain market risks primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our senior management actively monitors these risks 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use a combination of fixed and variablerate debt instruments to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations we had fixed and variablerate debt excluding finance leases and other financing obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 183 billion and 18 billion respectively at december 31 2020 our fixedrate debt at december 31 2020 primarily consisted of fixedrate senior notes with a fair value of 207 million based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities the potential change in fair value of our fixedrate senior notes from a hypothetical 1 change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate debt instruments before their maturity our variablerate debt at december 31 2020 primarily consisted of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility variable rate term loan foreign lines of credit and debt associated with the receivables securitization agreement based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2020 a hypothetical 1 increase in market interest rates related to our variablerate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately 18 million this sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at december 31 2020 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interestrelated income that we earn on these investments a hypothetical 1 decrease in market interest rates would decrease annual interestrelated income related to settlement assets by approximately 

30 million over the next twelve months this sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at december 31 2020 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollardenominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and nonderivative net investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency approximately 13 and 12 of our total revenue was generated outside the us in 2020 and 2019 respectively the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the euro the british pound the indian rupee and the argentine peso a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10 would have resulted in a decrease or increase  respectively in our reported pretax income as follows at december 31  we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in india at december 31 2020 the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 259 million with a positive fair value of 9 million in addition we designated our foreign currencydenominated senior notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology and payment systems data processing affiliates of large companies processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives financial institutions independent sales organizations “isos” independent software vendors and payments companies our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new technologies and wellfunded competitors including large technology telecommunication media and other companies not historically in the financial services and payments industries startups and international providers of products and services similar to ours in addition participants in the financial services payments and technology industries may merge create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to keep pace with technological change we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and increasing client expectations our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance we must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain competitive within our relevant markets for example our ability to provide innovative pointofsale technology to our merchant clients could have an impact on our merchant acquiring business and new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industrywide solutions and standards related to tokenization or other safety and security technologies if we are unable to anticipate or respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely basis our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected in addition the success of certain of our products and services rely in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance and compete effectively or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services or to perform the services inhouse some of our competitors may offer more attractive fees or other services that we do not offer and some clients may desire to perform the services themselves larger clients may be able to seek lower prices from us when they renew or extend a contract or the client’s business has significant volume changes in addition larger clients may reduce the services we provide if they decide to move services inhouse further our small merchant business clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures such clients experience from their customers on some occasions these factors result in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our merchant and financial institution relationships and alliances and if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances our business may be adversely affected 

under our alliance program a bank or other institution forms an alliance with us generally on an exclusive basis either contractually or through a separate legal entity merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us andor the bank or institution the banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant we provide transaction processing and related functions to the alliance both we and our alliance partners may also provide management sales marketing and other administrative services the alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions any one of which may be selected by the merchant as its bank partner our merchant acquiring business depends in part on our merchant relationships alliances and other distribution channels there can be no guarantee that we will achieve growth in our merchant relationships alliances or other distribution channels in addition our contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are for fixed terms and may allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions stop providing clearing services or limit our volumes we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services the loss of merchant relationships or alliance and financial institution partners could negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

mergers consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services our alliance strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations especially where the financial institutions involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could expose us to liability or damage our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our employees our clients and their customers under the card network rules various federal state and international laws and client contracts we are responsible for information provided to us by financial institutions merchants independent sales organizations thirdparty service providers and others the confidentiality of such sensitive business information and personal consumer information residing on our systems is critical to our business any unauthorized access intrusion infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients partners or vendors these incidents are often difficult to detect and are constantly evolving we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities and those of our clients partners and vendors through various means and with increasing sophistication these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and that none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place to detect security incidents and protect sensitive data including protection against unauthorized access and use by our employees will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging technological risks and threats the impact of a material event involving our systems and data or those of our clients partners or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures and resulting interruptions in the implementation or availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of our processing and other systems an operational failure and the resulting implementation delays or service interruption could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could 

involve the hardware software data networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control events that could cause operational failures include but are not limited to hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events implementation delays interruptions of service or hardware device defects could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits product recalls or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue and significantly impact our clients’ businesses and the customers they serve in addition a significant implementation delay interruption of service or product recall could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services 

the operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected many of the transactions involving our products and services rely on multiple participants in the global financial system to move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain a disruption for any reason of the operations of a participant in the global financial system could impact our ability to obtain or provide information or cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our products and services although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective such a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services reputational damage lost clients and revenue loss of clients’ and their customers’ confidence as well as additional costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we rely on third parties to provide products and services we could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations 

our business depends on third parties to provide us with certain products and services the failure of these vendors to properly perform their obligations in a timely manner could expose us and our clients to information security financial compliance and reputational risks among others and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition if we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost which would negatively impact our results of operations 

our merchants may be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable 

we are subject to the risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable for example we and our merchant acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants if we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant because of the merchant’s insolvency or other reasons we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder although we have an active program to manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent transactions including electronic payment and card transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud we also rely on isos to sell our merchant processing services which they may do by contracting with their own subisos we rely on these isos and subisos to exercise appropriate controls to avoid fraudulent transactions it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback responsibilities would increase our chargeback liability exposure to fines or other liabilities increases in chargebacks fines or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with operations outside of the united states and as we continue to expand internationally we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks 

we offer merchant acquiring processing and issuing services outside of the us including in the uk germany argentina india and brazil our facilities outside of the us and those of our suppliers and vendors including manufacturing customer support software development and technology hosting facilities are subject to risks including natural disasters public health crises political crises terrorism war political instability and other events outside of our or our suppliers’ control as we expand internationally and grow our client base outside of the us we may face challenges due to the presence of more established competitors and our lack of experience in such nonus markets and we may incur higher than anticipated costs if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with the international operation and expansion of our business our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

a disruptive implementation of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are monitoring developments related to the implementation of the decision of the uk to exit the european union the “eu” referred to as “brexit” which could among other outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services data and people between the uk and the eu undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the eu the effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets these agreements could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have and how such withdrawal will affect us 

in addition brexit may create additional uncertainty in currency exchange rate fluctuations that may result in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business we translate revenue denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international revenue and profit is reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer us dollars any of these effects of brexit among others could materially adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future clients and vendors which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and business opportunities 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks including the card networks which we own and operate increase the processing and other fees including what is commonly known as “interchange fees” that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future or result in us not being able to increase our own fees which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin limit our growth and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

our failure to comply with applicable complex laws and regulations could harm our businesses and subject us to liability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business including payments industry cybersecurity and data privacy regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and our ability to obtain new clients could be inhibited which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our clients are also subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks financial institutions and card issuers in the us and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by these federal state local and foreign laws and regulations furthermore these laws and regulations are constantly changing with new laws and regulations and interpretations thereof being implemented 

we operate our business around the world including in certain foreign countries with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws applicable to us including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies and training programs to discourage such practices however there can be no assurance that all of our employees consultants and agents will comply with our policies and all applicable laws 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in jurisdictions where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment digital disbursements and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the us including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities our subsidiary money network financial llc provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the financial crimes enforcement network certain of our businesses are also subject to antimoney laundering regulations outside the us the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing merchant acquiring money transmitter services or prepaid programs in particular jurisdictions 

failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations or changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal state local or foreign governments may result in significant financial penalties reputational harm or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks and nacha they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our transaction processing services several of our subsidiaries are registered with visa and mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions as such we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us acquiring clients processing clients and merchants in addition we are subject to rules of the national automated clearing house association “nacha” as well as the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of nacha and the card networks are set by their respective boards some of which are our competitors and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services 

if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated the suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications or any changes to the association and network rules that we do not successfully address or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the united states have been adopted including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us in addition the cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services including many offered by our clients restricts debit card fees paid by merchants to certain issuer banks and allows merchants to offer discounts for different payment methods cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changes to the doddfrank act or regulations could adversely impact our debit network business in addition certain of our alliance partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

to the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions additional regulation examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations or limit our ability to update our existing products and services or require us to develop new ones any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in 2018 extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location subject to certain limitations the law requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data our efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws such as the new california consumer privacy act effective as of january 2020 and the brazilian general data protection law effective as of february 2020 could involve substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and limit the services we are able to offer further failure to comply with applicable laws in this area could also result in fines penalties and reputational damage us banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our financial institution clients and that would address cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems invest in new systems or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy if any of these outcomes were to occur our operational costs could increase significantly 

failure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect   our   business 

through our merchant alliances we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses in order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program notwithstanding our compliance program it is possible that perceived or actual violations of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions regulatory scrutiny of or regulatory enforcement action in connection with compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against thirdparty infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy it is also possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology further we use open source software in connection with our solutions companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of solutions developed using open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software effective patent trademark service mark copyright 

and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available the laws of certain nonus countries where we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the us misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients or client data negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

acquisitions subject us to risks including assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult or expensive to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry and our merchant acquiring business given this focus we are exposed to global economic conditions and adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such trends may include but are not limited to the following 

 a weakening in the economy or competition from other retailers could also force some retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices 

a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect   our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations we have established contingency reserves for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there is no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect   our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our operations are subject to tax by federal state local and international taxing jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations in our significant tax jurisdictions could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations for example the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” significantly revised the us corporate income tax code by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorialtype tax system and imposing repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries further analysis of the tax act or future regulations or guidance from the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow furthermore our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 69 of our total assets at december 31 2019 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

existing or future leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2019 we had approximately 219 billion of debt we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if certain of our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 

an increase   in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense at december 31 2019 we had approximately 48 billion in variable rate debt which includes 40 billion on our term loans 324 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and lines of credit and 500 million drawn on our accounts receivable securitization facility based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2019 a 1 increase in variable interest rates would result in a decrease to annual pretax income of 48 million  

our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by such international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedging instruments to mitigate the market value risks associated with foreign currencydenominated transactions and investments these hedging strategies may not however eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation and we may forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if currency exchange rates were to change in our favor we have also issued foreign currencydenominated senior notes for which payments of interest and principal are to be made in foreign currency and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could 

cause the expense associated with such payments to increase in addition we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into us dollars any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential tariffs or trade wars could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results 

the us has imposed tariffs on certain imports from china including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in china if the us administration imposes additional tariffs or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the us or other countries our hardware devices produced in china could be impacted although it is too early to predict how current or future tariffs on items imported from china or elsewhere will impact our business the cost of our products manufactured in china and imported into the us or other countries could increase which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks relating to the first data acquisition 

we may be unable to integrate the business of first data successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the combination of two independent businesses is complex costly and time consuming and we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 any of these issues could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

the synergies attributable to the acquisition may vary from expectations 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the success of the acquisition will depend in significant part on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination we believe that the addition of first data will complement our strategy by providing scale and revenue diversity accelerate our growth strategy and enable us to have a strong global footprint however achieving these goals requires growth of the revenue of the combined company and realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from the acquisition this growth and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected actual operating technological strategic synergy and revenue opportunities may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition within the anticipated timing our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of first data there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing and benefits while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the transaction and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

as a result of the acquisition the size of our business has increased significantly our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of our business there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the acquisition 

the first data transaction may result in a loss of customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners or other business partners and may result in the termination of existing contracts

we frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy we expect to acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need such as a product service or technology that helps meet client demand an opportunity to change industry dynamics a way to achieve business scale or similar considerations we expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market product or financial strategies 

acquisitions 

on july 29 2019 we completed the acquisition of first data corporation for a total purchase price of 465 billion by acquiring 100 of the first data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition as a result of the 

acquisition first data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of fiserv inc at an exchange ratio of 0303 shares of fiserv inc for each share of first data common stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares we also converted 15 million outstanding first data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of fiserv inc in accordance with the exchange ratio in addition concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we made a cash payment of 164 billion to repay existing first data debt we funded the transactionrelated expenses and the repayment of first data debt through a combination of available cash onhand proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings the acquisition of first data increases our footprint as a global payments and financial technology provider by expanding the portfolio of services provided to financial institutions corporate and merchant clients and consumers

dispositions 

on december 4 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a 60 controlling interest of our investment services business which is reported within the payments segment on february 18 2020  we completed the sale of the 60 interest of this business to a group of investors for gross proceeds of 591 million  resulting in an estimated pretax gain including the remeasurement of the company’s retained interest of approximately 430 million  our 40 retained interest will be accounted for as an equity method investment 

in connection with the acquisition of first data we acquired two businesses which we intended to sell in october 2019 we completed the sales at acquired fair value of these two businesses for aggregate proceeds of 133 million 

in march 2018 we sold a 55 interest of our lending solutions business which was reported within the financial segment retaining 45 ownership interests in two joint ventures the “lending joint ventures” in conjunction with this transaction we entered into transition services agreements to provide at fair value various administration business process outsourcing and data center related services for defined periods to the lending joint ventures we received gross sale proceeds of 419 million from the transactions in august 2019 the sagent auto llc joint venture formerly known as fiserv automotive solutions llc completed a merger with a thirdparty resulting in the dilution of our ownership interest to 31 in the new combined entity defi solutions group llc “defi solutions” in addition in january 2018 we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of monitise for proceeds of £37 million  50 million  and in may 2017 we sold our australian item processing business which was reported within the financial segment for approximately 17 million

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to move money and information in a way that moves the world these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our 

products and services through innovation during 2019 our key enterprise priorities were to i deliver integration value from the first data acquisition ii continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals iii enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and iv deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients 

industry trends 

the global payments landscape continues to evolve with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments ecommerce and innovation in realtime payments infrastructure because of this growth competition also continues to evolve business and consumer expectations continue to rise with a focus on convenience and security to meet these expectations payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology utilizing data and enhancing the customer experience 

financial institutions 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment deposit risk management lending and investment products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

the focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated these fees can vary from period to period our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth 

merchants 

the rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and ecommerce driven by consumers’ desire for simpler more efficient shopping experiences has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in highgrowth online and mobile settings which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments merchants are demanding simpler integrated and modern pos systems to help manage their everyday business operations when combined with the everincreasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services merchants have sought modern pos systems to streamline this complexity furthermore merchants can now search discover compare purchase and even install a new pos system through direct digitalonly experiences this direct digitalonly channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities especially with respect to smaller merchants 

additionally there are numerous softwareasaservice “saas” solutions in the industry many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software in a way to further monetize their client relationships saas solutions that 

integrate payments are often referred to as independent software vendors or isvs and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates growth and retention rates royalty rates expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2019 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values except for the reporting units related to the acquisition of first data an assessment of qualitative factors including the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end reporting period did not identify indicators of impairment in relation to the first data goodwill goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of first data is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions using information available at the reporting date and therefore the potential for measurement period adjustments exists based on our continuing review of matters related to the acquisition we have no accumulated goodwill impairment through december 31 2019 see note 8 for additional information 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on 

estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the delivery of processing service and product solutions revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may be at a point in time or over time as a practical expedient we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less contracts with customers are evaluated on a contractbycontract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below 

processing and services 

processing and services revenue is generated from account and transactionbased fees for data processing transaction processing merchant acquiring and ecommerce electronic billing and payment services electronic funds transfer and debit processing services consulting and professional services and software maintenance for ongoing client support 

we recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and if needed basis a standready obligation and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining tierbased price per unit based on volume of service however pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis 

product 

product revenue is generated from integrated print and card production sales as well as software license sales for software license agreements that are distinct we recognize software license revenue upon delivery assuming a contract is deemed to exist revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended such as labor hours to measure progress towards completion for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 

we also sell or lease hardware pos devices and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers hardware typically consists of terminals or clover ® devices we do not manufacture hardware rather we purchase hardware from thirdparty vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer we account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware 

significant judgments 

we use the following methods inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize for multielement arrangements we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer if these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers 

the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained we include an estimate of the variable amount as appropriate within 

the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted the transaction price including any discounts is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multielement arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service 

contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or when a customer terminates some or all of the existing services provided by us when a contract modification occurs it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as i a separate contract ii the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract or iii a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract further contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation 

additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included within note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws including our increased global footprint judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item in establishing a liability for known tax exposures assumptions are made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position will be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate 

we primarily through our first data acquisition maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when based upon the weight of all available evidence we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we believe that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized because of the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the tax law however we have established valuation allowances for those deferred tax assets that in our judgment will not be realized in making this determination we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies however there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment to the extent our judgment changes the valuation allowances are then adjusted generally through the provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2019  we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes our term loans and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent  in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents 

investments other than those included in settlement assets with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents at december 31 2019 and 2018  we held  893 million and 415 million in cash and cash equivalents respectively 

the table below details the cash and cash equivalents at december 31 





restructuring costs 

in connection with the acquisition of first data we have begun implementing certain integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure including vendor spend and the elimination of duplicate costs we recorded restructuring charges related to certain of these integration activities of 56 million primarily reported in cost of processing and service and selling general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of income based upon committed actions during the year ended december 31 2019 we continue to evaluate operating efficiencies and anticipate incurring additional costs in the next few years in connection with these activities but are unable to estimate those amounts at this time as such plans are not yet finalized 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing the following table details our contractual obligations at december 31 2019  








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

interest rate risk 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31 2019  a 1 increase in variable interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 48 million  

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients a 1 decrease in variable interest rates would decrease annual interestrelated income related to settlement assets by approximately 32 million  

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollardenominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and nonderivative net investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency in 2019  approximately 12 of our total revenue was generated outside the us the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the euro the british pound the indian rupee and the argentine peso a movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated at 

december 31 2019 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our reported pretax income including the results of first data from the date of acquisition of approximately 25 million as follows 

we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in india at december 31 2019 the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 178 million  in addition we designated our foreign currencydenominated senior notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations may require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us such as those related to security and privacy and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their auditors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks relating to our existing business 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new wellfunded competitors and new technologies including large technology media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry startups and international providers of similar products and services to ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and increasing client expectations our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance in addition the success of certain of our products and services rely in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five  years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

mergers consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data or those of our clients or vendors could expose us to liability or damage our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized access intrusion infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients or vendors these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny 

financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition as threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of our processing and other systems an operational failure and the resulting service interruption could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could involve the hardware software data networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control events that could cause operational failures include but are not limited to hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue and significantly impact our clients’ businesses and the customers they serve in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the united states have been adopted including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us in addition federal and state governments and governmental authorities outside the us have adopted or are pursuing numerous additional regulations impacting the financial services industry including regulations related to cybersecurity and data privacy to the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions additional regulation examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations or limit our ability to update our existing products and services or require us to develop new ones any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

if we fail to comply with regulations applicable to our business including cybersecurity and data privacy regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those jurisdictions where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment digital disbursements and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of nacha and the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to rules of the national automated clearing house association “nacha” as well as card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations including the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of nacha and the card networks are set by their respective boards and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the association and network rules that we do not successfully address or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could cause us to modify current estimates about the impact that it will have on us which could negatively impact our anticipated earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act significantly revises the us corporate income tax code by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorialstyle tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries our financial results for 2018 included additional income tax expense of 

approximately 19 million  resulting from new interpretive guidance issued by the internal revenue service further analysis of this complex legislation or future regulations or guidance from the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 70  of our total assets at december 31 2018  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 60 billion  of debt we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 

risks relating to the proposed merger with first data 

the merger is subject to a number of conditions to our and first data’s obligations to complete the merger which if not fulfilled or not fulfilled in a timely manner may result in termination of the merger agreement 

our and first data’s respective obligations to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the effective time of the merger of the following conditions 



 many of the conditions to completion of the merger are not within our or first data’s control and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied if any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to october 16 2019 which date may be extended once to january 16 2020 and extended a second time to april 16 2020 it is possible that the merger agreement may be terminated although we and first data have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts subject to certain limitations to complete the merger as promptly as practicable these and other conditions to the completion of the merger may fail to be satisfied in addition satisfying the conditions to and completion of the merger may take longer and could cost more than we expect we cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring any delay in completing the merger may adversely affect the cost savings and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe there can be no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained or obtained prior to the termination date 

the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on us following the merger or if not obtained could prevent the completion of the merger 

before the merger can be completed waiting periods must expire or terminate under applicable antitrust laws including the hsr act and various approvals consents or clearances must be obtained from certain other us and nonus regulatory authorities in deciding whether to grant antitrust or regulatory clearances the relevant authorities will consider the effect of the merger on competition in the case of competition authorities and a variety of other factors in the case of other authorities although we and first data have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to make certain governmental filings and subject to certain limitations obtain the required governmental authorizations as the case may be there can be no assurance that the relevant authorizations will be obtained 

the governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations the terms and conditions of approvals that are granted may require that the parties divest certain businesses assets or products prior to or after the closing of the merger or impose requirements limitations costs or restrictions on the conduct of us following the closing of the merger at any time before or after completion of the merger notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino act the us department of justice or the federal trade commission or any state or foreign governmental entity could take such action under the antitrust laws as each deems necessary or desirable in the public interest including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of ours or first data private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances 

under the terms of the merger agreement subject to certain conditions both parties are required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all of the foregoing authorizations or approvals notwithstanding the foregoing “reasonable best efforts” does not require us in connection with obtaining hartscottrodino clearance or any other approval required pursuant to any other antitrust or competition law in the unites states to i defend any lawsuit or challenge any other action by any governmental entity adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the merger ii sell divest or otherwise encumber any asset or business or iii agree to any limits or restrictions on certain actions 

there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose terms conditions requirements limitations costs or restrictions that would delay the completion of the merger impose additional material costs on or limit the revenues of us after the merger or limit some of the cost savings and other benefits that we expect following completion of the merger in addition we cannot provide any assurance that any such terms conditions requirements limitations costs or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the merger in addition disruptions in government operations such as the recent shutdown of the us government could cause delay in obtaining approvals or increase processing times any delay in completing the merger or any modification to the merger currently contemplated may adversely affect the timing and amount of cost savings and other benefits that are expected to be achieved from the merger there can be no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained or obtained prior to the termination date 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

if the merger is not completed for any reason including as a result of failure to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals if our shareholders fail to approve the issuance of shares to first data shareholders in connection with the merger or if first data’s shareholders fail to approve the consummation of the merger our ongoing businesses may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger we would be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 if the merger is not completed the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial position and stock prices 

our and first data’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position following the merger 

parties with which we or first data do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to our or first data’s current or future business relationships following the merger our and first data’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners may attempt to delay or defer entering into new business relationships negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or first data following the merger these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our or first data’s results of operations cash flows and financial position regardless of whether the merger is completed as well as a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected cost savings and other benefits of the merger the risk and adverse effect of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect our future business and operations following the merger 

we depend on the experience and industry knowledge of officers and other key employees to execute our business plans our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees our and first data’s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the merger or other concerns regarding the timing and completion of the merger or our operations following the merger any of which may have an adverse effect on our or first data’s ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel if we or first data are unable to retain personnel including our and first data’s key management who are critical to the future operations of the companies we could face disruptions in our operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs in addition the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger no assurance can be given that we following the merger will be able to retain or attract key management personnel and other key employees to the same extent that we and first data have previously been able to retain or attract their own employees 

the merger agreement subjects us and first data to restrictions on our respective business activities prior to the effective time of the merger 

the merger agreement subjects us and first data to restrictions on our respective business activities prior to the effective time of the merger the merger agreement obligates us and first data to generally operate its businesses in the ordinary course until the effective time of the merger and to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization and advantageous business relationships on its actions these restrictions could prevent us and first data from pursuing certain business opportunities that arise prior to the effective time of the merger and are outside the ordinary course of business 

we may not be able to obtain our preferred form of debt financing in connection with the merger and on anticipated terms 

we expect to fund the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness of first data and its subsidiaries on the closing date making of cash payments in lieu of fractional shares as part of the merger consideration and paying of fees and expenses related to the merger the refinancing and the related transactions using a combination of cash on hand the issuance of 12 billion in debt securities the incurrence of 5 billion in borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility and borrowings under our revolving credit facility we have executed a 5 billion senior unsecured term loan facility and amendments to our existing revolving credit facility to increase the size of that facility and make other changes although drawing under each facility is subject to certain conditions with respect to the plan to issue 12 billion in debt securities there is a risk that the markets will not allow us to execute this financing plan or that such financing will not be available on favorable terms as a result we may need to pursue other options to refinance the outstanding debt of first data and its subsidiaries and fund these other amounts including borrowing amounts under the bridge facility which may result in less favorable financing terms that could increase costs andor adversely impact the operations of the combined company 

risks relating to fiserv following the proposed merger with first data 

we may be unable to integrate the business of first data successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies the combination of two independent businesses is complex costly and time consuming and we and first data will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our and first data’s business practices and operations potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 in addition we and first data have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in 

 any of these issues could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results following the merger 

our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to completion of the merger this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense 

as of december 31 2018 we had total indebtedness of approximately 6 billion and first data had total indebtedness of approximately 18 billion upon completion of the merger we expect to incur acquisitionrelated debt financing of approximately 17 billion all of which is expected to be used to refinance certain outstanding indebtedness of first data and its subsidiaries on the closing date pay cash in lieu of fractional shares as part of the merger consideration and pay fees and expenses related to the merger the refinancing and the related transactions in addition we have obtained an increase of 15 billion in the commitments available to us under our existing revolving credit facility which increase is subject to the closing of the merger and certain other conditions accordingly our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to completion of the merger our substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the merger could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions in addition the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels will increase following completion of the transaction and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the merger we will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the financing of the merger the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the merger could also reduce funds available to fund our efforts to integrate the business of first data and realize the expected benefits of the merger and to engage in investments in product development for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness or to reduce leverage levels based on debt repayment or cash flow generation may be adversely impacted 

the indebtedness we incur under our new 5 billion term loan facility in connection with the merger and any indebtedness we incur under our revolving credit facility will bear interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flows in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations in connection with the debt financing it is anticipated that we will seek ratings of its indebtedness from moody’s investors service inc and sp global ratings there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that our ratings will not be adversely affected by the factors described above 

moreover we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the estimated potential synergies attributable to the merger may vary from expectations 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the merger which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the success of the merger will depend in significant part on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination we believe that the addition of first data will complement our strategy by providing scale and revenue diversity accelerate our growth strategy and enable us to have a strong global footprint however achieving these goals requires growth of the revenue of the combined company and realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from the merger this growth and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected actual operating technological strategic and revenue opportunities if achieved at all may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the merger within the anticipated timing or at all our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and integration 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the related integration there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing and benefits while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

our future results following the merger will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

following the merger the size of our business will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or first data’s business our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its business there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

following the merger our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical regulatory and other risks associated with operations outside of the united states and we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks 

after completion of the merger we will have significantly expanded our international presence by offering merchant acquiring processing and issuing services outside of the united states including in argentina brazil germany india ireland the netherlands poland and the united kingdom where first data’s principal nonus operations are currently located our revenues derived from these and other nonus operations will be subject to additional risks including those resulting from social and geopolitical instability and unfavorable political or diplomatic developments all of which could negatively impact our financial results for example the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union may add cost and complexity in various aspects of our business as united kingdom and european union laws and regulations diverge we will also be subject to potential nonus governmental intervention and new laws and new regulations that we were not previously subject to which could increase costs and may have potential negative effects on our business 

the merger may result in a loss of customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners or other business partners and may result in the termination of existing contracts 

following the merger some of our or first data’s customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with us some customers may not wish to source a larger percentage of their needs from a single company or may feel that we are too closely allied with one of their competitors in addition we and first data have contracts with customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners that may require us or first data to obtain consents from these other parties in connection with the merger which may not be obtained on favorable terms or at all if relationships with customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners are adversely affected by the merger or if we following the merger lose the benefits of our or first data’s contracts our business and financial performance could suffer 

following the merger first data’s global business solutions business as integrated into fiserv will depend in part on merchant relationships and alliances if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances our business may be adversely affected 

after completion of the merger our alliance structures are expected to continue as they did at first data to take different forms including consolidated subsidiaries equity method investments and revenue sharing arrangements under first data’s current alliance program and as is expected to continue with the combined company a bank or other institution forms an alliance with first data on an exclusive basis either contractually or through a separate legal entity merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by first data andor the bank or institution the banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant first data provides transaction processing and related functions both first data and its alliance partners may also provide management sales marketing and other administrative services the alliance structure allows first data to be the processor for multiple financial institutions any one of which may 

be selected by the merchant as its bank partner first data’s global business solutions business and the combined company is expected to continue to be dependent in part on merchant relationships alliances and other distribution channels first data is working and we expect the combined company to continue to work with alliance partners to grow their businesses there can be no guarantee that first data’s or the combined company’s efforts will be successful and that first data or the combined company will achieve growth in merchant relationships alliances and other distribution channels in addition first data’s contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are and the combined company’s are expected to continue to be for fixed terms and may also allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events there can be no assurance that first data or the combined company will be able to renew contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all following the merger the loss of merchant relationships or alliance and financial institution partners could negatively impact our business and result in a reduction of its revenue and profit 

new omaha holdings lp may sell a substantial amount of our common stock shortly after the completion of the merger as certain restrictions on sales expire and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

pursuant to a shareholder agreement new omaha holdings lp “new omaha” which is expected to own approximately 16 of our outstanding shares upon the closing of the merger transaction is prohibited from selling shares of our common stock for the first three months following the completion of the merger after the threemonth anniversary of the completion of the merger new omaha may sell such shares subject to certain limitations contained in the shareholder agreement additionally under the registration rights agreement we have granted new omaha registration rights which permit among others underwritten offerings the registration rights agreement will terminate when the aggregate ownership percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock held by new omaha and its affiliate transferees falls below 2 and such shares may be freely sold without restrictions 

new omaha may have influence over us following completion of the merger and its interests may conflict with other shareholders 

upon completion of the merger new omaha is expected to own approximately 16 of our issued and outstanding shares and is expected to be our largest shareholder concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement we entered into a shareholder agreement and the registration rights agreement with new omaha which give new omaha certain rights under the shareholder agreement new omaha may designate a director to serve on our board of directors in accordance with the terms thereof until the aggregate ownership percentage of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock held by new omaha and its affiliate transferees first falls below 5 the shareholder agreement will terminate when the aggregate ownership percentage of our outstanding shares held by new omaha and certain of its affiliates falls below 3 although there are various restrictions on new omaha’s ability to take certain actions with respect to us and our shareholders including certain standstill provisions for so long as new omaha’s aggregate ownership percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock remains at or above 5 new omaha may seek to influence and may be able to influence us through its appointment of a director to our board of directors and its share ownership

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows   



overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve over 12000  clients worldwide including banks credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies billers retailers and merchants the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five  years and high renewal rates most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services internet and mobile banking software and services accounttoaccount transfers persontoperson payment services debit and credit card processing and services payments infrastructure services and other electronic payments software and services our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides financial institutions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions corporate and other primarily consists of intercompany eliminations amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance such as gains on sales of businesses and associated transition services 

on february 21 2018 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock the additional shares were distributed on march 19 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 5 2018 our common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on march 20 2018 all share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a splitadjusted basis 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy we expect to acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need such as a product service or technology that helps meet client demand an opportunity to change industry dynamics a way to achieve business scale or similar considerations we expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market product or financial strategies 

on january 16 2019 we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire first data in an allstock transaction for an equity value of approximately 22 billion as of the announcement the transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions regulatory approvals and shareholder approval for both companies first data is a global leader in commerceenabling technology and solutions for merchants financial institutions and card issuers   

on october 31 2018 we acquired the debit card processing atm managed services and money pass ®  surchargefree network of elan financial services a unit of us bancorp for approximately 660 million including estimated postclosing working capital adjustments contingent consideration related to earnout provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of fair value this acquisition included within the payments segment deepens our presence in debit card processing broadens our client reach and scale and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing debit solution clients 

during 2017 we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of 384 million  net of acquired cash along with earnout provisions in january 2017 we completed our acquisition of online banking solutions inc “obs” a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions in july 2017 we acquired the assets of pclender llc “pclender” a leader in internetbased mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions the obs and pclender acquisitions are included in the financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and will enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers in august 2017 we acquired dovetail group limited “dovetail” a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions in september 2017 we completed our acquisition of monitise plc “monitise” a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide the dovetail and monitise acquisitions are included in the payments segment and are expected to further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership respectively 

in 2016 we acquired the convenience pay services business of hewlett packard enterprise company and completed our purchase of the community financial services business of aci worldwide inc for an aggregate purchase price of 265 million  these acquisitions expand our biller solution offerings and enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions and are included in the payments segment 

in march 2018 we sold a 55 interest of our lending solutions business which was reported within the financial segment retaining 45 ownership interests in two joint ventures the “lending joint ventures” in conjunction with this transaction we entered into transition services agreements to provide at fair value various administration business process outsourcing technical and data center related services for defined periods to the lending joint ventures we received gross sale proceeds of 419 million from the transactions in addition in january 2018 we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of monitise for proceeds of £37 million   50 million  and in may 2017 we sold our australian item processing business which was reported within the financial segment for approximately 17 million  

during 2017 stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest and account for under the equity method recognized a net gain on the sale of a business and in 2016 recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest our pretax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 26 million  in 2017 and 146 million  in 2016 with related tax expenses of 9 million  and 54 million  respectively in addition we received cash dividends of 2 million  45 million  and 151 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively from stoneriver which were funded from the sale transactions 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to move money and information in a way that moves the world these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2019  are to i continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and iii deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients we also expect to devote significant resources to completing the first data merger and subject to closing to integrating first data into our operations 

industry trends 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment deposit risk management lending and investment products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time the evolving regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions for example legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and may continue to generate new regulations impacting the financial industry these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

the focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated these fees can vary from period to period our revenue is diversified and we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model with our 50 largest financial institution clients 

representing less than 25 of our annual revenue our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs furthermore we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2018  determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the delivery of processing service and product solutions revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may be at a point in time or over time as a practical expedient we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less contracts with customers are evaluated on a contractbycontract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below 

processing and services 

processing and services revenue is generated from account and transactionbased fees for data processing transaction processing electronic billing and payment services electronic funds transfer and debit processing services consulting and professional services and software maintenance for ongoing client support 

we recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and if needed basis a standready obligation and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining tierbased price per unit based on volume of service however pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis 

product 

product revenue is generated from integrated print and card production sales as well as software license sales for software license agreements that are distinct we recognize software license revenue upon delivery assuming a contract is deemed to exist revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended such as labor hours to measure progress towards completion for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 

significant judgments 

we use the following methods inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize for multielement arrangements we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer if these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers 

the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained we include an estimate of the variable amount as appropriate within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted the transaction price including any discounts is allocated between separate goods and services in a multielement arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service 

contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or when a customer terminates some or all of the existing services provided by us when a contract modification occurs it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for asi a separate contract ii the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract or iii a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract further contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation 

additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included within note 2  to the consolidated financial statements

income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

our share of net income from the lending joint ventures and stoneriver is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates of 10 million  in 2018 was primarily comprised of our share of earnings from the lending joint ventures during 2017 stoneriver recognized a net gain on the sale of a business and in 2016 recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest resulting in our share of stoneriver income of 32 million  and 147 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations along with our cash and cash equivalents of 415 million  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 850 million  at december 31 2018  see below under “first data acquisition financing” for a description of our planned financing to fund the first data acquisition the following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 



our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 155 billion  in 2018  an increase  of 5  compared to 148 billion  in 2017  this increase  was primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by an approximate 30 million impact of accounts receivable timing other working capital fluctuations including a 23 million tax payment resulting from new guidance issued by the internal revenue service regarding the tax act and 43 million  of lower cash dividends received from stoneriver the dividends received in 2018 and 2017 represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities 

our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures for share repurchases after the closing of the first data acquisition and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 6  and 5  of our total revenue in 2018  and 2017  respectively

on february 15 2019 we entered into a new term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions have committed to provide us with a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 50 billion consisting of 15 billion in commitments to provide loans with a threeyear maturity and 35 billion in commitments to provide loans with a fiveyear maturity the aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the term loan credit agreement have replaced a corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the bridge facility in accordance with the terms of the bridge facility commitment letter as a result there are now 120 billion in bridge facility commitments remaining we expect to replace these remaining commitments with permanent financing in the form of the issuance of debt securities prior to the closing of the merger 

the availability of loans under the term loan facility is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions that are substantially consistent with the conditions to the funding of the bridge facility including i the closing of the merger substantially concurrently with the funding of such loans ii the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to first data since january 16 2019 iii the truth and accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties iv the receipt of certain certificates and v the receipt of certain financial statements loans drawn under the term loan facility will be subject to amortization at an annual rate of 5 for the first two years and 75 thereafter with loans outstanding under the fiveyear tranche subject to amortization at an annual rate of 10 after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of amortization with accrued and unpaid amortization amounts required to be paid on the last business day in december of each year borrowings under the term loan facility will bear interest at variable rates based on libor or on a base rate plus in each case a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time we are also required to pay a ticking fee that will accrue on the aggregate undrawn commitments under the term loan facility at a per annum rate based upon our long

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2018  we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities such credit ratings were both affirmed in connection with our definitive merger agreement to acquire first data

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2018  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2019  by approximately 11 million  

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity during 2018  the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated 13 billion  a 1 increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 

202 million  as of december 31 2018  to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2018  approximately 6  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2018  there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

government regulation 

the regulations that apply to the delivery of financial services are complex and evolve continuously except with respect to certain products and services fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations may require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us such as those related to security and privacy and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their auditors 

in conducting our directtoconsumer businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services we are directly subject to various federal and state laws rules and regulations including those relating to the movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with licensing and reporting requirements to implement operating policies and procedures necessary to comply with antimoney laundering laws to comply with capital requirements to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” there have been substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and in some cases limited revenue sources for us and our clients among other things the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us in addition federal and state agencies have begun to propose and enact cybersecurity regulations such as the cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies issued by the new york state department of financial services in 2017 and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards proposed by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation in 2016 new regulations could among other things require us to make significant additional investments to comply with them modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided or limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new wellfunded competitors and new technologies including large technology media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry startups and international providers of similar products and services to ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and increasing client expectations our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these demands or achieve market acceptance in addition the success of certain of our products and services rely in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to promote the use of our products and services by their customers if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance or if third parties insufficiently promote our products and services it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services if we are 

not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

mergers consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients or vendors these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could be caused by our actions or the actions of third parties and could involve networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the united states have been adopted including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to and conducts direct examinations of “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us in addition federal and state governments have adopted or are pursuing numerous additional regulations impacting the financial services industry including regulations related to cybersecurity and data privacy to the extent this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results 

of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions additional regulation examination and oversight of us could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations or limit our ability to update our existing products and services or require us to develop new ones any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

if we fail to comply with regulations applicable to our business including data privacy regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations including the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the card association and network rules that we do not successfully address could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available 

misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses 

new guidance or further analysis of the newly enacted us tax reform legislation could cause us to modify current estimates about the impact that it will have on us which could negatively impact our anticipated earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act significantly revises the us corporate income tax code by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorialstyle tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries with the enactment of the tax act our financial results for 2017 included a reduction of income tax expense of approximately 275 million  resulting primarily from the reevaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21 percent  us federal corporate tax rate and the deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings these estimates are based on our initial analysis of the tax act further analysis of this complex legislation or future guidance from the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 73  of our total assets at december 31 2017  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 49 billion  of debt we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2017  we operated data development item processing and support centers in approximately 105 cities we owned five buildings and the more than 120 remaining locations where we operated our businesses are subject to leases we believe that the facilities and equipment that we own and lease are well maintained are in good operating condition and are adequate for our business needs however we may choose to combine existing operations to enhance business integration we maintain our own and contract with multiple service providers to provide processing backup in the event of a disaster we also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we or our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us in the opinion of management the liabilities if any which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows   



overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve over 12000  clients worldwide including banks savings banks credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies billers retailers merchants and building societies the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five  years and high renewal rates most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services internet and mobile banking software and services accounttoaccount transfers persontoperson payment services debit and credit card processing and services payments infrastructure services and other electronic payments software and services our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks credit unions and leasing and finance companies with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions corporate and other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including sharebased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy we expect to acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need such as a product service or technology that helps meet client demand an opportunity to change industry dynamics a way to achieve business scale or similar considerations we expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market product or financial strategies 

during 2017 we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of 384 million  net of 33 million  of acquired cash along with earnout provisions estimated at a fair value of 15 million  in january 2017 we completed our acquisition of online banking solutions inc “obs” a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions in july 2017 we acquired the assets of pclender llc “pclender” a leader in internetbased mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions the obs and pclender acquisitions are included in the financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and will enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers in august 2017 we acquired dovetail group limited “dovetail” a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions in september 2017 we completed our acquisition of monitise plc “monitise” a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide the dovetail and monitise acquisitions are included in the payments segment and will further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership respectively 

in 2016 we acquired the convenience pay services business of hewlett packard enterprise company and completed our purchase of the community financial services business of aci worldwide inc for an aggregate purchase price of 265 million  these acquisitions expand our biller solution offerings and enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions and are included in the payments segment 

in may 2017 we sold our australian item processing business which was reported within the financial segment for approximately 17 million  and in january 2018 we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of monitise for proceeds of £37 million   50 million  in addition in february 2018 we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55 interest of our lending solutions business which is reported within the financial segment retaining a 45 interest in the joint venture 

during 2017 and 2015 stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest and account for under the equity method recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2016 recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest our pretax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 26 million  in 2017  146 million  in 2016  and 29 million  in 2015  with related tax expenses of 9 million  54 million  and 13 million  respectively in addition we received cash dividends of 45 million  151 million  and 36 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively from stoneriver which were funded from the sale transactions 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2018  are i to continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients 

industry trends 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions for example legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and may continue to generate new regulations impacting the financial industry these conditions along with mild economic improvement have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

this increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us based on these market conditions we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth furthermore we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system or elects to move to one of our systems and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions 

that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2017  determined that our goodwill was not impaired the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values except for recently acquired reporting units that approximated or exceeded the carrying values to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition dates and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five  years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions at times however judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables due to the quantity size and nature of our multiple element arrangements the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

revenue in our payments segment increased   144 million  or 5  in 2017  and increased   228 million  or 8  in 2016  compared to the prior years revenue growth at our card services business contributed approximately 25 in each of 2017 and 2016 to the payments segment revenue growth largely due to increased transaction volumes increased volumes also drove revenue growth contributions of 1 in 2017 from our electronic payments business and 2 in 2016 from our output solutions business which included a higher level of emv chip card manufacturing and personalization compared to the prior years revenue from inyear business acquisitions further contributed 22 million or 1 and 86 million or 3 in 2017 and 2016 respectively to payments segment revenue growth 

revenue in our financial segment increased   53 million  or 2  in 2017  and increased   34 million  or 1  in 2016  compared to the prior years our lending solutions business contributed approximately 2 and 1 to the financial segment revenue growth in 2017 and 2016 respectively driven by increased volumes in addition our account processing business contributed approximately 1 to the financial segment revenue growth in 2016 financial segment revenue growth was partially offset by the australian item processing business disposition in 2017 and lower revenue in our international business in 2016 which each negatively impacted financial segment revenue growth by approximately 1 compared to the prior years 

total expenses 

total expenses increased   104 million  in 2017  and 117 million  in 2016  or 3  in each year compared to the prior years total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 731  738  and 751  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively total expenses were favorably impacted by 20 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the gain on the sale of our australian item processing business

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in 2017  and 2016  at 849  and decreased from 867  in 2015  cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 202  200  and 197  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions 

operating income and operating margin

operating income in our financial segment increased   26 million  or 3  in 2017  and was generally consistent in 2016  compared to the prior years operating margin was 335  332  and 338  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively increasing 30  basis points in 2017  and decreasing 60  basis points in 2016  financial segment operating margin in 2017 was positively impacted by approximately 70 basis points from scalable revenue growth increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovationbased solutions negatively impacted financial operating margin by 30 basis points and 60 basis points in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

the operating loss in corporate and other increased   30 million  in 2017  and decreased   34 million  in 2016  compared to the prior years the operating loss increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to increased acquisition and related integration costs of 12 million and increased employee benefit expenses including severance of 20 million these increased costs were partially offset by a 10 million gain on the sale of our australian item processing business the operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisitionrelated intangible assets compared to 2015 

interest expense 

interest expense increased   13 million  or 8  in 2017  and decreased   7 million  or 4  in 2016  compared to the prior years higher average variable interest rates and higher average outstanding debt contributed approximately 7 million and 6 million respectively to increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 the lower interest expense in 2016 was primarily due to the reclassification of 7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2015 

interest and investment income loss net 

the net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a noncash writeoff of a 7 million costmethod investment 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in may 2015 we redeemed our 600 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due in 2016 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 68 senior notes due in 2017 which resulted in a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 85 million related to makewhole payments and other costs associated with redemption 

income tax provision 

income tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 116  386  and 357  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the rate in 2017 decreased by 203  attributable to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act as further described below and by 36  attributable to excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation awards recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision as a result of the 2017 adoption of accounting standards update 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  the higher rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on sales transactions by our unconsolidated affiliate stoneriver 

on december 22 2017  the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act makes broad changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent  to 21 percent  beginning in 2018 2 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 requiring us federal taxable income to include certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations and 5 creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense the provisions of the tax act decreased our 2017 effective tax rate by 203  primarily due to the reevaluation of the net deferred tax liability to reflect the lower federal tax rate of 21 percent  the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from the reported amounts due to changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as guidance that may be issued in the future 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

during 2017 and 2015 stoneriver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2016 recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest resulting in our share of stoneriver income of 32 million  147 million  and 32 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations in 2017 included a litigation settlement related to a prior disposition of 19 million  net of income tax of 7 million  and earnings related to an acquired business held for sale 

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 571  415  and 299  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted by discrete income tax benefits associated with the tax act of 128  per share in 2017 and from our share of net investment gains primarily from stoneriver capital transactions of 009  039  and 007 per share in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2017  and 2016  by merger and integration costs of 023  and 017  per share respectively and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of 025 per share the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 049  046  and 053 per share in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations along with our cash and cash equivalents of 325 million  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 09 billion  at december 31 2017  the following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 



our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 148 billion  in 2017  an increase  of 4  compared to 143 billion  in 2016  this increase  was primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by 106 million  of lower cash dividends received from our stoneriver joint venture and unfavorable timing of payables in 2017  and 2016  we received cash dividends of 45 million  and 151 million  respectively from our stoneriver joint venture these dividends in their entirety represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities 

our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 5  of our total revenue in both 2017  and 2016  

share repurchases 

we purchased 117 billion  and 120 billion of our common stock in 2017  and 2016  respectively on november 16 2016 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 150 million shares of our common stock  as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 107 million  shares remaining under this authorization shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we completed four acquisitions in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of 384 million  net of 33 million  of acquired cash and two acquisitions in 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of 265 million  we funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility 

in january 2018 we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of monitise for proceeds of £37 million   50 million  in addition in february 2018 we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55 interest of our lending solutions business retaining a 45 interest in the joint venture 

indebtedness 



at december 31 2017  our debt consisted primarily of 33 billion  of senior notes 11 billion  of revolving credit facility borrowings and 540 million  of term loan borrowings interest on our senior notes is paid semiannually we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2017  additional information about our debt structure and associated instruments is included in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

variable rate debt 

we maintain a 20 billion  revolving credit agreement and a term loan with a syndicate of banks both the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the variable interest rate was 259  on the revolving credit facility borrowings and 282  on the term loan borrowings at december 31 2017  there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements on the revolving credit facility which matures in april 2020 the outstanding principal balance on the term loan of 540 million  is due at maturity in october 2018 at december 31 2017 the term loan was classified in the consolidated balance sheet as longterm as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a longterm basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and the term loan contain various substantially similar restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2017  we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on our senior notes revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing the following table details our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2017  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2018  by approximately 16 million  

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity during 2017  the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated 12 billion  a 1 increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 150 million  as of december 31 2017  to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2017  approximately 5  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2017  there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives outside the us our primary competitors include global and local it product and services companies as well as payment service providers and processors furthermore we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality security service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories additional information about competition in our segments is provided below

products and services in addition many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products certain existing and potential financial institution clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems in addition we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including computer services inc dh corporation fis infosys ltd international business machines corporation jack henry oracle corporation sap se and temenos group ag 

government regulation 

the regulations that apply to the delivery of financial services are complex and evolve continuously fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us such as those related to security and privacy and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their auditors 

in conducting our directtoconsumer businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services we are directly subject to various federal and state laws rules and regulations including those relating to the movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with licensing and reporting requirements to implement operating policies and procedures necessary to comply with antimoney laundering laws to comply with capital requirements to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” there have been substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and in some cases limited revenue sources for us and our clients among other things the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks in addition federal and state agencies have recently begun to propose cybersecurity regulations such as the proposed cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies issued by the new york state department of financial services in september 2016 and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation in october 2016 new regulations could among other things require us to make significant additional investments to comply with them modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided or limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate 

employees 

we have approximately 23000 employees globally many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry as well as employees with direct experience in payments financial institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing a potential acquisition candidate we emphasize the quality and stability of the acquisition candidate’s employees

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities we also expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new wellfunded competitors and new technologies including large technology media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry startups and international providers of similar products and services to ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in addition we may face challenges meeting local political regulatory business and economic conditions as we grow internationally particularly in emerging market economies and we may find it difficult to manage and oversee operations far from our headquarters in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services the success of our electronic commerce businesses also relies in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to market our services to their customers if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services if we are 

not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or data or the systems or data of our clients or vendors these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could be caused by the failure of third party networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry including the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

since the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” there have been substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the united states including the establishment of a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the doddfrank act the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term in addition federal and state agencies are pursuing additional cybersecurity regulations and are expected to continue to seek to impact client contract terms with service providers like us if government agencies including the cfpb adopt additional rules and exercise supervisory authority over service providers like us we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal and state oversight than in the past which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry require us to make compliance investments andor limit our fees or other revenue sources to the extent these regulations negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions we are subject to contractual requirements imposed by the financial institutions with respect to a number of state and federal regulations including privacy laws and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities also regulators are signaling interest in enforcing regulations directly against service providers to financial institutions and any such direct enforcement could result in increased operating costs for us and additional restrictions on our business processes if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations including the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the card association and network rules that we do not successfully address could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to 

clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require 

sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 74  of our total assets at december 31 2016  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 46 billion  of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we or our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us in the opinion of management the liabilities if any which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows   



overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve over 12000  clients worldwide including banks thrifts credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies retailers merchants mutual savings banks and building societies the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five  years and high renewal rates most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services internet and mobile banking software and services persontoperson payment services debit and credit card processing and services and other electronic payments software and services our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks thrifts credit unions and leasing and finance companies with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions corporate and other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including sharebased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance 

during the first quarter of 2016 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 265 million we acquired the convenience pay services business of hewlett packard enterprise company which enables providers to accept electronic payments from their consumers through multiple channels thereby expanding our biller solution offerings we also completed our purchase of the community financial services business of aci worldwide inc further enhancing our suite of digital banking and payments solutions 

during 2016 stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest and account for under the equity method recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest and in 2015 and 2014 recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses our pretax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 146 million  in 2016  29 million  in 2015  and 87 million  in 2014  with related tax expenses of 54 million  13 million  and 36 million  respectively in addition we received cash dividends of 151 million  36 million  and 110 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively from stoneriver which were funded from the sale transactions 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2017 are i to continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients 

industry trends 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions for example legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and may continue to generate new regulations impacting the financial industry these conditions along with mild economic improvement have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

this increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial 

institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us based on these market conditions we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth furthermore we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system or elects to move to one of our systems and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent 

to which a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2016  determined that our goodwill was not impaired the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values except for a single reporting unit that exceeded the carrying value to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition date and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five  years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions at times however judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables due to the quantity size and nature of our multiple element arrangements the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

financial results 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 







 total revenue 

total revenue increased   251 million  or 5  in 2016  and increased   188 million  or 4  in 2015  compared to the prior years the increase in total revenue during 2016  was due to 8  revenue growth in our payments segment and 1  revenue growth in our financial segment as compared to 2015  the increase in total revenue during 2015  was attributable to 4  revenue growth in our payments segment and 3  revenue growth in our financial segment as compared to 2014  

revenue in our payments segment increased   228 million  or 8  in 2016  and increased   115 million  or 4  in 2015  compared to the prior years payments segment revenue growth during 2016  and 2015  was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased   175 million  or 8  and increased   129 million  or 6  respectively over the prior years the growth in both years was primarily due to new client additions and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services electronic payments and digital channels businesses as well as our biller solutions business in 2015 in 2016 payments segment revenue growth was positively impacted by revenue from acquired businesses totaling 86 million and an increase in product revenue of 53 million  or 8  compared to 2015 primarily due to increased volumes in our output solutions business including a higher level of card manufacturing and personalization the revenue growth in 2015 was partially offset by lower software license revenue as compared to 2014 

revenue in our financial segment increased   34 million  or 1  in 2016  and increased   76 million  or 3  in 2015  compared to the prior years in both 2016 and 2015 financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses including higher contract termination fee revenue in 2015 as compared to the prior years this growth was partially offset by lower revenue in our international business in 2016 and by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points in 2015 

total expenses 

total expenses increased   117 million  or 3  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   87 million  or 2  in 2015  compared to 2014  total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 738  751  and 761  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased  to 478  in 2016  compared to 494  in 2015  and 513  in 2014  cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2016 and 2015 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2016 was also favorably impacted by lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 849  in 2016  compared to 867  in 2015  and 847  in 2014  cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was favorably impacted in 2016 by an increase in highermargin software license revenue and negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 200  197  and 192  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to acquisition and related integration costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased sharebased compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income increased   134 million  or 10  in 2016  and increased   101 million  or 8  in 2015  compared to the prior years total operating margin increased  to 262  in 2016  from 249  in 2015  and 239  in 2014  operating income and operating margin improvements in 2016 and 2015 were driven by revenue growth and operational effectiveness initiatives 

operating income in our payments segment increased   103 million  or 12  and increased   72 million  or 9  in 2016  and 2015  respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 305  293  and 280  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively improving 120  basis points in 2016  and 130  basis points in 2015  the increases in operating income and operating margin in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses along with increased volumes and product mix in our output solutions business in 2016 payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset in 2016 by the dilutive margin impact from acquisitions and in 2015 by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses along with a decrease in highermargin software license revenue compared to the prior year 

operating income in our financial segment was generally consistent in 2016  and increased   53 million  or 7  in 2015  compared to the prior years operating margins were 332  338  and 326  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively decreasing 60  basis points in 2016  and improving 120  basis points in 2015  operating income and operating margin in 2016 were negatively impacted by product mix lower international revenue and increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovationbased solutions operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in 2015 by revenue growth including higher contract termination fee revenue along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses 

the operating loss in corporate and other decreased   34 million  in 2016  and increased   24 million  in 2015  compared to the prior years the operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisitionrelated intangible assets partially offset by acquisition and related integration costs including a 10 million  noncash impairment charge associated with the decision to replace existing software with an acquired solution the operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities as compared to the prior year 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased   7 million  in 2016  and increased   6 million  in 2015  compared to the prior years the higher interest expense in 2015 was primarily due to the reclassification of 7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt 

interest and investment loss income 

the net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a noncash writeoff of a 7 million costmethod investment 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in may 2015 we redeemed our 600 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due in 2016 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 68 senior notes due in 2017 which resulted in a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 85 million related to makewhole payments and other costs associated with redemption 

income tax provision 

income tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 386  in 2016  357  in 2015  and 366  in 2014  the higher rate in 2016 and lower rate in 2015 compared to the prior years were primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales by our unconsolidated affiliate stoneriver of a business interest in 2016 and subsidiary businesses in 2015 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our share of the income of stoneriver was 147 million  32 million  and 91 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively during 2016 stoneriver recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest and in 2015 and 2014 recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses our pretax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 146 million  in 2016  29 million  in 2015  and 87 million  in 2014  

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 415  in 2016  and 299  in both 2015  and 2014  net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net investments gains primarily from stoneriver capital transactions of 039  007  and 020 per share in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and was negatively impacted in 2016 by merger and integration costs of 017  per share and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of 025  per share the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 046  053  and 052 per share in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations along with our cash and cash equivalents of 300 million  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 14 billion  at december 31 2016  the following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 



our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 143 billion  in 2016  an increase  of 6  compared with 135 billion  in 2015  this increase  was primarily due to improved operating results and an increase in cash dividends 

received from our stoneriver joint venture partially offset by lower cash inflow from net working capital changes primarily related to timing of receivable collections 

our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 5  and 7  of our total revenue in 2016  and 2015  respectively capital expenditures in 2015 include 70 million related to our atlanta facility consolidation consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment of which 25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other 

in 2016  and 2015  we received cash dividends of 151 million  and 36 million  respectively from our stoneriver joint venture these dividends in their entirety represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities in addition we acquired the convenience pay services business of hewlett packard enterprise company and the community financial services business of aci worldwide inc for an aggregate purchase price of 265 million during 2016 we funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility

indebtedness 



at december 31 2016  our longterm debt consisted primarily of 33 billion  of senior notes 647 million  of revolving credit facility borrowings and 629 million  of term loan borrowings we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2016  

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that matures in april 2020 borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 181  at december 31 2016  there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended

we maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in october 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 202  at december 31 2016  a scheduled principal payment of 90 million  is 

due on december 31 2017 with the outstanding principal balance of 540 million  due at maturity the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above 

senior notes 

in may 2015 we completed an offering of 175 billion  of senior notes comprised of 850 million  aggregate principal amount of 27  senior notes due in june 2020 and 900 million  aggregate principal amount of 385  senior notes due in june 2025 the notes pay interest at the stated rates semiannually on june 1 and december 1 which commenced on december 1 2015 our 4625  senior notes due in october 2020 and 35  senior notes due in october 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on april 1 and october 1 of each year our 475  senior notes due in june 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on june 15 and december 15 of each year the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade the indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that among other matters limit i our ability to consolidate or merge into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person ii our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens and iii our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions in october 2015 we used our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility to repay the 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes 

in may 2015 we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our 600 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due in june 2016 and 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 68  senior notes due in november 2017 we recorded a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 85 million  related to makewhole payments and other costs associated with this redemption in addition we paid scheduled december 2015 and december 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling 180 million  and repaid at that time outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2016  we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on our senior notes revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing the following table details our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2016  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2017  by approximately 13 million  

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into shortterm highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity during 2016  the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated 12 billion  a 1 increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 86 million  as of december 31 2016  to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2016  approximately 5  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2016  there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives outside the us we see increasing competition by the largest banks governments telecommunications providers and other providers with significant resources furthermore we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality security service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories additional information about competition in our segments is provided below 

payments 

we compete with a number of competitors in our bill payment digital channels card services and biller businesses including aci worldwide inc fidelity national information services inc “fis” first data corporation jack henry and associates inc “jack henry” mastercard incorporated ncr corporation q2 inc total system services incvantiv inc visa inc and the western union company in addition to traditional payments competitors large technology media and other providers are increasingly seeking to provide or facilitate a wide range of point of sale and nonpoint of sale payments these newer 

competitors include but are not limited to alphabet inc amazoncom inc apple inc facebook inc intuit inc paypal holdings inc samsung group starbucks corporation and walmart stores inc certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems instead of our products and services in addition many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products certain existing and potential financial institution clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems in addition we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including computer services inc dh corporation fis infosys ltd international business machines corporation jack henry oracle corporation sap se and temenos group ag 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us such as those related to security and privacy and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors 

in conducting our directtoconsumer businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services we are directly subject to various federal and state laws rules and regulations including those relating to the movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with licensing and reporting requirements to implement operating policies and procedures necessary to comply with antimoney laundering laws to comply with capital requirements to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices and require significant rulemaking the doddfrank act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and in some cases limited revenue sources for us and our clients the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks the cfpb has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments andor limit our fees or other revenue sources we do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the doddfrank act the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities we also expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new wellfunded competitors and new technologies including large technology media and other companies not historically in the financial services industry startups and international providers of similar products and services to ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients and our ability to grow may be limited 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients to attract new ones and to grow profitably 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in addition we may face challenges meeting local political regulatory business and economic conditions as we grow internationally particularly in emerging market economies and we may find it difficult to manage and oversee operations far from our headquarters in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services the success of our electronic commerce businesses also relies in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to market our services to their customers if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations depend on receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors these events could create costly litigation significant financial liability increased regulatory scrutiny financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us we may not be able to prevent a material event in the future and the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could be caused by the failure of third party networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and 

remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and established among other things a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the doddfrank act requires the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations and the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the doddfrank act the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term if the cfpb adopts additional rules and exercises supervisory authority over service providers like us we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal oversight than in the past which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry require us to make compliance investments andor limit our fees or other revenue sources to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions we are subject to contractual requirements imposed by the financial institutions with respect to a number of state and federal regulations including privacy laws and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities also regulators are signaling interest in enforcing regulations directly against service providers to financial institutions and any such direct enforcement could result in increased operating costs for us and additional restrictions on our business processes if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses including our walkin bill payment online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations including the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the card association and network rules that we do not successfully address could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to 

clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require 

sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 76 of our total assets at december 31 2015  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 43 billion  of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows   

 16 

overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve approximately 13000  clients worldwide including banks thrifts credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies retailers merchants mutual savings banks and building societies the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides debit and credit card processing and services electronic bill payment and presentment services internet and mobile banking software and services persontoperson payment services and other electronic payments software and services our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks thrifts credit unions and leasing and finance companies with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions corporate and other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including sharebased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance 

during 2015 and 2014 stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest and account for under the equity method recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2013 completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 29 million in 2015  87 million in 2014  and 71 million in 2013 with related tax expenses of 13 million 36 million and 17 million respectively in addition we received cash dividends funded from capital transactions from stoneriver of 36 million 110 million and 122 million in 2015  2014  and 2013 respectively 

on january 14 2013 we acquired open solutions inc “open solutions” a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions for a cash purchase price of 55 million and the assumption of approximately 960 million of debt with this acquisition we added dna a realtime open architecture account processing system along with 3300 existing open solutions’ clients this acquisition advanced our gotomarket strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of addon solutions 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2016 are i to continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients 

industry trends 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time regulatory conditions have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions in particular legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry these conditions along with mild economic improvement have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

this increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us based on these market conditions we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth furthermore we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system or elects to move to one of our systems and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a 

reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015  determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements no impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during 2015  

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions at times however judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables due to the quantity size and nature of our multiple element arrangements the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

components of revenue and expenses 

the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income

 total revenue 

total revenue increased   188 million  or 4  in 2015  and increased 252 million  or 5  in 2014  compared to the prior years foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted overall revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points in 2015 the increase  in total revenue during 2015  was due to 4  revenue growth in our payments segment and 3  revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2014  the increase in total revenue during 2014  was attributable to 8  revenue growth in our payments segment and 3  revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2013  

revenue in our payments segment increased   115 million  or 4  in 2015  and increased 195 million  or 8  in 2014  compared to the prior years payments segment revenue growth during 2015  and 2014  was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased   129 million  or 6  and 128 million  or 7  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services bill payment and digital channels businesses as well as our biller solutions business in 2015 product revenue decreased   14 million  or 2  in 2015  and increased   67 million  or 10  in 2014  compared to the prior years the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year while the higher product revenue in 2014 was attributable to increased volumes including a higher level of card reissuances in our output solutions business a portion of which is postage passthrough revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product 

revenue in our financial segment increased   76 million  in 2015  and 58 million  in 2014  or 3  in each year compared to the prior years in both 2015 and 2014 revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses including higher contract termination fee revenue this growth was partially offset by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points and 30 basis points in 2015 and 2014 

respectively along with a revenue decline in our international business in 2014 due to the completion of several client implementations in 2013 

total expenses 

total expenses increased   87 million  or 2  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased   103 million  or 3  in 2014  compared to 2013  total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 751  761  and 780  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was higher in 2013 due primarily to merger and integration expenses attributed to our acquisition of open solutions 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased  to 494  in 2015  compared to 513  in 2014  and 516  in 2013  cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2015  and 2014  by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 867  in 2015  compared to 847  in 2014  and 892  in 2013  cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2014 due to higher merger and integration costs in 2013 resulting from the open solutions acquisition including a 30 million noncash impairment charge related to the replacement of our acumen ®  account processing system with dna an open solutions account processing system 

selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 197  192  and 203  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to increased sharebased compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses including merger and integration costs in 2014 as compared to 2013 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income increased   101 million  or 8  in 2015  and 149 million  or 14  in 2014  compared to the prior years total operating margin increased  to 249  in 2015  from 239  in 2014  and 220  in 2013  operating income and operating margin improvements in 2015 and 2014 were driven by scale efficiencies expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives along with lower merger and integration expenses in corporate and other related to the open solutions acquisition 

operating income in our payments segment increased   72 million  or 9  and increased   66 million  or 9  in 2015  and 2014  respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 293  280  and 275  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively improving 130  basis points in 2015  and 50  basis points in 2014  the increases in operating income and operating margin in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses including card services during 2015 payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses along with a decrease in highermargin software license revenue operating margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by increased postage passthrough costs in our output solutions business which are included in both revenue and expenses 

operating income in our financial segment increased   53 million  or 7  and increased   28 million  or 4  in 2015  and 2014  respectively compared to the prior years operating margin in 2015  improved 120  basis points to 338  as compared to 2014  which improved 40  basis points to 326  from 322  in 2013  operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in both years by revenue growth including higher contract termination fee revenue along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses 

the operating loss in corporate and other increased   24 million  in 2015  and decreased 55 million  in 2014  compared to the prior years primarily due to merger integration and other cost activity the operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities the 2014 decrease in operating loss compared to 2013 was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the open solutions acquisition 

interest expense 

interest expense increased   6 million  or 4  in 2015  compared to 2014  and was consistent in 2014  and 2013  the increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges to interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt a decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in may 2015 we redeemed our 600 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due in 2016 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 68 senior notes due in 2017 which resulted in a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 85 million related to makewhole payments and other costs associated with redemption 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 357  in 2015  366  in 2014  and 365  in 2013  the lower effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses by our unconsolidated affiliate stoneriver the 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at stoneriver 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our share of the income of stoneriver was 32 million  91 million  and 80 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively   during 2015 and 2014 stoneriver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2013 completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 29 million  in 2015  87 million  in 2014  and 71 million in 2013 

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 299  in both 2015  and 2014  and 244  in 2013  net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net transaction gains at stoneriver of 007 per share in 2015 and 020 per share in both 2014 and 2013 and was negatively impacted in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of 025 per share and in 2013 by merger and integration costs of 020 per share incurred due to the acquisition of open solutions the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 053  052  and 051  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations our cash and cash equivalents of 275 million  at december 31 2015  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility the following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 



our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 135 billion  in 2015  an increase of 3  compared with 131 billion  in 2014  this increase was primarily due to increased operating results partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends received from our stoneriver joint venture representing returns on our investment 

our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 7  and 6  of our total revenue in 2015  and 2014  respectively capital expenditures in 2015 include 70 million related to our atlanta facility consolidation consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment of which 25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other 

in 2015  and 2014  we received cash dividends of 36 million  and 110 million  respectively from our stoneriver joint venture these dividends in their entirety represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities in january 2016 we received a 140 million cash dividend from stoneriver funded from the january 2016 sale of a business interest 

on january 20 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement with aci worldwide inc to acquire certain assets of its community financial services business in a transaction valued at 200 million exclusive of related tax benefits this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2016 

share repurchases 

we purchased 147 billion and 116 billion of our common stock in 2015  and 2014 respectively on november 19 2014 and november 18 2015 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 200 million and 150 million shares respectively of our common stock as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 174 million  shares remaining under these authorizations shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 

indebtedness 



at december 31 2015  our longterm debt consisted primarily of 33 billion  of senior notes 628 million  of term loan borrowings and 379 million  of revolving credit facility borrowings we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2015  the december 31 2014 debt balances above have been adjusted on a retrospective basis for the early adoption of accounting standards update no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  accordingly debt issuance costs of 21 million  and 13 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively related to our term loan and senior notes are reported as a direct reduction of the related debt instrument 

revolving credit facility 

in april 2015 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our existing 20 billion  revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from october 2018 to april 2020 the amended and restated credit agreement also provided that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the revolving credit facility were released from their respective guarantees borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 149  at december 31 2015 there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements the amended revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that are substantially similar to those under our previously existing credit agreement and require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended 

term loan 

we maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in october 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 167  at december 31 2015 a remaining scheduled principal payment of 90 million  is due on december 31 2017 with the outstanding principal balance of 540 million  due at maturity the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above in april 2015 we entered into an amendment to our term loan facility to conform certain of its terms to those in the amended and restated credit agreement including providing that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the term loan facility were released from their respective guarantees 

senior notes 

in may 2015 we completed an offering of 175 billion  of senior notes comprised of 850 million  aggregate principal amount of 27  senior notes due in june 2020 and 900 million  aggregate principal amount of 385  senior notes due in june 2025 the notes pay interest at the stated rates semiannually on june 1 and december 1 which commenced on december 1 2015 our 4625  senior notes due in october 2020 and 35  senior notes due in october 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on april 1 and october 1 of each year our 475  senior notes due in june 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on june 15 and december 15 of each year the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade the indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that among other matters limit i our ability to consolidate or merge into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person ii our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens and iii our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions at december 31 2014 our 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due in october 2015 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as longterm as we had the intent to refinance this debt on a longterm basis and the ability to do so under our amended and restated revolving credit facility in october 2015 we used our available borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility to repay the 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes 

in may 2015 we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our 600 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due in june 2016 and 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 68  senior notes due in november 2017 we recorded a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 85 million  related to makewhole payments and other costs associated with this redemption in addition we paid scheduled december 2015 and december 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling 180 million  and repaid at that time outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes 

in april 2015 we provided notice to the trustee under the indenture and supplemental indentures governing our outstanding senior notes that the subsidiary guarantors of the outstanding senior notes were automatically released from all of their obligations under the supplemental indentures and their respective guarantees 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2015  we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s 

investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on our senior notes term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than letters of credit the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2015  



 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2015  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2016  by approximately 10 million  

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients these subscriber funds are invested in shortterm highly liquid investments subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2015  of approximately 11 billion  a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pretax income by approximately 10 million  and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual pretax income would decrease by less than 5 million 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 85 million as of december 31 2015  to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2015  approximately 6  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2015  there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

 servicing the market 

the markets for our account and transaction processing services have specific needs and requirements with strong emphasis placed by clients on flexibility quality comprehensiveness and integration of product lines service reliability timely introduction of new products and features and cost effectiveness we believe that our financial strength and primary focus on the financial services industry enhances our ability to meet these needs and service our clients in addition we believe that our dedication to providing excellent client service and support no matter the size of the client and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients 

product development 

to meet the changing technology needs of our clients we continually develop maintain and enhance our products and systems in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 product development expenditures represented approximately 9 of our total revenue our development and technology centers apply the expertise of multiple teams to design develop and maintain specialized processing systems our account processing systems are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international national regional or local marketspecific financial service environments of our clients in developing our products we use current software development principles such as serviceoriented architecture to create efficiencies and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients 

intellectual property 

we regard our software transaction processing services and related products as proprietary and we utilize a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws internal security practices and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software products and services and we continue where appropriate to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations we believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business 

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies large computer hardware manufacturers and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives outside the us we see increasing competition by the largest banks governments telecommunications providers and other providers with significant resources furthermore we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality security service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories additional information about competition in our segments is provided below 

payments 

we compete with a number of competitors in our bill payment biller and card services businesses including aci worldwide inc fidelity national information services inc “fis” first data corporation jack henry and associates inc “jack henry” mastercard incorporated ncr corporation total system services inc 

  

vantiv inc visa inc and the western union company in addition to traditional payments competitors large technology media and other providers are increasingly seeking to provide or facilitate a wide range of point of sale and nonpoint of sale payments these newer competitors include but are not limited to amazoncom inc apple inc facebook inc google inc intuit inc starbucks corporation and walmart stores inc certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems instead of our products and services in addition many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products certain existing and potential financial institution clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems in addition we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including computer services inc dh corporation fis infosys ltd international business machines corporation jack henry oracle corporation sap se and temenos group ag 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors 

in conducting our directtoconsumer businesses including our walkin bill payment prepaid card services online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to the movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with licensing and reporting requirements to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with antimoney laundering laws to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices and require significant rulemaking the doddfrank act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and in some cases limited revenue sources for us and our clients the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb has issued 

  

guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks the cfpb has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments andor limit our fees or other revenue sources we do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the doddfrank act the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term 

employees 

we have approximately 21000 employees globally many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in payments financial institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing a potential acquisition candidate we emphasize the quality and stability of the acquisition candidate’s employees 

available information 

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the markets for our services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities we also expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new wellfunded competitors and new technologies including technology companies not historically in the financial services industry startups and international providers of similar products and services to ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance if we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by a combination of factors including speed cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services the success of our electronic commerce businesses also relies in part on financial institutions billers and other third parties to market our services to their customers if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use 

  

of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors these events could create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider in addition as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities could harm our business or cause us to lose clients an operational failure could be caused by the failure of third party networks and systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and established among other things a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the doddfrank act requires the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement 

  

numerous new regulations and the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks although we have not experienced to date a materially adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition due to these changes in the law it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the doddfrank act the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term if the cfpb adopts additional rules and exercises supervisory authority over service providers like us we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal oversight than in the past which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry require us to make compliance investments andor limit our fees or other revenue sources to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions we are subject to contractual requirements imposed by the financial institutions with respect to a number of state and federal regulations including privacy laws and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities also regulators such as the cfpb are increasingly signaling an intent to enforce regulations directly against service providers to financial institutions and any such direct enforcement could result in increased operating costs for us and additional restrictions on our business processes if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain fiserv subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required in connection with such licensure we are required to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses comprised of our walkin bill payment prepaid card services online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be 

  

expensive or impractical or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses in connection with sales of businesses we make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical compliance and sales personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers some of which offer competing transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the card association and network rules could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 77 of our total assets at december 31 2014 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill in addition we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 38 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve approximately 14500 clients worldwide including banks thrifts credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies retailers and merchants the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides debit credit and prepaid card processing and services electronic bill payment and presentment services internet and mobile banking software and services persontoperson payment services and other electronic payments software and services our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks thrifts credit unions and leasing and finance companies with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance 

during 2014 stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest and account for under the equity method recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2013 completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was 87 million in 2014 and 71 million in 2013 with related tax expenses of 36 million and 17 million respectively in addition we received cash dividends funded from capital transactions from stoneriver of 110 million and 122 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

on november 20 2013 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock the additional shares were distributed on december 16 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 2 2013 our common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 17 2013 all share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a splitadjusted basis 

on january 14 2013 we acquired open solutions inc “open solutions” a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions for a cash purchase price of 55 million and the assumption of approximately 960 million of debt with this acquisition we added dna a realtime open architecture account processing system along with 3300 existing open solutions’ clients this acquisition advanced our gotomarket strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of addon solutions 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and 

  

differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2015 are i to continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings goals ii to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients 

industry trends 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers at the same time regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions in particular legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry these conditions along with mild economic improvement have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet mobile and tablet banking sometimes referred to as “digital channels” 

this increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through digital channels will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us based on these market conditions we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth in addition we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

in addition to the trends described above the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions rather than reducing the overall market these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system or elects to move to one of our systems and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing among other things new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2014 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values 

  

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements no impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during 2014 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions at times however judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables due to the quantity size and nature of our multiple element arrangements the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

 

  

 

 

   

  

 

 

 total revenue 

total revenue increased 252 million or 5 in 2014 and increased 378 million or 9 in 2013 compared to the prior years the increase in total revenue during 2014 was due to 8 revenue growth in our payments segment and 3 revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2013 the increase in total revenue during 2013 was attributable to 13 revenue growth in our financial segment due primarily to the acquisition of open solutions and 4 revenue growth in our payments segment in each case as compared to 2012 the open solutions acquisition contributed 270 million to revenue in 2013 

revenue in our payments segment increased 195 million or 8 in 2014 and increased 109 million or 4 in 2013 compared to the prior years payments segment revenue growth during 2014 and 2013 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased 128 million or 7 and 114 million or 6 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services bill payment and digital channels businesses as well as our biller solutions business in 2013 higher product revenue from increased volumes in our output solutions business a portion of which is postage passthrough revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product also contributed to overall segment revenue growth in 2014 the positive revenue growth in 2013 was partially offset by lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract 

  

revenue in our financial segment increased 58 million or 3 in 2014 and increased 269 million or 13 in 2013 compared to the prior years in 2014 revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses including higher contract termination fee revenue this growth was partially offset by a revenue decline in our international business due to the completion of several client implementations in the prior year and negative currency fluctuations in the current year financial segment revenue growth in 2013 was driven by the acquisition of open solutions which contributed 270 million in revenue excluding the open solutions acquisition revenue growth in 2013 was flat compared to the prior year primarily due to the migration of an account processing client from our system to its parent company’s account processing system 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 103 million or 3 in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 365 million or 11 in 2013 compared to 2012 total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 761 780 and 764 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in total expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 was due primarily to higher merger and integration expenses attributable to our acquisition of open solutions 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 513 in 2014 compared to 516 in 2013 and 529 in 2012 cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2014 and 2013 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have lowered our cost structure 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 847 in 2014 compared to 892 in 2013 and 812 in 2012 in 2013 cost of product included merger and integration costs resulting from the open solutions acquisition including a 30 million noncash impairment charge related to the replacement of our acumen ® account processing system with dna an open solutions’ account processing system which resulted in an increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2014 cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted by an increase in postage passthrough revenue and expense in our output solutions business 

selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 192 203 and 186 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in both 2014 and 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher acquired intangible amortization and in 2013 merger and integration costs attributable to our acquisition of open solutions selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses including merger and integration costs in 2014 as compared to 2013 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income increased 149 million or 14 in 2014 and 13 million or 1 in 2013 compared to the prior years operating margin increased to 239 in 2014 from 220 in 2013 and decreased in 2013 from 236 in 2012 operating income and margin were positively impacted in 2014 primarily by scale efficiencies operational effectiveness initiatives and lower merger and integration expenses in our corporate and other segment related to the open solutions acquisition the operating margin decline of 160 basis points in 2013 was due to increased operating losses of 125 million in our corporate and other segment which negatively impacted our operating margin by 260 basis points due primarily to acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of 115 million associated with the acquisition of open solutions this negative impact was partially offset by positive margin increases in our payments and financial segments in 2013 

operating income in our payments segment increased 66 million or 9 and 45 million or 7 in 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 280 275 and 269 in 2014 2013 

  

and 2012 respectively and increased 50 basis points in 2014 and 60 basis points in 2013 the increases in operating income were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services and digital channels businesses in 2014 and 2013 as well as our bill payment business in 2014 during 2014 payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased postage passthrough costs in our output solutions business which are included in both revenue and expenses as well as increased expenses associated with investments in our biller solutions business operating margin in 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in highermargin software license revenue along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract 

operating income in our financial segment increased 28 million or 4 and 93 million or 14 in 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to the prior years operating margin in 2014 improved 40 basis points to 326 as compared to 2013 which improved slightly to 322 from 320 in 2012 these improvements in operating income and margin in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness initiatives along with higher contract termination fee revenue in our account processing businesses in 2014 in addition the increase in operating income in 2013 was also attributed to the acquisition of open solutions 

the operating loss in the corporate and other segment decreased 55 million in 2014 and increased 125 million in 2013 compared to the prior years the 2014 decrease in operating loss was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the open solutions acquisition as compared to 2013 the increase in operating loss in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs of 65 million resulting from the open solutions acquisition along with increased amortization expenses of 50 million primarily related to open solutions’ acquired intangible assets 

interest expense 

interest expense was consistent in 2014 and 2013 and decreased 10 million or 6 in 2013 compared to 2012 a decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013 the decrease in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to lower average interest rates partially offset by additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of open solutions 

interest and investment income 

interest and investment income was consistent in 2014 and 2013 and decreased 6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a gain recognized on a sale of an investment in 2012 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 366 in 2014 365 in 2013 and 340 in 2012 the 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at stoneriver a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest the increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to income tax expense associated with our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by stoneriver 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our share of the income of stoneriver was 91 million 80 million and 11 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2014 stoneriver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses and in 2013 completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation our share of the gains and related expenses on these transactions was 87 million in 2014 and 71 million in 2013 

  

loss income from discontinued operations 

loss income from discontinued operations related to club solutions and prior dispositions totaled 2 million and 19 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and included income tax expense of 4 million and 13 million respectively 

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 299 in 2014 compared to 244 in 2013 and 215 in 2012 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted in both 2014 and 2013 by 020 per share from our share of net transaction gains at stoneriver and was negatively impacted in 2013 by merger and integration costs of 020 per share incurred due to the acquisition of open solutions the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 052 051 and 037 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations our cash and cash equivalents of 294 million at december 31 2014 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility the following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 13 billion in 2014 an increase of 26 compared with 10 billion in 2013 this increase was primarily due to increased earnings favorable working capital changes and cash dividends received from our stoneriver joint venture representing returns on our investment working capital was favorably impacted in 2014 by the timing of accrued expenses including client deposits and income taxes and was negatively impacted in 2013 by payments related to merger and integration costs and assumed liabilities resulting from the acquisition of open solutions our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were approximately 6 and 5 of our total revenue in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

in 2014 and 2013 we received cash dividends of 110 million and 122 million respectively from stoneriver the portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment 110 million in 2014 and 6 million in 2013 are reported in cash flows from operating activities in the first quarter of 2013 we acquired open solutions for a cash purchase price of 16 million net of cash acquired along with the assumption of approximately 960 million of debt and sold club solutions for approximately 35 million in cash 

share repurchases

revolving credit facility 

in connection with the term loan financing described above on october 25 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing 20 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that conformed certain of its 

  

provisions to those in the new term loan agreement and extended its maturity to october 25 2018 borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or the bank’s base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time the weighted average variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 115 at december 31 2014 there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2014 we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on our senior notes term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2014 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2015 by approximately 85 million 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients these subscriber funds are invested in shortterm highly liquid investments subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2014 of approximately 10 billion a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pretax income by approximately 10 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual pretax income would decrease by less than 5 million 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 73 million as of december 31 2014 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2014 approximately 6 of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2014 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

 management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework 2013  based on management’s assessment our management believes that as of december 31 2014 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting the report is included below under the heading “report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting” 

 

 our management has evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014 have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2014 we completed the implementation of a billing module within our sap enterprise resource planning “erp” system which further integrated our systems and improved the overall efficiency of our billing and collection processes we implemented this module in phases over the past several years which we believe reduced implementation risk the design and documentation of our internal control processes and procedures related to billing have been appropriately modified to supplement previously existing internal controls over financial reporting as with any new technology this module and the internal controls over financial reporting included in the related processes have been tested for effectiveness prior to and concurrent with the implementation we believe the implementation of the billing module within our erp system has further strengthened the related internal controls due to enhanced automation and integration of processes 

  

based on the evaluation we conducted our management has concluded that there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

the markets we serve 

general 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers 

the growing volume and types of payment transactions and the increased focus on new channels such as internet mobile and tablet banking have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments 

our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and economic challenges that they currently face by providing among other things opportunities to reduce their costs and new sources of revenue 

we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through the internet mobile or tablet devices sometimes referred to as “digital channels” will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth in addition we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

our operations are reported in the payments and industry products “payments” and financial institution services “financial” business segments 

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment provide financial institutions and other companies with the products and services required to process electronic payment transactions and to offer their customers access to financial services through digital channels financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on thirdparty providers for those products and services either on a licensed software or outsourced basis as an increasing number of payment transactions are completed electronically and as our clients’ customers seek the convenience of 24hour digital access to their financial accounts within the payments segment we primarily 

  

provide electronic bill payment and presentment services debit and other cardbased payment products and services internet and mobile banking software and services and other electronic payments software and services including accounttoaccount transfers and persontoperson payments our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services 

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations now license software from third parties or outsource their data processing requirements by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products services capacity and capabilities the licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution and outsourcing data processing operations reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 

our strategy 

our vision is to be a global leader in transactionbased technology solutions our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients we are focused on operating businesses where we have deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness a strong competitive position currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future longterm trusted client relationships which are based on recurring services and transactions differentiated solutions that deliver value to our clients through integration and innovation and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner consistent with this focus we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework

to meet the changing technology needs of our clients we continually develop maintain and enhance our products and systems in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 product development expenditures represented approximately 9 of our total revenue our network of development and technology centers apply the expertise of multiple teams to design develop and maintain specialized processing systems our account processing systems are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international national regional or local marketspecific financial service environments of our clients in developing our products we use current software development principles such as serviceoriented architecture to create efficiencies and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients 

intellectual property 

we regard our software transaction processing services and related products as proprietary and we utilize a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws internal security practices and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets the majority of our patents cover various electronic billing and payment innovations other financial software products or services or aspects of our separately managed accounts services we continue where appropriate to seek and secure patents with respect to our technology we believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business 

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies large computer hardware manufacturers and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives in addition certain existing and potential financial institution clients may have the ability to create their own inhouse systems some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality security service 

  

reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services additional information about competition in our segments is provided below 

payments 

we compete with a number of competitors in our bill payment biller solutions and card services businesses including aci worldwide fidelity national information services inc “fis” first data corporation jack henry and associates inc “jack henry” mastercard incorporated total system services inc visa inc and western union certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems instead of our products and services in addition many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products this competition is intensified by the efforts of vendors and consultants who encourage clients to establish clientoperated data centers and the design and implementation of customized software solutions we also compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fis jack henry and harland financial solutions inc 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by state regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions also state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients auditors and regulators 

in conducting our directtoconsumer electronic commerce business including our walkin bill payment prepaid card services online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with licensing and reporting requirements to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with antimoney laundering laws and protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies introduce more stringent regulatory capital 

  

requirements implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices and require significant rulemaking the doddfrank act also established a new federal interagency council called the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the fsoc monitors and assesses “systemic risk” to the safety of the us financial system and coordinates the actions of the various regulatory agencies on those issues the cfpb is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks the doddfrank act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the fsoc the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term 

employees 

we have approximately 21000 employees globally many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the us are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing a potential acquisition candidate we emphasize the quality and stability of its employees

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services the success of our electronic commerce business also relies in part on contracts with financial institutions billers and other third parties to market our services to their customers these contracts are important to the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use 

  

of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors these events could create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider in addition as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities could harm our business or cause us to lose clients such operational failure could be due to the failure of third party networks and systems we rely on to deliver our services and over which we have limited or no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank act” was signed into law the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and established a new federal interagency council called the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau 

  

“cfpb” the doddfrank act requires the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations and the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the cfpb has defined to include service providers like us to cfpb supervised banks and nonbanks the fsoc is empowered to designate certain financial institutions as well as nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions subject to heightened federal oversight and the cfpb’s rulemaking supervisory and enforcement power related to consumer financial protection laws may extend to service providers for large insured depository institutions or credit unions it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the fsoc the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term if the fsoc designates our company or any of our subsidiaries as a systemically important financial institution or the cfpb adopts additional rules and exercises supervisory authority over service providers like us we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal oversight than in the past which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions we are subject to contractual requirements imposed by the financial institutions with respect to a number of state and federal regulations including privacy laws and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities also regulators such as the cfpb are increasingly signaling an intent to enforce regulations directly against service providers to financial institutions and any such direct enforcement could result in increased operating costs for us and additional restrictions on our business processes if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain fiserv subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments business comprised of our walkin bill payment prepaid card services online bill payment and popmoney persontoperson payment services is subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of 

  

intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in the past several years we sold several significant businesses in connection with these sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on the experience skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees if we fail to attract motivate and retain highly qualified management technical and compliance personnel our future success could be harmed our senior management provides strategic direction for our company and if we lose members of our leadership team our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry applicable regulatory and industry requirements computer systems and software applications and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel we could suffer delays in new product development experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issues and some of those issuers are our competitors with respect to transaction processing services if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our certifications could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes to the card association and network rules could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 77 of our total assets at december 31 2013 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 38 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions

 item 3 legal proceedings

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2014 are i to continue to build highquality revenue growth while meeting our earnings goals ii to extend market momentum deeper into client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients 

industry trends 

market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally in particular legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result these conditions have however created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions including mobile banking and persontoperson payments despite the difficult environment over the past several years our revenue increased 9 to 48 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012 our net income per share from continuing operations increased to 244 in 2013 as compared to 215 in 2012 and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 10 billion in 2013 compared to 826 million in 2012 we believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring feebased revenue model the largely nondiscretionary nature of our products and services and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology solutions to outsourced solutions 

during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system or elects to move to one of our systems and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated 

business developments 

we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments including popmoney for persontoperson payments mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions in january 2013 we acquired open solutions and its dna account processing system we believe our wide range of industryleading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial 

  

statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

acquisitions 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below when reviewing goodwill for impairment we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test when performing a qualitative test we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2013 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements based on our impairment assessments in 2013 we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 

  

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

 total revenue 

total revenue increased 378 million or 9 in 2013 and increased 147 million or 3 in 2012 compared to the prior years the increase in total revenue during 2013 was attributable to 13 revenue growth in our financial segment due primarily to the acquisition of open solutions and 4 revenue growth in our payments segment in each case as compared to 2012 the increase in total revenue during 2012 was primarily due to 5 revenue growth in our payments segment and 2 revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2011 revenue from acquired companies contributed 270 million and 43 million to revenue in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

revenue in our payments segment increased 109 million or 4 in 2013 and increased 110 million or 5 in 2012 compared to the prior years payments segment revenue growth during 2013 and 2012 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased 114 million and 100 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively or 6 each year the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services business and digital channels business which includes our online and mobile banking solutions as well as our biller solutions and bill payment businesses in 2013 in 2012 revenue from acquired companies totaling 40 million and higher postage passthrough revenue which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business positively impacted revenue growth by approximately three percentage points as compared to 2011 the positive 

  

revenue growth in both 2013 and 2012 was partially offset by lower software license revenue along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012 

revenue in our financial segment increased 269 million or 13 in 2013 and increased 36 million or 2 in 2012 compared to the prior years financial segment revenue growth in 2013 was driven by the acquisition of open solutions which contributed 270 million in revenue excluding the open solutions acquisition revenue growth in 2013 was flat compared to the prior year primarily due to the migration of an account processing client from our system to its parent company’s account processing system in 2012 revenue growth in our financial segment was favorably impacted by an increase of 67 million or 4 in processing and services revenue primarily attributed to increased revenue in our account processing and lending businesses partially offset by volume declines in our check processing business in addition financial segment growth was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points in 2012 primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to 2011 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 365 million or 11 in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 89 million or 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 780 764 and 769 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in total expenses and as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 is due primarily to the acquisition of open solutions 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 516 in 2013 compared to 529 in 2012 and 544 in 2011 cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2013 and 2012 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our cost structure 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 892 in 2013 compared to 812 in 2012 and 757 in 2011 the increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs resulting from the open solutions acquisition including a 30 million noncash impairment charge related to the replacement of our acumen ® account processing system with dna an open solutions account processing system the increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in highmargin software license sales as well as an increase in postage passthrough revenue and expenses in our output solutions business as compared to 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 153 million or 19 and 29 million or 4 in 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the prior years selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 203 186 and 185 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 was primarily due to higher acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of 53 million attributable to our acquisition of open solutions 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income increased 13 million or 1 in 2013 and 58 million or 6 in 2012 compared to the prior years operating margin decreased to 220 in 2013 from 236 in 2012 and increased in 2012 from 231 in 2011 the operating margin decline of 160 basis points in 2013 was due to increased operating losses of 125 million in our corporate and other segment which negatively impacted our operating margin by 260 basis points due primarily to acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of 115 million associated with the acquisition of open solutions this negative impact was partially offset by positive margin increases in our payments and financial segments in 2013 the operating margin improvement of 50 basis points in 2012 was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our cost structure 

  

operating income in our payments segment increased 45 million or 7 and 9 million or 1 in 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 275 269 and 278 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and increased 60 basis points in 2013 and decreased 90 basis points in 2012 the increases in operating income were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services business in 2013 and 2012 as well as our digital channels business in 2013 payments segment operating margins were negatively impacted by a decrease in highermargin software license revenue in both years along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012 operating margin in 2012 was also negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development support and integration of new products and services including popmoney for persontoperson payments and mobiliti for mobile banking and payment services 

operating income in our financial segment increased 93 million or 14 and 39 million or 6 in 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the prior years operating margin in 2013 improved slightly to 322 as compared to 2012 which improved to 320 from 306 in 2011 these improvements in operating income and margin in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness benefits partially offset by the migration of an account processing client to its parent company’s account processing system in 2013 and a decrease in highermargin software license revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011 

the operating loss in the corporate and other segment increased 125 million in 2013 and decreased 10 million in 2012 compared to the prior years the increase in operating loss in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs of 65 million resulting from the open solutions acquisition including a 30 million noncash impairment charge related to the replacement of our acumen account processing system with dna an open solutions account processing system in addition amortization expenses increased by 50 million in 2013 primarily related to open solutions acquired intangible assets the decrease in operating loss in 2012 was primarily due to reduced employee severance and merger and integration costs as compared to 2011 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 10 million or 6 and 14 million or 7 in 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the prior years these decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years as a result of our debt refinancing activities the interest expense decrease in 2013 was partially offset by additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of open solutions in 2012 interest expense was negatively impacted by 4 million of expense associated with hedge ineffectiveness recognized upon the settlement of our forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements “forwardstarting swaps” in september of 2012 

interest and investment income 

interest and investment income decreased 6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a gain recognized on a sale of an investment in the prior year period 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in 2011 we issued 10 billion principal amount of senior notes in a public debt offering and used the proceeds to repay our senior notes which matured in november 2012 the premium paid on the early retirement of debt and other costs associated with the transaction resulted in pretax charges of 85 million in 2011 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 365 in 2013 340 in 2012 and 351 in 2011 the increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the income tax expense associated with our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by our unconsolidated affiliate stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” the lower effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives including the associated discrete tax benefits 

  

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our share of the income of stoneriver a joint venture in which we own a 49 interest was 80 million 11 million and 18 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2013 increase in income was due to our 71 million share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by stoneriver 

loss income from discontinued operations 

loss income from discontinued operations related to club solutions and prior dispositions totaled 2 million 19 million and 15 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and included income tax expense benefits of 4 million 13 million and 11 million respectively 

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 244 in 2013 compared to 215 in 2012 and 169 in 2011 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2013 was favorably impacted by 020 per share from our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by stoneriver offset by merger and integration costs of 020 per share incurred due to the acquisition of open solutions net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a loss on early debt extinguishment of 018 per share in 2011 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 051 037 and 034 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations our cash and cash equivalents of 400 million at december 31 2013 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility the following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 1039 million in 2013 an increase of 26 compared with 826 million in 2012 this increase was primarily due to increased earnings favorable working capital changes and a payment of 88 million for the settlement of forwardstarting swaps in 2012 in 2013 our working capital was positively impacted by timing of various cash payments and receipts and overall 

  

lower income tax payments compared to 2012 in addition working capital was negatively impacted in 2012 by an increase in payments for discretionary and incentivebased employee compensation including company 401k profit sharing contributions our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures in 2013 increased by 43 million compared to 2012 and were less than 5 of our total revenue in each year 

in the first quarter of 2013 we acquired open solutions for a cash purchase price of 16 million net of cash acquired and sold club solutions for 35 million in cash in 2013 and 2012 we received cash dividends of 122 million and 55 million respectively from stoneriver the portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment 6 million in 2013 and 23 million in 2012 are reported in cash flows from operating activities 

share repurchases 

we purchased 578 million and 634 million of our common stock in 2013 and 2012 respectively on each of february 22 2012 and august 5 2013 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 185 million shares remaining under this authorization shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans

december 31 2014 with the remaining principal balance of 540 million due in october 2018 the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below 

revolving credit facility 

in connection with the term loan financing described above on october 25 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing 20 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that conformed certain of its provisions to those in the new term loan agreement and extended its maturity to october 25 2018 the revolving credit facility was previously scheduled to expire on august 1 2017 borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or the bank’s base rate plus a specified margin based on our longterm debt rating in effect from time to time there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements as of december 31 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended

interest rate hedge contracts 

to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we maintained forwardstarting swaps designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional value of 550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fiveyear and tenyear fixed rate borrowings upon the issuance of senior notes in september 2012 we paid 88 million included in cash flows from operating activities to settle the forwardstarting swaps and recognized approximately 4 million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness the remaining 84 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes of 33 million and is being recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments in addition we maintained interest rate swap agreements “swaps” that expired in september of 2012 designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional value of 10 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings there were no forwardstarting swaps or swaps outstanding as of december 31 2013 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2013 we had a credit 

  

rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rates payable on our senior notes term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp changes the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than letters of credit the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2013

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency our senior management actively monitors these risks 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients these subscriber funds are invested in shortterm highly liquid investments subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2013 of approximately 10 billion a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pretax income by approximately 10 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual pretax income would decrease by less than 5 million 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt we have also used interest rate hedge contracts we previously maintained interest rate swap agreements with total notional values of 10 billion and forwardstarting swaps with a total notional value of 550 million to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs all interest rate hedge contracts were settled or expired in september 2012 based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2013 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2014 by approximately 9 million 

  

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 53 million to hedge foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee in 2013 approximately 7 of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2013 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting the report is included below under the heading “report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting” 

 

 our management has evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2013 have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2013 we continued to implement a billing module within our sap enterprise resource planning “erp” system which we expect to further integrate our systems and improve the overall efficiency of our billing and collection processes we expect the implementation of this module to continue in phases over the next year which we believe will reduce implementation risk the design and documentation of our internal control processes and procedures related to billing will be appropriately modified to supplement existing internal controls over financial reporting as with any new technology this module and the internal controls over financial reporting included in the related processes will be tested for 

  

effectiveness prior to and concurrent with the implementation we believe the implementation of the billing module within our erp system will further strengthen the related internal controls due to enhanced automation and integration of processes 

based on the evaluation we conducted our management has concluded that there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

 our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and has issued their report as set forth below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of fiserv inc 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of fiserv inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2013 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 of the company and our report dated february 20 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

the markets we serve 

general 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same ultimate customers 

the growing volume and types of payment transactions and the increased focus on new channels such as internet banking and mobile banking have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments 

our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us we also have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue in addition we believe that the products and services that we provide can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and economic challenges that they currently face by providing among other things opportunities to reduce their costs innovative products and services and new sources of revenue 

we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through the internet or mobile devices sometimes referred to as “digital channels” will continue to increase which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth in addition we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients our operations are reported in the payments and industry products “payments” and financial institution services “financial” business segments 

  

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment provide financial institutions and other companies with the products and services required to process electronic payment transactions and to offer their customers access to financial services through digital channels financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on thirdparty providers for those products and services either on a licensed software or outsourced basis as an increasing number of payment transactions are completed electronically and as our clients’ customers seek the convenience of 24hour digital access to their financial accounts within the payments segment we primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services debit and other cardbased payment products and services internet and mobile banking software and services and other electronic payments software and services including accounttoaccount transfers and persontoperson payments our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services 

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations now license software from thirdparties or outsource their data processing requirements by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products services capacity and capabilities the licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution and outsourcing through the utilization of service bureaus or resource management capabilities reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 

our strategy 

our vision is to be a global leader in transactionbased technology solutions our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients we are focused on operating businesses where we have deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness a strong competitive position currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future longterm trusted client relationships which are based on recurring services and transactions differentiated solutions that deliver value to our clients through integration and innovation and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner consistent with this focus we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies 

  

large computer hardware manufacturers and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives in addition certain existing and potential financial institution clients may have the ability to create their own inhouse systems some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services additional information about the markets in which we compete is provided in the segment discussion below 

payments 

fidelity national information services inc “fis” jack henry and associates inc “jack henry” and online resources corporation compete with us most directly in our bill payment business western union is our primary competitor in our billerdirect bill payment and walkin payments businesses a number of other companies compete with us in our cardbased payment transaction processing business including first data corporation total system services inc mastercard incorporated and visa inc certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems instead of our products and services and many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products this competition is intensified by the efforts of vendors and consultants who encourage clients to establish clientoperated data centers and the design and implementation of customized software solutions we also compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fis jack henry and harland financial solutions inc 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by state regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients auditors and regulators 

in addition in conducting our directtoconsumer electronic commerce business including our walkin bill payment prepaid card services online bill payment and popmoney personal payment services we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with annual reporting and licensing requirements to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was enacted the doddfrank act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services 

  

industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices and require significant rulemaking the doddfrank act also established a new federal interagency council called the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” the fsoc monitors and assesses “systemic risk” to the safety of the us financial system and coordinates the actions of the various regulatory agencies on those issues the cfpb is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to and enforcement of federal consumer financial protection laws the doddfrank act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the fsoc the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the us are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing a potential acquisition candidate we emphasize the quality and stability of its employees 

available information 

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry a more troubled or prolonged poor economic 

  

environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

the market for our electronic transaction services continues to evolve and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the success of our electronic commerce business also relies in part on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to market our services to their customers these contracts are important to the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the 

  

opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

many financial institutions are experiencing operating losses including some of our clients in some cases these operating losses have resulted in the failure andor consolidation of financial institutions failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank act” was signed into law the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and establishes a new federal interagency council called the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a new federal bureau called the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which we discuss above under “ item 1 business – government regulation  ” the doddfrank act requires the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations in addition the fsoc is empowered to designate certain financial institutions as well as nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions subject to heightened federal oversight and the cfpb’s rulemaking supervisory and enforcement power related to consumer financial protection laws may extend to service providers for large insured depository institutions or credit unions it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the fsoc the cfpb or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term if the fsoc designates our company or any of our subsidiaries as a systemically important financial institution or the cfpb adopts rules and exercises supervisory authority over service providers like us we could be subject to a greater degree of direct federal oversight than in the past which could slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business our associates our clients and their customers any unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service or similar act by any malevolent party could disrupt the integrity continuity security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors these events could create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause 

  

current or potential clients to choose another service provider although we encounter threats from time to time none of which have materially impacted us and we continue to seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls the impact of a material event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses could harm our business or cause us to lose clients such operational failure could be due to the failure of third party networks and systems we rely on to deliver our services and over which we have limited to no control interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in 

  

every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in the past several years we sold several significant businesses in connection with these sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions we are subject to a number of state and federal regulations including privacy laws and our operations are examined on a regular basis by various state and federal regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

certain fiserv subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us 

  

to file periodic reports in addition our directtoconsumer payments businesses are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 76 of our total assets at december 31 2012 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 32 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve approximately 16000 clients worldwide including banks thrifts credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies retailers merchants and government agencies the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years we also have had high contract renewal rates with our clients the majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are primarily in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment and the financial institution services “financial” segment the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services debit and other cardbased payment products and services internet and mobile banking software and services and other electronic payments software and services including accounttoaccount transfers and persontoperson payments our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 

on january 14 2013 we acquired open solutions inc “open solutions” a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions for a cash purchase price of 55 million we also assumed approximately 960 million of open solutions’ debt in connection with the acquisition this acquisition advances fiserv’s gotomarket strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide a broad array of our addon solutions 

in september 2011 we acquired cashedge inc “cashedge” a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as accounttoaccount transfer account opening and funding data aggregation small business invoicing and payments and persontoperson payments for approximately 460 million net of cash acquired the acquisition of cashedge has advanced our digital payments strategy in the first quarter of 2011 we acquired mobile commerce ltd “mcom” an international mobile banking and payments provider and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 50 million net of cash acquired mcom has enhanced our mobile and payments capabilities and the other acquired companies have added to or enhanced specific products or services that we already provide 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2013 are i to continue to build highquality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments ii to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions and iii to deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients 

  

industry trends 

market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally in addition legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result these conditions have however created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions including mobile banking and persontoperson payments despite the difficult environment over the past several years our revenue increased 3 to 45 billion in 2012 as compared to 2011 our net income per share from continuing operations increased to 434 as compared to 340 in 2011 which included a loss from early debt extinguishment in 2011 of 037 per share and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 835 million we believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring feebased revenue model the largely nondiscretionary nature of our products and services and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse technology solutions to outsourced solutions 

during the past 25 years the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3 per year this decline is primarily a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions although in the past several years was also due to government actions in 2012 the number of government actions continued to decline as compared to 2011 and 2010 although these reductions in the number of financial institutions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients bank failures and forced consolidations have been to some extent offset by a general decline in the number of mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform or elects to move to one of our platforms and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multiyear contract is acquired by another financial institution these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 

business developments 

we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments including popmoney for persontoperson payments mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions we believe our wide range of marketleading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace 

critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

  

acquisitions 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below we have not aggregated any operating segments into reporting units for purposes of conducting goodwill impairment testing when reviewing goodwill for impairment we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or to the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units then we perform a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test the first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2012 determined that our goodwill was not impaired based on the most recent fair value estimates the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements based on our impairment assessments in 2012 we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions additionally given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

components of revenue and expenses 

the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

processing and services 

processing and services revenue which in 2012 represented 83 of our consolidated revenue is primarily generated from account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel equipment and data communication infrastructure costs including costs to maintain software applications client support depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 

product 

product revenue which in 2012 represented 17 of our consolidated revenue is derived from integrated print and card production 13 and software licenses 4 cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following costs of materials and software development personnel infrastructure costs depreciation and amortization and other costs directly associated with product revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel administrative employees and management advertising and promotional costs depreciation and amortization and other selling and administrative expenses 

  

financial results 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

 

  

 

1 percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue expense income or loss amount divided by total revenue except for cost of processing and services and cost of product amounts which are divided by the related component of revenue 

  

  

 

 

 total revenue 

total revenue increased 145 million or 3 in 2012 and increased 204 million or 5 in 2011 compared to the prior years the increase in total revenue during 2012 was primarily due to 5 revenue growth in our payments segment and 2 revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2011 the increase in total revenue during 2011 was primarily due to 8 revenue growth in our payments segment and 3 revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2010 revenue from acquired companies contributed 43 million and 30 million to revenue in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

revenue in our payments segment increased 108 million or 5 in 2012 and increased 173 million or 8 in 2011 compared to the prior years revenue growth in our payments segment during 2012 and 2011 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased 98 million and 99 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively or 6 each year the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services business as well as our digital channels business which includes our mobile banking solution revenue from acquired companies totaled 40 million and 26 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point in the respective periods in addition higher postage passthrough revenue which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business contributed to growth in this segment by approximately one percentage point in 2012 and three percentage points in 2011 the positive growth in 2012 was partially offset by lower revenue in our electronic bill payment business driven primarily by the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution 

  

revenue in our financial segment increased 36 million or 2 in 2012 and increased 53 million or 3 in 2011 compared to the prior years revenue growth in our financial segment was favorably impacted by increases of 67 million or 4 and 42 million or 2 in 2012 and 2011 respectively in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our account processing and lending businesses partially offset by volume declines in our check processing business in addition financial segment growth was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points in 2012 primarily due to lower software license revenue 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 85 million or 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 215 million or 7 in 2011 compared to 2010 total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 764 770 and 756 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 531 in 2012 and increased to 548 in 2011 from 543 in 2010 in 2012 and 2011 cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our overall cost structure in 2011 this positive impact was offset by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 812 in 2012 compared to 757 in 2011 and 742 in 2010 the increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in highmargin software license sales as compared to 2011 the cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in both 2012 and 2011 was also impacted by an increase in postage passthrough revenue and expenses in our output solutions business 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 30 million or 4 and 59 million or 8 in 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the prior years however selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was relatively consistent in 2012 at 185 compared to 184 in 2011 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 was primarily in the corporate and other segment and was due to employee severance and merger and integration expenses 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income increased 60 million or 6 in 2012 and decreased 11 million or 1 in 2011 compared to the prior years operating margin increased to 236 in 2012 from 230 in 2011 and decreased in 2011 from 244 in 2010 the operating margin improvement of 60 basis points in 2012 was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our overall cost structure the operating margin decline of 140 basis points in 2011 was primarily due to increased operating losses in the corporate and other segment primarily attributable to higher employee severance merger and integration costs and amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

operating income in our payments segment increased 12 million or 2 and 31 million or 5 in 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the prior years primarily due to growth and operating leverage in our card services business operating margins were 268 275 and 283 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and decreased 70 basis points in 2012 and 80 basis points in 2011 payments segment operating margins in 2012 and 2011 were negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development support and integration of new products and services including popmoney for persontoperson payments and mobiliti for mobile banking and payment services operating margin was also negatively impacted in 2012 by a decrease in highermargin software license revenue and by lower revenue in our electronic bill payment business driven primarily by the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in addition operating margins in the payments segment in 2012 and 2011 were negatively impacted by increased postage passthrough costs which are included in both revenue and expenses 

  

operating income in our financial segment increased 39 million or 6 and 22 million or 4 in 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins improved in both years and were 320 306 and 303 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these improvements in operating income and operating margin in 2012 were primarily due to improved revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our account processing and lending businesses and operating efficiencies in our item processing businesses partially offset by a decrease in highermargin software license revenue operating margin in 2011 was consistent with 2010 

the operating loss in the corporate and other segment decreased 9 million in 2012 and increased 64 million in 2011 compared to the prior years the changes in operating loss were primarily due to employee severance and merger and integration costs which in total decreased 10 million in 2012 and increased 35 million in 2011 as compared to the respective prior year periods in addition the remaining increase in 2011 was also attributable to higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 14 million or 7 and 10 million or 5 in 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the prior years these decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2012 and 2011 as compared to the prior years as a result of our debt refinancing activities in 2012 interest expense was negatively impacted by 4 million of expense associated with hedge ineffectiveness recognized upon the settlement of our forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements “forwardstarting swaps” in september of 2012 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in 2011 and 2010 we issued 10 billion and 750 million principal amount of senior notes respectively in public debt offerings and used proceeds from the offerings to repay our senior notes which matured in november 2012 the premium paid on the early retirement of debt and other costs associated with the transactions resulted in pretax charges of 85 million in 2011 and 26 million in 2010 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 340 in 2012 351 in 2011 and 380 in 2010 the lower effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives including the associated discrete tax benefits the lower effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of tax audits and changes in state tax laws 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our 49 share of the income of stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” was 11 million 18 million and 14 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2011 the increase in income was primarily due to a 3 million gain representing our share on the sale of a business by stoneriver 

income loss from discontinued operations 

income loss from discontinued operations related to prior dispositions totaled 14 million 19 million and 10 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and included income tax expense benefits of 10 million 13 million and 14 million respectively 

net income per share  diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 434 in 2012 compared to 340 in 2011 and 334 in 2010 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a loss on early debt extinguishment of 037 per share in 2011 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 076 069 and 060 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations our cash and cash equivalents of 358 million at december 31 2012 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow was 835 million in 2012 a decrease of 12 compared with 953 million in 2011 primarily due to a payment of 88 million for the settlement of forwardstarting swaps in the third quarter of 2012 and due to working capital changes in 2012 our working capital was negatively impacted by an increase in payments for discretionary and incentivebased employee compensation including company 401k profit sharing contributions and higher income tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections in 2012 our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures of 195 million in 2012 remained relatively consistent with 2011 expenditures and were less than 5 of our total revenue in each year 

in 2012 and 2011 we received cash dividends of 55 million and 54 million respectively from stoneriver the portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment 23 million in 2012 and 12 million in 2011 are reported in cash flows from operating activities in 2011 we acquired cashedge mcom and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of 511 million net of cash acquired 

share repurchases 

we purchased 634 million 533 million and 413 million of our common stock in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively on february 22 2012 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 56 million shares remaining under this authorization shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 

  

indebtedness 

 

 in september 2012 we issued 700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2022 and used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay a portion of our senior term loan that was due in november 2012 the remaining outstanding amount of the term loan was repaid upon maturity using available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash at december 31 2012 our longterm debt consisted primarily of 295 billion of senior notes and 280 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2012 

the acquisition of open solutions on january 14 2013 for a cash purchase price of 55 million and repayment of assumed debt of 960 million was funded in 2013 utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility 

revolving credit facility 

in august 2012 we entered into a 20 billion amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks replacing our existing 10 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in september 2014 borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate 13 at december 31 2012 there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements the facility expires on august 1 2017 and contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended 

senior notes 

in september 2012 we issued 700 million aggregate principal amount of 35 senior notes due in october 2022 which pay interest semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year commencing on april 1 2013 in june 2011 we issued 10 billion of senior notes comprised of 600 million of 3125 senior notes due in june 2016 and 400 million of 475 senior notes due in june 2021 which pay interest semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year our 3125 senior notes due in october 2015 and our 4625 senior notes due in october 2020 pay interest at the stated rate on april 1 and october 1 of each year our 68 senior notes due in november 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on may 20 and november 20 of each year the interest rates

senior term loan 

our senior term loan matured in november 2012 and was repaid using a combination of proceeds from the september 2012 issuance of senior notes our revolving credit facility and available cash term loan borrowings under this facility bore interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate 

interest rate hedge contracts 

to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we maintained forwardstarting swaps designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional value of 550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fiveyear and tenyear fixed rate borrowings upon the issuance of senior notes in september 2012 we paid 88 million included in cash flows from operating activities to settle the forwardstarting swaps and recognized approximately 4 million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness the remaining 84 million is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes of 33 million and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments in addition we maintained interest rate swap agreements “swaps” designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional value of 10 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings the swaps which expired in september 2012 effectively fixed the interest rate on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weightedaverage rate of approximately 50 prior to financing spreads and related fees there were no swaps outstanding as of december 31 2012 

shelf registration statement 

in 2010 we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock and debt securities or a combination thereof each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2012 we had a credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

  

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to two percent in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed two percent above the original interest rate 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than letters of credit the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2012 

 

  

 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients these subscriber funds are primarily invested in shortterm instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity based on average subscriber funds balances during 2012 of approximately 10 billion a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pretax income by approximately 10 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual pretax income would decrease by less than 5 million 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and previously through the use of interest rate hedge contracts we previously maintained interest rate swap agreements with total notional values of 1 billion and forwardstarting swaps with a total notional value of 550 million to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs all interest rate hedge contracts were settled or expired in september 2012 based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2012 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2013 by less than 5 million 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions in 2012 7 of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2012 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

during the quarter we began to implement a billing module within our sap enterprise resource planning “erp” system which we expect to further integrate our systems and improve the overall efficiency of our billing and collection processes we expect the implementation of this module to continue in phases over the next few years which we believe will reduce implementation risk the design and documentation of our internal control processes and procedures related to billing will be appropriately modified to supplement existing internal controls over financial reporting as with any new technology this module and the internal controls over financial reporting included in the related processes will be tested for effectiveness prior to 

  

and concurrent with the implementation we believe the implementation of the billing module within our erp system will further strengthen the related internal controls due to enhanced automation and integration of processes

the markets we serve 

general 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same ultimate customers 

the growing volume and types of payment transactions and the increased focus on new channels such as internet banking and mobile banking have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions we believe that financial institutions will need to continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure technology products services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments 

the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined steadily at a cumulative annual rate of approximately three percent per year since 1985 despite this consolidation the number of customers and accounts and the amount of deposits serviced by the financial industry as a whole has increased over the same period transaction growth particularly in electronic payment transactions has also continued to increase in addition our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation has had on us we also have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue  in recent years many of our financial institution clients have finalized their spending decisions later in the year as a result we have seen and expect to continue to see a larger percentage of our annual revenue occurring in the second half of the year 

we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions including electronic transactions through the internet or mobile devices sometimes referred to as “digital channels” will continue to increase which should translate to revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth in addition we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients our operations are reported in the payments and industry products “payments” and financial institution services “financial” business segments 

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment provide financial institutions and other companies with the products and services required to process electronic payment transactions and to offer their customers access to financial services through digital channels financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on thirdparty providers for those products and services either on a licensed software or outsourced basis as an increasing number of payment transactions are completed electronically and as our clients’ customers seek the 

  

convenience of 24hour digital access to their financial accounts within the payments segment we primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services debit and other cardbased payment products and services internet and mobile banking software and services and other electronic payments software and services including accounttoaccount transfers and persontoperson payments our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services 

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations now license software from thirdparties or outsource their data processing requirements by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products services capacity and capabilities the licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution and outsourcing through the utilization of service bureaus or facilities or resource management capabilities reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions

competition 

the market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology data processing affiliates of large companies large computer hardware manufacturers and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives in addition certain existing and potential financial institution clients may have the ability to create their own inhouse systems some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing competitive factors for our business include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and 

  

features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future additional information about the markets in which we compete is provided in the segment discussion below 

payments 

fidelity national information services inc “fis” jack henry and associates inc “jack henry” and online resources corporation compete with us most directly in our bill payment business western union is our primary competitor in our billerdirect bill payment and walkin payments businesses a number of other companies compete with us in our cardbased payment transaction processing business including first data corporation mastercard incorporated and visa inc certain existing and potential financial institution and biller clients also have the ability to develop and use their own inhouse systems instead of our products and services and many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

financial 

our products and services in the financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products this competition is intensified by the efforts of vendors and consultants who encourage clients to establish clientoperated data centers and the design and implementation of customized software solutions we also compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fis jack henry and open solutions inc 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by state regulatory authorities and representatives of the federal financial institutions examination council which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients auditors and regulators 

in addition in conducting our electronic commerce business including our walkin bill payment prepaid card online bill payment and popmoney and zashpay personal payment services we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws we are required among other matters to comply with annual reporting and licensing requirements to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted the “doddfrank act” the doddfrank act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies create a new agency responsible for 

  

implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements and implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices it also calls for a number of studies to be conducted and requires significant rulemaking the doddfrank act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry it is too early however to fully determine the overall impact of this complex legislation on us or our clients over the long term 

employees 

we have approximately 20000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the us are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing potential acquisition candidates we emphasize the quality and stability of the prospective company’s employees

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry a more troubled or prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources many of our larger existing and potential 

  

clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse as a result we often compete against our existing or potential clients’ inhouse capabilities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with clients generally run for a period of three to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

many financial institutions are experiencing operating losses including some of our clients in some cases these operating losses have resulted in the failure andor consolidation of financial institutions failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently 

  

increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to provide branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers these contracts are important to the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 was signed into law the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the “bcfp” and requires the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

we receive process store and transmit our clients’ and their customers’ sensitive information electronically unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems however advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may compromise or breach our security measures if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future including in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we may incur increased compliance costs or become subject to more stringent limitations on business processes in addition computer viruses distributed via the internet could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses or to comply with increasingly stringent privacy laws or security requirements could have a negative impact on our reputation could expose us to liability could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is infringing its 

  

intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

operational failures could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses could harm our business or cause us to lose clients interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in the past several years we have sold several businesses including fiserv health fiserv iss fiserv insurance and fiserv lfs in connection with these sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

we are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities it is also possible that new regulations will be imposed on us by the doddfrank act if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

checkfreepay a fiserv subsidiary is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file periodic reports in addition our payments businesses are subject to federal regulation in the united states including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 77 of our total assets at december 31 2011 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of checkfree on at least an 

  

annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 34 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition if our outstanding senior notes are downgraded to below investment grade we may incur additional interest expense if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

overview 

company background 

we are a leading global provider of financial services technology we provide account processing systems electronic payments processing products and services internet and mobile banking systems and related services we serve approximately 16000 clients worldwide including banks thrifts credit unions investment management firms leasing and finance companies retailers merchants and government agencies the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and we have experienced high contract renewal rates with our clients the majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are therefore nondiscretionary in nature 

our operations are primarily in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products “payments” segment the financial institution services “financial” segment and the corporate and other segment the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services debit and other cardbased payment products and services internet and mobile banking software and services and other electronic payments software and services including accounttoaccount transfers and persontoperson payments our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services the financial segment provides banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing and source capture services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 

in september 2011 we acquired cashedge inc “cashedge” a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as accounttoaccount transfer account opening and funding data aggregation small business invoicing and payments and persontoperson payments for approximately 460 million net of cash acquired the acquisition of cashedge is expected to advance our digital payments strategies 

in the first quarter of 2011 we acquired mobile commerce ltd “mcom” an international mobile banking and payments provider and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 50 million mcom enhances our mobile and payments capabilities and the other acquired companies add to or enhance specific products or services that we already provide 

enterprise priorities 

we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable bestinclass results for our clients these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships improving operational effectiveness being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation our key enterprise priorities for 2012 are i to deliver improved financial performance including an increased level of high quality revenue growth ii to further center the fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions and iii to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients 

industry trends 

market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally as a result financial institutions have 

  

exercised caution in their information technology spending despite this environment in 2011 our revenue increased 5 to 43 billion as compared to 2010 net income per share from continuing operations increased 2 to 340 which included a charge of 037 per share for the loss on early debt extinguishment as compared to 2010 and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 953 million we believe this revenue growth demonstrates the resilience of our recurring feebased revenue model the largely nondiscretionary nature of our products and services and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry in recent years many of our financial institution clients have finalized their spending decisions later in the year as a result we have seen and expect to continue to see a larger percentage of our annual revenue occurring in the second half of the year we believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that we provide to help them win and retain customers generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions 

in each of 2010 and 2009 approximately 1 of all financial institutions in the united states failed or were subject to government action the number of government actions and the average size of institutions impacted by such actions decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 these reductions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients in 2012 we believe that the number of government actions will continue to decline as compared to 2011 bank failures and forced consolidations have been to some extent offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform or elects to move to one of our platforms and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts these fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 

in addition legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated and will continue to generate numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry it is too early however to fully determine the overall impact of this complex legislation on us or our clients over the long term 

business developments 

we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments including persontoperson payments mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services account processing including acumen our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions we believe our wide range of marketleading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace 

critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

  

acquisitions 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in 2011 we early adopted guidance from the financial accounting standards board related to the assessment of qualitative factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment the adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements when reviewing goodwill for impairment we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price our financial performance market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then we perform a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test the first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2011 determined that our goodwill was not impaired based on the most recent fair value estimates the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements based on our impairment assessments in 2011 we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services revenue is recognized as services are provided revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

other 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than letters of credit we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate debt and foreign exchange rate risks we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

 total revenue 

total revenue increased 204 million or 5 in 2011 and increased 56 million or 1 in 2010 compared to the prior years the increase in total revenue during 2011 was primarily due to 8 revenue growth in our payments segment and 3 revenue growth in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2010 the increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2 revenue growth in our payments segment as compared to 2009 revenue from acquired companies contributed 30 million and 3 million to revenue in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

revenue in our payments segment increased 173 million or 8 in 2011 and increased 48 million or 2 in 2010 compared to the prior years revenue from acquired companies totaled 26 million and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately one percentage point in 2011 revenue growth in our payments segment during 2011 and 2010 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased 99 million or 6 and 58 million or 4 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses including our electronic banking and card services businesses in addition higher postage passthrough revenue which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business contributed approximately three percentage points of growth in this segment in 2011 in 2010 payments segment revenue growth of 2 was negatively impacted by lower product revenue in our output solutions business which decreased 10 million or 2 as compared to 2009 

  

revenue in our financial segment increased 53 million or 3 in 2011 and increased 9 million or 05 in 2010 compared to the prior years revenue growth in our financial segment was favorably impacted by increases of 42 million and 31 million or 2 in each of 2011 and 2010 in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and in 2010 by higher contract termination fee revenue revenue growth was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business in 2011 and 2010 in 2011 financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by an 11 million increase in product revenue primarily due to higher software license revenue and in 2010 product revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in software license revenue compared to the prior year periods 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 215 million or 7 in 2011 compared to 2010 and decreased 5 million or 02 in 2010 compared to 2009 total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 770 756 and 768 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 757 in 2011 compared to 742 in 2010 and 717 in 2009 the increase in cost of product in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in postage passthrough revenue and expenses in our output solutions business cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009 cost of product as a percentage of product revenue however increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in highermargin software license revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 59 million or 8 and decreased 11 million or 1 in 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to the prior years the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily in our corporate and other segment due to 18 million of employee severance expenses increased employee compensation and commission costs totaling 15 million and higher merger and integration costs of 12 million the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses and a 5 million gain on the sale of a facility which reduced expenses in 2010 

operating income and operating margin 

total operating income decreased 11 million or 1 in 2011 and increased 61 million or 6 in 2010 compared to the prior years operating income in 2011 was negatively impacted by higher expenses in our corporate and other segment and favorably impacted by operating income growth of 5 and 4 in our payments and financial segments respectively operating margin decreased to 230 in 2011 from 244 in 2010 and increased in 2010 from 232 in 2009 the operating margin decline of 140 basis points in 2011 was primarily due to increased operating losses in our corporate and other segment the operating margin improvement of 120 basis points in 2010 was due in part to operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure 

operating income in our payments segment increased 31 million or 5 and 8 million or 1 in 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 275 283 and 286 in 2011 2010 

  

and 2009 respectively and decreased 80 basis points in 2011 and 30 basis points in 2010 payments segment operating income in 2011 and 2010 was favorably impacted by improved revenue growth and increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our electronic payments businesses operating margins in 2011 and 2010 were negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services in addition operating margin in the payments segment in 2011 was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to increased postage passthrough costs which are included in both revenue and expenses 

operating income in our financial segment increased 22 million or 4 in each of 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior years operating margins improved in both years and were 306 303 and 293 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to improved revenue growth and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account and item processing businesses in addition in 2011 operating income and operating margin were positively impacted by higher software license revenue and negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with our new acumen account processing platform in 2010 operating income and margins were positively impacted by an increase in highermargin contract termination fee revenue and negatively impacted by a decrease in highermargin software license revenue 

the operating loss in our corporate and other segment increased 64 million in 2011 and decreased 31 million in 2010 compared to the prior years the operating loss increase in 2011 was primarily due to employee severance costs of 18 million higher merger and integration costs of 17 million a 9 million increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and a 5 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in 2010 the operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a 21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree corporation “checkfree” 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 10 million or 5 and 22 million or 10 in 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to the prior years these decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years and in 2010 a reduction in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2009 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in june 2011 we purchased 700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 in a tender offer for 754 million and in july 2011 we redeemed the remaining 300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for 322 million in october 2010 we purchased 250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 for 276 million we recorded pretax losses on early debt extinguishment for the premiums paid and other costs associated with these transactions of 85 million in 2011 and 26 million in 2010 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 351 in 2011 380 in 2010 and 372 in 2009 the lower effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of tax audits and changes in state tax laws the higher effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized in 2009 in connection with the final settlement of a checkfree purchase accounting income tax reserve 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

our 49 share of the income of stoneriver group lp “stoneriver” was 18 million 14 million and 12 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2011 the 4 million increase in income was primarily due to a 3 million gain on the sale of a business by stoneriver 

  

income loss from discontinued operations 

income loss from discontinued operations totaled 19 million 10 million and 3 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2009 we recognized a 25 million aftertax gain from the sale of a business

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 340 in 2011 compared to 334 in 2010 and 304 in 2009 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by losses on early debt extinguishment of 037 per share and 011 per share in 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2011 by 008 per share due to employee severance expenses the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets also reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 069 060 and 058 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 of 337 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations or operating cash flow decreased 5 million or 1 to 953 million in 2011 from 958 million in 2010 in 2011 our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a 28 million decrease in the portion of stoneriver dividends that are included in operating cash flow and a 12 million increase in working capital compared to 2010 our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures of 192 million and 175 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively were less than 5 of our total revenue in each year the 17 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 was primarily due to equipment purchases associated with a new data center 

in 2011 we acquired cashedge mcom and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of 511 million net of cash acquired in 2011 and 2010 we received cash dividends of 54 million and 61 million respectively from stoneriver the portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment 12 million in 2011 and 40 million in 2010 are reported in cash flows from operating activities

senior notes 

in june 2011 we issued 10 billion of senior notes comprised of 600 million of 3125 senior notes due in june 2016 and 400 million of 475 senior notes due in june 2021 which pay interest semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year in september 2010 we issued 300 million of 3125 senior notes due in october 2015 and 450 million of 4625 senior notes due in october 2020 which pay interest semiannually on april 1 and october 1 of each year our 68 senior notes due in november 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on may 20 and november 20 of each year the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that among other matters limit our ability to consolidate or merge into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens and our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 

  

in june 2011 we purchased 700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 in a tender offer for 754 million and in july 2011 we redeemed the remaining 300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for 322 million 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a 10 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate 23 at december 31 2011 there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements the facility expires in september 2014 as of december 31 2011 there were letters of credit totaling 28 million and no borrowings outstanding under the facility the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to i limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense 

interest rate hedge contracts 

we maintain interest rate swap agreements “swaps” with total notional values of 10 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates and forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements “forwardstarting swaps” with total notional values of 550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings the swaps and forwardstarting swaps expire in september 2012 and have been designated by us as cash flow hedges the swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weightedaverage rate of approximately 50 prior to financing spreads and related fees the forwardstarting swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted fiveyear and tenyear borrowings at weightedaverage rates of approximately 32 and 39 respectively 

shelf registration statement 

in 2010 we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock and debt securities or a combination thereof each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2011 we had a credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 20 in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 20 above the original interest rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients these subscriber funds are invested in shortterm instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity based on average subscriber funds balances during 2011 of approximately 10 billion a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pretax income by approximately 10 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual pretax income would decrease by less than 5 million 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts we currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of 1 billion and forwardstarting swaps with total notional values of 550 million at december 31 2011 to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2011 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2012 by less than 5 million 

we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions in 2011 7 of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2011 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

the markets we serve 

general 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same ultimate customers 

the growing volume and types of transactions and payment mechanisms have increased the data and transaction processing and other service needs of financial institutions we believe that financial institutions will be required to continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions and manage information in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure products services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify the required amounts of investments in capital and human resources 

the number of financial institutions in the united states continues to decline as a result of the current state of the economy as well as other market and regulatory pressures consolidation has not however resulted in a material reduction in the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole our revenue is diversified and our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation has on us we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and we typically enter into multiyear agreements our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25 of our annual revenue and our remaining revenue is spread across the balance of our client base our largest client represents approximately 6 of our annual revenue 

we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate electronic transactions will continue to increase which should translate to revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth in addition we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients our ongoing operations are reported in the payments and industry products “payments” and financial institution services “financial” business segments 

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other cardbased payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry our businesses in this segment also provide internet banking investment account processing services for separately managed accounts card and print personalization services and fraud and risk management products and services 

  

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing software from thirdparties or by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities which can enhance capacity and capabilities within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 

our strategy 

our vision is to be a global leader in transactionbased technology solutions our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions which enable bestinclass results for our clients we are focused on operating businesses where we have deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness a strong competitive position currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future longterm trusted ongoing client relationships which are not based on onetime transactions differentiated solutions that deliver higherthannormal value to our clients through integration and innovation and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner consistent with this focus we continue to execute the following strategic platforms 

enhanced client relationship value  we plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by among other matters continuing to integrate our product and services groups combining products and services to deliver improved value propositions and streamlining our service and support processes

competition 

payments 

fidelity national information services inc “fis” online resources corporation and jack henry and associates “jack henry” compete with us most directly as full service banking and bill payment competitors while other companies compete with us in specific business lines such as bill payment or online banking western union is the primary competitor to our billerdirect bill payment and walkin payments businesses a number of other companies compete with us in the cardbased payment transaction processing business including mastercard incorporated visa inc and first data corporation in addition the possibility of billers and financial institutions continuing to use or deciding to create inhouse systems to handle their own electronic billing and payment transactions and their own internet banking solutions in the case of financial institutions remains a competitive threat computer hardware vendors also offer customized software solutions that permit our clients to develop and use inhouse solutions over our products and services our markets are highly competitive and some of our competitors have substantial flexibility in competing with us including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services in addition many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

financial 

the market for technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies and large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions our software products compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified computer software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products competitive factors for account processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fis jack henry and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

government regulation 

fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing and electronic commerce operations are examined on a regular basis by the fdic the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift 

  

supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients their auditors and regulators 

in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted the “doddfrank act” the doddfrank act introduces substantial reforms to supervision and operation of the financial services industry including introducing changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies create a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements and implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices it also calls for a number of studies to be conducted and requires significant rulemaking we expect that the doddfrank act will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry until there are further developments in the rulemaking process however it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients 

in conducting our electronic commerce business we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in 2001 the usa patriot act amended the bank secrecy act to expand the definition of money services businesses “msbs” so that it may include businesses operated by us to this end in 2002 checkfree submitted a request for an administrative ruling from the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” with respect to whether fincen views checkfree as an msb to date we have not received a ruling from fincen if this part of our business is determined to be an msb then it will have to register with fincen as an msb and be regulated as such also nearly all states and the district of columbia have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register with that jurisdiction’s banking department we have registered with the relevant banking departments in addition our electronic commerce business is subject to the regulations of the office of foreign assets control the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the federal reserve board and when conducting certain transactions the grammleachbliley act checkfreepay corporation and its subsidiaries “checkfreepay” are registered as an msb with fincen for our walkin bill payment and zashpay personal payment services in addition checkfreepay currently maintains 46 licenses to comply with the various statutes that regulate money transmission mentioned above and we are subject to annual examinations by such jurisdictions 

from time to time in order to comply with our obligations under federal and state laws we are required to comply with annual reporting or licensing requirements and to implement operating policies and procedures to protect among other matters the privacy and security of our clients’ information 

employees 

we have approximately 19000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions savings institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the united states are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing potential acquisition candidates the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry a more troubled or prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients 

many financial institutions are experiencing operating losses including many of our clients in some cases these operating losses have resulted in the failure andor consolidation of banks and other financial institutions failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenue further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capabilities our existing large clients may also seek to perform internally portions of the services that we currently provide to them in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for account processing services generally run for a period of three to five years in our financial segment and provide for termination fees upon early termination our contracts with financial services organizations for electronic commerce services generally provide for terms of two to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services in addition it is possible that clients could seek to renegotiate terms with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse security and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to provide branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers these contracts are an important source of the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in the past several years we have sold several businesses including fiserv health fiserv iss fiserv insurance and fiserv lfs in connection with these sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale in particular in connection with the sale of fiserv iss we agreed to retain or to indemnify the buyers from certain liabilities associated with our operation of the business prior to its sale including liabilities that relate to legal actions including class action lawsuits individual lawsuits and arbitration 

  

proceedings in which plaintiffs who are owners of selfdirected individual retirement accounts for which fiserv iss acted as a custodian allege that we are responsible for the losses caused by ponzi schemes in which such plaintiffs were involved our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” was signed into law the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the “bcfp” and requires the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations at this time it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients to the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our clients our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients and such regulations could limit how much we can charge for our services we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our clients’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may violate the rights of others without our knowledge we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are infringing its intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations in addition we may also be liable for significant financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur significant expense in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

we receive process store and transmit our clients’ and their customers’ sensitive information electronically unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses can be distributed and rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation could expose us to liability could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing businesses could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing businesses could harm our business or cause us to lose clients interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 75 of our total assets at december 31 2010 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of checkfree on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our results of operations 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 34 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions 

  

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow more money from lenders or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not currently directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities it is also possible that new regulations will be imposed on us by the doddfrank act if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability 

checkfreepay is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file 

  

periodic reports in addition the businesses are subject to regulation in the united states by fincen including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions

not applicable 




 item 2 properties 

we currently operate fullservice data centers software system development centers and item processing and back office support centers in 122 cities we own 13 buildings and the remaining 157 locations where we operate our businesses are subject to leases expiring in 2011 and beyond in addition we maintain our own national data communication network consisting of communications processors and leased lines we believe our facilities and equipment are generally well maintained and are in good operating condition we believe that the computer equipment that we own and our various facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable business needs we periodically upgrade our mainframe capability we maintain our own and contract with multiple service providers to provide processing backup in the event of a disaster we also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us in the opinion of management the liabilities if any which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

market conditions and volatility over the past two years have created a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally as a result financial institutions have exercised caution in their information technology spending despite this challenging environment in 2010 our revenue was 41 billion net income per share from continuing operations was 334 and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 958 million which increased 1 10 and 13 respectively as compared to 2009 we believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring feebased revenue model the largely nondiscretionary nature of our products and services and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry we believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from inhouse transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions 

in each of 2010 and 2009 approximately 1 of all financial institutions in the united states failed or were subject to government action which has resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients however we believe that the number of government actions in 2011 will decline slightly as compared to 2010 the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations during the past two years has been to some extent offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform or elects to move to one of our platforms and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multiyear client contracts these fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 

in addition new legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry although it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients

critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable accounting guidance requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the 

  

appropriateness of our fair value measurements if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2010 determined that our goodwill was not impaired 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements based on our impairment assessments in 2010 we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services revenue is recognized as services are provided revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than letters of credit we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate debt and foreign exchange rate risks we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

financial results 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

 

  

   

total revenue 

 

 total revenue increased 56 million or 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased 510 million or 11 in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2 revenue growth in our payments segment and included a 05 increase in revenue in our financial segment in each case as compared to 2009 the decrease in total revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 which resulted in a decrease of 513 million or 11 as a result of this transaction the revenue of fiserv insurance is no longer included in our consolidated revenue beginning july 15 2008 in addition 2009 revenue was impacted by a 1 increase in revenue in our payments segment and a 3 decline in revenue in our financial segment incremental revenue from acquired companies was 3 million and 27 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

revenue in our payments segment increased 48 million or 2 in 2010 and increased 29 million or 1 in 2009 compared to the prior year periods revenue growth in our payments segment during 2010 and 2009 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased 58 million or 4 and 37 million or 2 in 2010 and 2009 respectively this growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses including our electronic banking and electronic funds transfer businesses payments segment revenue growth in 2010 was partially offset by lower product revenue which decreased 10 million or 2 as compared to 2009 due to lower revenue in our output solutions business primarily in the first quarter of 2010 in 2009 payments segment revenue growth was partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the us equity markets at that time and a decline in product revenue due primarily to lower software license revenue 

revenue in our financial segment increased 9 million or 05 in 2010 and decreased 50 million or 3 in 2009 compared to the prior year periods revenue growth in our financial segment during 2010 was favorably impacted by a 31 million or 2 increase in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and higher contract termination fee revenue and was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business which we expect will continue in 2011 decreased revenue in our mortgage lending business and lower software license revenue in 2009 financial segment revenue was negatively impacted by a 35 million decrease in contract termination fee revenue and a decline in check processing revenue 

total expenses 

total expenses decreased 5 million or 02 in 2010 compared to 2009 notwithstanding an increase in revenue in 2010 primarily due to increased operating leverage and effective management of our overall cost structure the decrease in total expenses in 2009 of 548 million or 15 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of 469 million or 13 

  

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 543 in 2010 from 554 in 2009 and 563 in 2008 the decreases in 2010 and 2009 which had a positive overall impact on our operating margin were favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses operating efficiency initiatives across the company and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 742 in 2010 compared to 717 in 2009 and 817 in 2008 cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009 however cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher margin project revenue in our output solutions business and lower software license revenue in 2008 the higher percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10 primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs which totaled 312 million in 2008 in both product revenue and cost of product 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 11 million or 1 and 62 million or 8 in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior year periods the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses the decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease of 36 million from our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance and lower integration expenses associated with our acquisition of checkfree corporation “checkfree” 

operating income and operating margin 

 

  

 total operating income increased 61 million or 6 and 38 million or 4 in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior year periods operating margin increased to 244 in 2010 from 232 in 2009 and 198 in 2008 the operating margin improvements of 120 basis points and 340 basis points in 2010 and 2009 respectively were due in part to our continuing operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure in addition the increase in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree and the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which generated lower operating margins partially offset by a decrease in highermargin contract termination fees 

  

operating income in our payments segment increased 8 million or 1 and 38 million or 7 in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 283 286 and 272 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and decreased 30 basis points in 2010 and increased 140 basis points in 2009 payments segment operating income and margin in 2010 compared to 2009 were impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services which we expect to enhance our long term revenue growth partially offset by increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses the increases in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 were primarily due to cost savings associated with the integration of checkfree and improved operating leverage in our electronic payments businesses partially offset by a decline in highermargin software license revenue 

operating income in our financial segment increased 22 million or 4 and 24 million or 4 in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior years operating margins were 303 293 and 274 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and increased 100 basis points in 2010 and 190 basis points in 2009 these improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to revenue growth in 2010 and scale and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account processing businesses in addition operating income and margin were positively impacted by an increase in highermargin contract termination fee revenue in 2010 and negatively impacted by a decline in contract termination fee revenue in 2009 

the operating loss in our corporate and other segment decreased 31 million and 20 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior years the operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a 21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree the operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower expenses primarily related to our acquisition of checkfree 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 22 million or 10 and 40 million or 15 in 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the prior years these decreases were primarily due to the continued reduction in total outstanding borrowings in 2010 and 2009 in addition interest expense in 2010 was lower than 2009 due to the positive impact of interest rate hedge contracts that expired at the end of 2009 

interest income 

interest income was 10 million 8 million and 13 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively interest income in 2008 was higher than 2010 and 2009 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of our business dispositions 

loss on early debt extinguishment 

in september 2010 we issued 750 million of senior notes in a public offering with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 40 in october 2010 we used a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes offering to purchase 250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 for 276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction as a result of this transaction we recorded a pretax loss on early debt extinguishment of 26 million 

loss on sale of businesses 

in 2008 we recognized a 21 million pretax loss due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

  

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 380 in 2010 372 in 2009 and 449 in 2008 the higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in addition our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement the significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows 

 

  

  income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

we record our 49 share of stoneriver’s net income 14 million 12 million and 6 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

income loss from discontinued operations 

income loss from discontinued operations totaled 10 million 3 million and 211 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2009 and 2008 we recognized aftertax gains from the sale of businesses of 25 million and 229 million respectively 

net income per share—diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 334 in 2010 compared to 304 in 2009 and 220 in 2008 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2010 partially offset by an 011 per share loss on early debt extinguishment net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009 a 034 per share aftertax loss on the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance recognized in 2008 and a 014 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of checkfree the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 060 058 and 057 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2010 of 563 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 971 million at december 31 2010 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations or operating cash flow increased 108 million or 13 to 958 million in 2010 from 850 million in 2009 our operating cash flow in 2010 included a 40 million dividend from stoneriver of which we own 49 that we do not expect to recur on an annual basis our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures of 175 million and 198 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively were less than 5 of our total revenue in each year 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we received 89 million from stoneriver of which we own 49 comprised of a 61 million dividend and a 28 million repayment of a loan the portion of this dividend that represented a return on our investment 40 million is reported in cash flows from operating activities

interest rate hedge contracts 

we maintain interest rate swap agreements “swaps” with total notional values of 10 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates additionally in 2010 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements “forwardstarting swaps” with total notional values of 200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings the swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan 

  

borrowings at a weightedaverage rate of approximately 50 prior to financing spreads and related fees and have expiration dates through september 2012 the forwardstarting swaps which expire in september 2012 effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted fiveyear and tenyear borrowings at weightedaverage rates of approximately 27 and 33 respectively 

shelf registration statement 

in 2010 we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock and debt securities or a combination thereof each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2010 we had a credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 20 in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 20 above the original interest rate the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a3 or its equivalent or higher by moody’s and a or its equivalent or higher by sp in each case with a stable or positive outlook 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2010 

 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants these subscriber funds are invested in shortterm instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government subscriber funds which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity and totaled approximately 14 billion as of december 31 2010 based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december 31 2010 a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately 10 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than 5 million 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts we currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of 1 billion and forwardstarting swaps with total notional values of 200 million at december 31 2010 to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december 31 2010 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2011 by approximately 1 million 

we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2010 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

the markets we serve 

general 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment deposit lending investment and risk management products and the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking thrift and credit union organizations continue to narrow as different types of entities seek to serve the same ultimate customers 

the growing volume and types of transactions and payment mechanisms have increased the data processing and other service needs of financial institutions we believe that financial institutions will be required to continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions and manage information in this rapidly evolving environment in addition we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the necessary products and services and in conducting data processing operations are essential to justify the necessary levels of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

the number of financial institutions in the united states continues to decline as a result of the current state of the economy as well as other market and regulatory pressures consolidation has not however resulted in a material reduction in the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation has on us and our revenue is diversified our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than one quarter of our annual revenue and our remaining revenue is spread across the balance of our client base finally we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and we typically enter into multiyear agreements 

we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate electronic transactions will continue to increase which should translate to revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth our ongoing operations are reported in the financial institution services “financial” and payments and industry products “payments” business segments 

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their banking operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing software from thirdparties or by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities which can enhance capacity and capabilities within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment primarily provide electronic bill payment and settlement electronic funds transfer and debit processing products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing 

  

needs of the financial services industry our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services internet banking investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients 

corporate transactions 

in 2009 we completed the sale of our loan fulfillment services business “fiserv lfs” and the sale of the balance of our investment support services business “fiserv iss” in 2008 we completed the sale of a majority of our health businesses “fiserv health” to unitedhealthcare services inc for approximately 480 million net of income taxes and transaction costs as well as the first of the two transactions to dispose of fiserv iss by selling fiserv trust company and the accounts of our institutional retirement plan and advisor services operations to td ameritrade online holdings inc for approximately 200 million net of income taxes and transaction costs we also completed the sale of a 51 interest in substantially all of the businesses in our insurance segment “fiserv insurance” to trident iv lp 

our strategy 

our vision is to be a global leader in transactionbased technology solutions our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions which enable bestinclass results for our clients to meet these goals we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives that we refer to as “fiserv 20” we are focused on operating businesses where we have deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness a strong competitive position currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future longterm trusted ongoing client relationships which are not based on onetime transactions differentiated solutions that deliver higherthannormal value to our clients through integration and innovation and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner consistent with this focus we have implemented and continue to execute the following strategic platforms 

enhanced client relationship value  we plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by among other matters continuing to integrate our product and services groups bundling products and services to deliver improved value propositions and streamlining our service and support processes 

acquisitions  we expect to acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need such as a product service or technology that helps fill a specific market requirement an opportunity to change market dynamics a way to achieve business scale or some similar consideration 

innovation  we seek to be an innovation leader in all of our key markets leveraging our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our markets 

operational excellence  we believe we can improve our performance by using the opportunities created by our size and scale for example we are using our consolidated buying power and shared utility structures to provide savings 

capital discipline  finally we intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our longterm growth and profitability which may include among other matters internal investment repayment of debt repurchases of our own shares capital improvements or acquisitions

competition 

financial 

the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies and large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions our software products compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified computer software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products 

  

competitive factors for account processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fidelity national information services inc jack henry and associates inc and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

payments 

fidelity national information services inc and online resources corporation compete with us most directly as full service banking billing and bill payment competitors a number of other companies compete with us in the electronic transaction processing business including mastercard incorporated visa inc and first data corporation in addition the possibility of billers and financial institutions continuing to use or deciding to create inhouse systems to handle their own electronic billing and payment transactions and their own internet banking solutions in the case of financial institutions remains a competitive threat inhouse solutions have been and will continue to be an option for our clients and a competitive factor facing our business we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services in addition many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

government regulation 

our data processing and electronic commerce subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing and electronic commerce operations are examined on a regular basis by the fdic the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors and regulators 

in conducting our electronic commerce business we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in 2001 the usa patriot act amended the bank secrecy act to expand the definition of money services businesses “msbs” so that it may include businesses operated by us to this end in 2002 checkfree submitted a request for an administrative ruling from the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” with respect to whether fincen views checkfree as an msb to date we have not received a ruling from fincen if this part of our business is determined to be an msb then it will have to register with fincen as an msb and be regulated as such also nearly all states and the district of columbia have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register with that jurisdiction’s banking department we have registered with the relevant banking departments in addition our electronic commerce business is subject to the regulations of the office of foreign assets control the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the federal reserve board and when conducting certain transactions the grammleachbliley act our walkin bill payment service provided by checkfreepay corporation and its subsidiaries “checkfreepay” is registered as an msb with fincen in addition checkfreepay currently maintains 44 licenses to comply with the various statutes that regulate money transmission mentioned above and we are subject to annual examinations by such jurisdictions 

  

from time to time in order to comply with our obligations under federal and state laws we may be required to comply with annual reporting or licensing requirements or to implement operating policies and procedures to protect among other matters the privacy and security of our clients’ information 

employees 

we have approximately 20000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial and insurance industries often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions savings institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the united states are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing potential acquisition candidates the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized 

available information 

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

many financial institutions are experiencing operating losses including many of our clients in some cases these operating losses have resulted in the failure andor consolidation of banks and other financial institutions failures mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenues further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by 

  

other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capabilities our existing large clients may also explore the possibility of internally performing portions of the outsourced services that we provide to them in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for account processing services generally run for a period of three to five years in our financial segment and provide for termination fees upon early termination our contracts with financial services organizations for electronic commerce services generally provide for terms of two to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services in addition it is possible that clients could seek to renegotiate terms with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently 

  

increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to provide branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers these contracts are an important source of the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 75 of our total assets at december 31 2009 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of checkfree on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our results of operations 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in the past several years we have sold several businesses including fiserv health fiserv iss fiserv insurance and fiserv lfs in connection with these sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale in particular in connection with the sale of fiserv iss we agreed to retain or to indemnify the buyers from certain liabilities associated with our operation of the business prior its sale including liabilities that relate to legal actions including class action lawsuits individual lawsuits and arbitration proceedings in which plaintiffs who are owners of selfdirected individual retirement accounts for which fiserv iss acted as a custodian allege that we are responsible for the losses caused by ponzi schemes in which such plaintiffs were involved our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may violate the rights of others without our knowledge we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are infringing its intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products or services and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations in addition we may also be liable for significant financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur significant expense in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

  

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

we receive process store and transmit our clients’ and their customers’ sensitive information electronically unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses can be distributed and rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation could expose us to liability could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 36 billion of total longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility to make acquisitions increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions 

our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenues and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth businesses we acquire may not perform as well as expected or be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow more money from lenders or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

  

operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could cause us to lose clients damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could damage our relationship with clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment in addition we may also be liable to third parties or owe service credits to our clients a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenues as a result of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our walkin payment business could subject us to liability 

checkfreepay is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file 

  

periodic reports in addition this business is subject to regulation in the united states by fincen including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial 

  

statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable accounting guidance requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of our fair value measurements if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2009 determined that our goodwill was not impaired 

we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value based on our impairment assessments in 2009 we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 

given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees deferred revenues consist primarily of advance billings for services revenue is recognized as services are provided revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than operating leases we use derivative financial instruments for managing 

  

our exposure to changes in interest rates managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate debt and foreign exchange rate risks we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

results of operations 

business segments 

our ongoing operations are comprised of the financial institution services “financial” segment payments and industry products “payments” segment and corporate and other segment the financial segment provides banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and settlement electronic funds transfer and debit processing products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services internet banking investment account processing services for separately managed accounts and fraud and risk management products and services the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and intercompany eliminations in july 2008 we completed the sale of a 51 interest in substantially all of the businesses in the insurance services “insurance” segment 

components of revenues and expenses 

the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

processing and services 

processing and services revenues which in 2009 represented approximately 80 of our consolidated revenues are primarily generated from account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed processing and services revenues are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel equipment and data communication infrastructure costs including costs to maintain applications client support depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 

product 

product revenues which in 2009 represented approximately 20 of our consolidated revenues are primarily derived from integrated print and card production 15 and software licenses 5 cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following costs of materials personnel infrastructure costs depreciation and amortization and other costs directly associated with product revenue prior to our sale of a 51 interest in substantially all of the businesses in our insurance segment “fiserv insurance” on july 14 2008 product revenues and cost of product also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel administrative employees and management advertising and promotional costs depreciation and amortization and other selling and administrative expenses 

  

results of operations 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

 

  

 total revenues 

 

 total revenues decreased 510 million or 11 in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased 910 million or 25 in 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease in total revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to 

  

our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 which resulted in a decrease of 513 million or 11 as a result of this transaction the revenues of fiserv insurance are no longer included in our consolidated revenues beginning july 15 2008 in addition 2009 revenues were impacted by a 1 increase in revenues in our payments segment and a 3 decline in revenues in our financial segment incremental revenue from acquired companies totaled 27 million or approximately 1 in 2009 the increase in total revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of checkfree corporation “checkfree” in december 2007 partially offset by decreased revenues in our insurance segment as a result of the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

revenues in our financial segment decreased 50 million or 3 in 2009 and increased 162 million or 9 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods financial segment revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by 2 percentage points or 35 million due to lower contract termination fee revenues which declined from 42 million in 2008 to 7 million in 2009 the businesses in our financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees these fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a contract is terminated in addition revenues in our financial segment were negatively impacted by lower discretionary spending by our financial institution clients and a decline in item processing revenues the increase in financial segment revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to incremental processing and services revenues from our acquisition of checkfree 

revenues in our payments segment increased 29 million or 1 in 2009 and increased 106 billion or 99 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods the revenue growth in our payments segment during 2009 was primarily driven by new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our bill payment and electronic funds transfer businesses partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the us equity markets and a decline in product revenues due primarily to lower software license revenues revenue increases in our payments segment during 2008 were primarily due to incremental processing and services revenue from our acquisition of checkfree 

total expenses 

total expenses decreased 548 million or 15 in 2009 and increased 738 million or 25 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods the decrease in total expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of 469 million or 13 the increase in total expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by decreased expenses due to the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 554 in 2009 from 563 in 2008 and 592 in 2007 the decreases in both 2009 and 2008 compared to the prior years were favorably impacted by overall improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of improved business mix and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure the decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to highermargin processing revenues associated with our acquisition of checkfree 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 717 in 2009 compared to 817 in 2008 and 797 in 2007 the lower percentage of revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10 percent primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in both product revenues and cost of product prescription product costs totaled 312 million and 449 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to no such costs in 2009 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 62 million or 8 in 2009 and increased 300 million or 58 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods the decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was impacted by a decrease of 36 million or 4 from our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in addition the decline in selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 was due to a 36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a preacquisition liability associated with our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by a 20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses the increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree including increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger related expenses partially offset by a decrease in expenses from our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

operating income and operating margin 

 

  

 total operating income increased 38 million or 4 in 2009 compared to 2008 operating margin increased to 232 in 2009 from 198 in 2008 operating margins improved by 340 basis points in 2009 due primarily to strong operating margin expansion in both the financial and payments segments the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree and the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which historically generated lower operating margins these positive factors were partially offset by decreases in highermargin contract termination fees 

total operating income increased 172 million or 23 in 2008 compared to 2007 operating margin decreased to 198 in 2008 from 200 in 2007 the overall increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree in december 2007 our operating margin in 2008 of 198 was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree and by declining operating margins in the insurance segment partially offset by strong results in our payments segment 

operating income in our financial segment increased 24 million or 4 in 2009 and 39 million or 8 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods operating margins were 293 274 and 276 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and increased 190 basis points in 2009 and declined 20 basis points in 2008 the improvements in operating income and operating margin in 2009 were primarily due to overall improvements in operating efficiencies cost reductions improved business mix and scale efficiencies in our bank and credit 

  

union account processing businesses these positive factors were partially offset by the negative impact of a 35 million decrease in highermargin contract termination fee revenues the increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree in december 2007 

operating income in our payments segment increased 38 million or 7 in 2009 and 326 million or 129 in 2008 compared to the prior year periods operating margins were 286 272 and 236 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and increased 140 basis points in 2009 and 360 basis points in 2008 the payments segment operating income and margin in 2009 and 2008 were positively impacted by cost savings associated with the integration of checkfree and growth in highermargin revenues resulting in improved operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses partially offset by a decline in software license revenues in 2009 in addition the increases in operating income and margin in 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by highermargin revenues associated with our acquisition of checkfree 

the operating loss in our corporate and other segment decreased 20 million in 2009 and increased 159 million in 2008 compared to the prior year periods the operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a 36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a preacquisition liability associated with our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by a 20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses and increased spending for several companywide initiatives in 2009 the operating loss increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree resulting in increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets of 117 million and merger related expenses of 29 million 

interest expense 

interest expense was 220 million 260 million and 76 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 40 million decrease in interest expense in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in total outstanding borrowings and interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 the 184 million increase in interest expense in 2008 was primarily due to new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our 44 billion acquisition of checkfree 

interest income 

interest income was 8 million 13 million and 7 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively interest income in 2008 was higher than 2009 and 2007 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of several business dispositions 

loss on sale of businesses 

in 2008 we recognized a 21 million pretax loss due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 372 in 2009 449 in 2008 and 382 in 2007 the higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in addition our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement the significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows

beginning in july 2008 we record our 49 share of fiserv insurance’s net income 12 million in 2009 and 6 million in 2008 as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations totaled 3 million 211 million and 27 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively income from discontinued operations includes aftertax gains from the sale of businesses of 25 million and 229 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

net income per share—diluted from continuing operations 

net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 304 in 2009 compared to 220 in 2008 and 244 in 2007 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009 a 034 per share aftertax loss on the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance recognized in 2008 and a 014 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of checkfree net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was negatively impacted by a 045 per share increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets the loss on the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance and a 011 per share increase in merger related expenses the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets reduced net income per sharediluted from continuing operations by 058 057 and 012 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2009 of 363 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 870 million at december 31 2009 

 

   

our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations or operating cash flow increased 84 million or 11 to 850 million in 2009 from 766 million in 2008 our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures were 198 million less than 5 of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008 

in 2009 we received net cash of 132 million related to discontinued operations including proceeds from the sale of businesses and contingent purchase price related to our 2008 sale of a portion of fiserv iss in the third quarter of 2009 fiserv insurance of which we own 49 refinanced its outstanding debt in conjunction with the refinancing we loaned fiserv insurance 67 million with interest payable quarterly and the principal due in 2013 in december 2009 fiserv insurance repaid 10 million of this loan 

share repurchases 

we purchased 175 million 441 million and 469 million of our common stock in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively on may 20 2009 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of our common stock shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans as of december 31 2009 we had 22 million shares remaining under this authorization on february 24 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million additional shares of our common stock 

indebtedness 

 

 in 2009 we used a portion of our operating cash flow to repay 475 million of debt which reduced our total outstanding debt including current maturities to 364 billion at december 31 2009 our longterm debt currently consists primarily of 188 billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility and 175 billion under senior notes borrowings we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2009 

senior term loan 

in december 2007 we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks our term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in november 2012 principal payments of 255 million and 375 million are due in december 2010 and 2011 respectively and the remaining principal of 125 billion is due in november 2012 the weightedaverage variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 09 at december 31 2009 the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements the revolving credit facility as amended contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense the facility expires on march 24 2011 as of december 31 2009 we issued letters of credit totaling 30 million under this facility and our available borrowings were 870 million 

  

senior notes 

in november 2007 we issued 125 billion of 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 and 500 million of 68 senior notes due in november 2017 which pay interest at the stated rate on may 20 and november 20 of each year the interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that among other matters limit our ability to consolidate or merge into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person our ability to create or assume liens and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 

interest rate hedge contracts 

to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements “swaps” with total notional values of 12 billion at december 31 2009 the swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weightedaverage rate of approximately 48 prior to financing spreads and related fees and have expiration dates through september 2012 

shelf registration statement 

in 2007 we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock and debt securities or a combination thereof each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2009 we had a credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a negative outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 20 in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 20 above the original interest rate the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a3 or its equivalent or higher by moody’s and a or its equivalent or higher by sp in each case with a stable or positive outlook 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2009 

 

  

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitativ e disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants these subscriber funds are generally invested in shortterm instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government subscriber funds which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity and totaled approximately 14 billion as of december 31 2009 based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december 31 2009 a 1 increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately 15 million and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than 2 million 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts we currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of 12 billion at december 31 2009 to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of december 31 2009 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2010 by less than 10 million 

we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2009 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position

 item 1 business 

overview 

we provide integrated information management and electronic commerce systems and services including transaction processing electronic bill payment and presentment business process outsourcing document distribution services and software and systems solutions we serve approximately 16000 clients worldwide including banks and thrifts credit unions savings institutions retailers and merchants leasing companies lenders government agencies and publicly and privately owned companies we operate centers in the united states for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related businesses our operations are principally located in the united states in 2008 our international operations contributed approximately 5 of total revenues from argentina australia canada china colombia costa rica france india indonesia luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

we were formed through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions since we began we have grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring businesses that complement ours we originally incorporated in delaware in 1984 and reincorporated as a wisconsin corporation in 1992 our headquarters are located at 255 fiserv drive brookfield wisconsin 53045 and our telephone number is 262 8795000 

  

the markets we serve 

general 

we believe that the growing volume and types of transactions and payment mechanisms have increased the data processing and other service needs of financial institutions and we believe that these institutions will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources for information systems requirements application of more specialized systems and development maintenance and enhancement of applications software in addition the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new lending investment deposit payment and risk management products and the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking thrift and credit union organizations continue to narrow as different types of entities seek to serve the same ultimate customers we believe that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

the number of financial institutions in the united states continues to decline as a result of economic market and regulatory factors consolidation has not however resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole our focus on longterm client relationships and recurring transactionoriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation has on us in addition our revenue is diversified our top client represents approximately 5 of our annual revenue and the next 49 financial institution clients represent approximately 17 of our annual revenue the remaining 78 of our revenue is spread across the balance of our client base finally we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and we typically enter into multiyear agreements 

in 2009 due in part to the current state of the economy we anticipate less account processing system switching by all depository institutions which should benefit us given the number of account processing clients that we have we also anticipate that demand will continue for products focused on gathering deposits managing efficiency and meeting risk and regulatory needs all of which should translate to revenue opportunities for us as a result we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of nondiscretionary recurring revenuebased products and services gives us a solid foundation that will continue to show strength even in these difficult times our ongoing operations are reported in the financial institution services “financial” and payments and industry products “payments” business segments 

financial 

the businesses in our financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their banking operations many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing software from thirdparties or by contracting with thirdparty processors this has allowed them to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 

payments 

the businesses in our payments segment provide products and services that address a range of technology needs for the financial services industry including internet banking electronic bill payment electronic funds transfer and debit processing fraud and risk management capabilities card and print personalization services check imaging and investment account processing services for separately managed accounts we believe that the 

  

integration of our internet banking and electronic bill payment and settlement capabilities with our account processing and risk management solutions creates a compelling value proposition for clients 

corporate transactions in 2008 

in january 2008 we completed the sale of a majority of our health businesses “fiserv health” to unitedhealthcare services inc for approximately 480 million net of income taxes and transaction costs in february 2008 we completed the first of two transactions to dispose of our investment support services segment “fiserv iss” by selling fiserv trust company and the accounts of our institutional retirement plan and advisor services operations to td ameritrade online holdings inc for approximately 200 million net of income taxes and transaction costs in a second transaction robert beriault holdings inc has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of fiserv iss including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts this portion of the fiserv iss disposition remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval by the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” we also completed the sale of three other subsidiaries in 2008 del mar database inc insurance wholesalers insurance services inc and caregain inc the financial results of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

in july 2008 we completed the sale of a 51 interest in substantially all of the businesses in our insurance segment “fiserv insurance” to trident iv lp we received cash proceeds of approximately 500 million and a 30 million note beginning on july 15 2008 we no longer consolidate revenues and expenses of fiserv insurance and report our 49 share of net income as a separate line item on our statement of income

competition 

financial 

the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies and large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions our software products compete in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified computer software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products 

competitive factors for account processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions including fidelity national information services inc metavante technologies inc jack henry and associates inc and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

payments 

our primary competition in the electronic commerce market is the traditional paperbased method of receiving and paying bills in addition the possibility of billers and financial institutions continuing to use or deciding to create inhouse systems to handle their own electronic billing and payment transactions and their own internet banking solutions in the case of financial institutions remains a significant competitive threat inhouse solutions have been and will continue to be an option for our clients and a competitive factor facing our business 

metavante technologies inc and online resources corporation compete with us most directly as full service banking billing and bill payment competitors a number of other companies compete with us by providing some but not all of the services that make up our complete ebill and electronic pay anyone service including yodlee mastercard international and visa in the area of internet consumer banking we primarily 

  

compete with other companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions to large financial institutions including s1 corporation and with companies that offer software platforms designed for internal development of internetbased financial services software we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services in addition many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

government regulation 

our data processing and electronic commerce subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing and electronic commerce operations are examined on a regular basis by the fdic the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors and regulators 

in conducting our electronic commerce business we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in 2001 the usa patriot act amended the bank secrecy act “bsa” to expand the definition of money services businesses so that it may include businesses such as checkfree checkfree submitted a request for an administrative ruling from the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” in 2002 with respect to whether fincen views checkfree as a money services business to date checkfree has not received a ruling from fincen if checkfree’s business is determined to be a money services business then checkfree will have to register with fincen as a money services business and be regulated as such also nearly all states and the district of columbia have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission the sale of traveler’s checks including money orders and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction’s banking department and checkfree has registered as a money transmitter where required in addition our electronic commerce business is subject to the regulations of the office of foreign assets control the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the federal reserve board and when conducting certain transactions the grammleachbliley act 

our walkin bill payment service is registered as a money service business with fincen we have established and maintain a program to provide a system of controls and procedures that we believe is reasonably designed to detect prevent and report actual or suspected violations of the bsa money laundering statutes antiterrorism statutes and other illicit activity we requested an administrative ruling from fincen in 2003 regarding whether fincen considers all or some of our walkin bill payment service to be a money services business we made a supplemental ruling request in 2008 fincen has not yet issued a ruling if our walkin bill payment business is determined to be a money services business then we will be regulated accordingly if not we will deregister the walkin bill payment service as a money service business in addition we currently maintain 44 licenses to comply with the various money transmitter statutes mentioned above and we are subject to annual audits by such jurisdictions 

from time to time in order to comply with our obligations under federal and state laws we may be required to comply with annual reporting or licensing requirements or to implement operating policies and procedures to protect among other matters the privacy and security of our clients’ information 

  

employees 

we have approximately 20000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial and insurance industries often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks thrifts credit unions savings institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in programming software development modification and maintenance computer operations network control and technical support client services and training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing system conversions sales and marketing and account management 

none of our employees in the united states are represented by a union and there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing potential acquisition candidates the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized 

available information 

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions 

for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we may be particularly exposed to the current global economic recession for example our financial segment has been negatively impacted by a significant reduction in homeequity processing revenues resulting from the decline in the us mortgage markets a poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

many banks and financial institutions are experiencing significant operating losses including many of our clients in some cases these operating losses have resulted in the failure andor consolidation of banks and other financial institutions failures mergers and consolidations of banks and financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients which could adversely affect our revenues further if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services it is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions 

  

resulting from mergers or consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capabilities our existing large clients may also explore the possibility of internally performing portions of the outsourced internet banking and electronic billing and payment services that we provide to them in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for account processing services generally run for a period of three to five years in our financial segment and provide for termination fees upon early termination our contracts with financial services organizations for electronic commerce services generally provide for terms of two to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services in addition it is possible that one or more clients could seek to renegotiate terms with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our 

  

electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to provide branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers these contracts are an important source of the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 70 of our total assets at december 31 2008 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of checkfree on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our results of operations 

we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of fiserv health fiserv iss or fiserv insurance pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements 

in 2008 we completed the sale of several significant businesses in connection with the sales we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to be liable for certain liabilities resulting from our operation of such businesses prior to the sale pursuant to the terms of the agreements we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers for certain material adverse events arising out of or related to our prior operation of the business and for any breach of a representation or warranty our obligation to indemnify a purchaser in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not complete the sale of the remainder of fiserv iss in the time frame we anticipate or at all and we are subject to the risks of the operation of that business 

we have entered into an agreement to sell the remainder of fiserv iss which primarily provides back office and custody services for selfdirected individual retirement accounts the completion of the sale is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the satisfaction of the conditions to the completion of the sale the parties to the sale obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals including approval from the fdic legal proceedings that may be instituted against us or others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the applicable disposition agreement and our ability to obtain the expected proceeds from the disposition these and other factors could cause our ability to complete the disposition on the terms and within the time frame anticipated to be different than expected therefore there is no guarantee that we will be able to complete the transaction we are subject to the risks of operating the remainder of the fiserv iss business until we complete the sale or if we are unable to complete the sale which include compliance with applicable regulations data security risks and potential legal proceedings with respect to the operation of this business such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights we may violate the rights of others without our knowledge we may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims if a litigant establishes that we are infringing its intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights are invalid we may be forced to change our products services or manufacturing processes and such changes may be expensive or impractical we may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from such litigant if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms we may 

  

be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations in addition we may also be liable for significant financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights and we may incur significant expense in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit they may result in costly and time consuming litigation and may divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit our clients’ and their customers’ sensitive information unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses can be distributed and rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation could expose us to liability could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 41 billion of total longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and limit our flexibility to make acquisitions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms particularly given current economic and credit market conditions 

we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of checkfree 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of fiserv and checkfree and we cannot assure you that the combination of the two companies will result in the realization of the anticipated economic operational and other benefits from the acquisition within expected time frames or at all in particular we have estimated that we will be able to achieve annual cost savings of more than 100 million and annual revenue synergies of more than 125 million over the next several years as we integrate the checkfree acquisition our ability to achieve those savings and synergies depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control and we will not be able to fully assess these opportunities until after the integration is complete as a result the integration of checkfree may not generate expected revenue synergies crossselling opportunities or cost savings on the expected time frames or at all if we are unable to successfully implement our planned integration with checkfree and realize the expected benefits from the acquisition our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenues and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth businesses we acquire may not perform as well as expected or be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

these risks may arise for a number of reasons we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers we may need to borrow more money from lenders or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us changes in accounting tax securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could cause us to lose clients damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could damage our relationship with clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment in addition we may also be liable to third parties or owe service credits to our clients a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenues as a result of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate 

  

remedy effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our walkin payment business could subject us to liability 

checkfreepay is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file periodic reports in addition this business is subject to regulation in the united states by fincen including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions

critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment we use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

  

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” sfas 142 requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge additionally we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2008 determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not impaired given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than operating leases we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate longterm debt and foreign exchange rate risks we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the anticipated adoption dates which is incorporated herein by reference 

nongaap financial measure 

in this report we refer to internal revenue growth percentage which is a nongaap financial measure we use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows shareholders to understand the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth this nongaap financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap the method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

  

internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenues for the current period less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior period plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions” “acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents preacquisition revenue of acquired companies for the prior period internal revenue growth percentage is calculated as follows 

 

 results of operations 

business segments 

we acquired checkfree corporation “checkfree” on december 3 2007 in connection with the integration of checkfree and the significant expansion of our payments related businesses along with associated organizational changes we reclassified our reporting segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business as a result effective january 1 2008 our operations consist of the following business segments financial institution services “financial” payments and industry products “payments” insurance services “insurance” and corporate and other the financial segment provides banks thrifts and credit unions with account processing services item processing services loan origination and servicing products cash management and consulting services and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions the payments segment provides products and services that address a range of technology needs for the financial services industry including internet banking electronic bill payment electronic funds transfer and debit processing fraud and risk management capabilities card and print personalization services check imaging and investment account processing services for separately managed accounts in 2008 we completed the sale of a 51 interest in substantially all of the businesses in the insurance segment the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and intercompany eliminations

results of operations 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

 

  

   

total revenues 

 

 total revenues increased 842 million or 22 in 2008 compared to 2007 and 353 million or 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in total revenues during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of checkfree in december 2007 partially offset by decreased revenues in our insurance segment as a result of our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 as a result of this transaction the revenues of fiserv insurance are no longer included in our consolidated revenues beginning july 15 2008 but are included for all historical periods the increase in total revenues during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to increased prescription product revenues in our insurance segment and increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of checkfree 

revenues in our financial segment increased 94 million or 5 in 2008 and 63 million or 3 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods the revenue increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to incremental processing and services revenues from our acquisition of checkfree the revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily driven by new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in our banking and credit union account processing businesses internal revenue declined 2 in our financial segment during 2008 and increased 2 in 2007 internal revenues were negatively impacted by three percentage points and one percentage point in 2008 and 2007 respectively due to the significant downturn in the us mortgage markets which resulted in a decline in homeequity processing revenues of 70 million and 23 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition the internal revenue growth rate in our financial segment during 2008 was negatively impacted by slower discretionary spending by our financial institution clients resulting in reduced highermargin revenue such as license fees and associated professional services 

revenues in our payments segment increased 106 billion or 99 in 2008 and 207 million or 24 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods these increases were primarily due to incremental processing and services revenue from our acquisition of checkfree the internal revenue growth percentages in our payments segment of 6 and 9 in 2008 and 2007 respectively were primarily driven by new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses including our expedited bill payment and electronic funds transfer processing businesses along with solid growth in our output solutions businesses 

revenues in our insurance segment decreased 291 million or 36 in 2008 and increased 98 million or 14 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods revenues declined in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 the revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to our acquisition of a workers’ compensation transaction processing business in the third quarter of 2007 partially offset by a 33 million decrease in highermargin flood claims processing revenues 

  

total expenses 

total expenses increased 691 million or 22 in 2008 and 281 million or 10 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods the increase in total expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by a decrease in expenses in our insurance segment caused by our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in 2008 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 580 in 2008 from 614 in 2007 and 638 in 2006 these decreases were primarily due to highermargin processing revenues associated with our acquisition of checkfree and overall improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of improved business mix and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased to 817 in 2008 from 797 in 2007 and 778 in 2006 the increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a 94 million increase in prescription product costs during the first half of 2008 prior to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which generated historical operating margins in the midsingle digits due primarily to the inclusion of prescription product costs in both product revenues and cost of product in addition cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2008 was negatively impacted by a 45 million increase in postage passthrough revenue and expenses in our output solutions businesses the increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily driven by an 82 million increase in prescription product costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 293 million and 75 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to the prior year periods and increased as a percentage of revenues to 176 in 2008 from 139 in 2007 and 131 in 2006 the increases in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by a decrease in expenses in our insurance segment resulting from our sale of a 51 interest in that business as a result of our acquisition of checkfree amortization expense for acquired intangible assets included in selling general and administrative expenses increased by 79 million in 2008 compared to 2007 and incremental merger costs including integration project management retention bonuses and other expenses were 37 million and 8 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

operating income and operating margin 

 

  

   

total operating income increased 151 million or 20 in 2008 compared to 2007 operating margin decreased 02 percentage points to 188 in 2008 from 190 in 2007 the overall increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of checkfree in december 2007 our operating margin in 2008 of 188 was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree and by declining operating margins in the insurance segment in addition the strong results in our payments segment positively impacted overall operating margins partially offset by the slight negative impact of our financial segment in 2008 

total operating income increased 72 million or 11 in 2007 compared to 2006 operating margin increased 02 percentage points to 190 in 2007 from 188 in 2006 operating income and margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 were positively impacted by increases in highermargin revenues in our electronic payments businesses continued strong operating results in our bank and credit union account processing businesses the acquisition of checkfree and improvements in overall operating efficiencies these positive factors were partially offset by a decline in operating margin in the insurance segment primarily due to a 33 million decrease in highermargin flood claims processing revenues 

operating income in our financial segment increased 20 million or 4 in 2008 and 94 million or 22 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods operating margins were 249 251 and 212 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and declined 20 basis points in 2008 and increased 390 basis points in 2007 operating income and margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 were negatively impacted by a 70 million decline in homeequity processing revenues in our lending business and decreases in highermargin revenues such as software license fees and associated professional services operating income and margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 increased significantly due primarily to highermargin revenue growth in our bank and credit union account processing businesses improved business mix and overall operating efficiencies resulting primarily from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure 

operating income in our payments segment increased 326 million or 129 and 51 million or 25 in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year periods operating margins were 272 236 and 234 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and increased 360 basis points in 2008 and 20 basis points in 2007 the significant increases in operating income and margin in 2008 compared to 2007 were driven primarily by highermargin revenues and cost synergies associated with our acquisition of checkfree growth in our other electronic payments businesses such as our expedited bill payment and electronic funds transfer businesses and improved operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing businesses within our payments segment 

operating income in our insurance segment decreased 34 million or 44 in 2008 and 32 million or 29 in 2007 compared to the prior year periods operating margins were 87 97 and 156 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and declined 100 basis points in 2008 and 590 basis points in 2007 the decrease in operating income in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in 2008 the decreases in operating income and margin in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily due to a 33 million decrease in highermargin flood claims processing revenues 

the operating loss in our corporate and other segment increased 161 million in 2008 and 41 million in 2007 compared to the prior year periods these increases were primarily due to incremental amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets of 119 million and 15 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively and merger and integration related items associated with our acquisition of checkfree totaling 59 million and 11 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

interest expense 

interest expense was 260 million 76 million and 41 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increases in interest expense were primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our 44 billion acquisition of checkfree 

  

interest income 

interest income was 13 million 7 million and 0 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively interest income in 2008 was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from our business dispositions interest income in 2007 was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the acquisition of checkfree 

loss on sale of businesses 

in 2008 we recognized a 24 million pretax loss which was primarily due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 451 in 2008 382 in 2007 and 378 in 2006 the higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to a 34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance which was due to a significantly lower tax basis in the stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold the tax provision related to sale of businesses increased the effective income tax rate in 2008 by 69 percentage points from 382 to 451 we expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 385 in 2009 

income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

due to our sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance in july 2008 we record our 49 share of fiserv insurance’s net income 6 million in 2008 as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations totaled 223 million 25 million and 60 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in income from discontinued operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to aftertax gains of 230 million related to the sales of a portion of fiserv iss and all of fiserv health the decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to sale related expenses 

net income per share—diluted 

net income per sharediluted for 2008 was 349 compared to 260 in 2007 and 253 in 2006 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 212 in 2008 compared to 245 in 2007 and 220 in 2006 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was negatively impacted by a 046 per share increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets a 035 per share aftertax loss on the sale of businesses which includes the sale of a 51 interest in fiserv insurance and 014 per share due to an increase in merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of checkfree partially offset by a decrease in facility shutdown and related costs that were incurred in 2007 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2008 of 232 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 784 million 

 

 our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations or operating cash flow increased 210 million or 37 to 775 million in 2008 from 565 million in 2007 this significant increase was primarily due to strong operating cash flow associated with our acquisition of checkfree and overall improvements in working capital of 43 million depreciation and amortization increased 176 million in 2008 primarily due to a 119 million increase in intangible amortization associated with acquisitions our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures rather than to pay dividends our capital expenditures increased 43 million to 199 million in 2008 compared to 156 million in 2007 due primarily to capital expenditures associated with checkfree our capital expenditures were less than 5 of total revenues in 2008 

share repurchases 

we purchased 441 million 469 million and 560 million of our common stock in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively on july 2 2008 we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans as of december 31 2008 we had 12 million shares remaining under our authorization 

indebtedness 

 

 in 2008 we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from business dispositions primarily to repay 13 billion of debt which reduced our outstanding debt including current maturities to 41 billion at december 31 2008 our longterm debt currently consists primarily of 225 billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility 175 billion under senior notes borrowings and 100 million under our 900 million revolving credit facility we were in compliance with all debt covenants in 2008 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility the revolving credit 

  

facility as amended contains various restrictions and covenants that require us among other things to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple ranging between 35 and 45 of consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense the facility expires on march 24 2011 the weightedaverage variable interest rate on revolving credit facility borrowings was 19 at december 31 2008 at december 31 2008 our outstanding borrowings on this facility were 100 million and available borrowings were 784 million 

senior term loan 

in december 2007 we borrowed 25 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks this term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and matures in november 2012 a scheduled principal payment of 250 million is due in december 2009 payments of 375 million are due in december 2010 and 2011 and the remaining principal of 125 billion is due in november 2012 the weightedaverage variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 21 at december 31 2008 the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above 

senior notes 

in november 2007 we issued 125 billion of 6125 senior notes due in november 2012 and 500 million of 68 senior notes due in november 2017 which pay interest at the stated rate on may 20 and november 20 of each year the interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that among other matters limit our ability to consolidate or merge into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person our ability to create or assume liens and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 

interest rate hedge contracts 

to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements “swaps” with total notional values of 175 billion at december 31 2008 the swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weightedaverage rate of approximately 45 prior to financing spreads and related fees the swaps have expiration dates through september 2012 

shelf registration statement 

in 2007 we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock and debt securities or a combination thereof each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

other 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our debt securities perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock as of december 31 2008 we had a credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and bbb with a negative outlook from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” on our senior unsecured debt securities 

  

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody’s or sp downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes if the ratings from moody’s or sp decrease below investment grade the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 20 in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 20 above the original interest rate the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a3 or its equivalent or higher by moody’s and a or its equivalent or higher by sp in each case with a stable or positive outlook 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements the interest component of longterm debt obligations and minimum operating lease payments are reported on a pretax basis the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2008 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates currency exchange rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings and foreign currency risk we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

in connection with processing electronic payments transactions the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants these subscriber funds are generally invested in shortterm instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government subscriber funds which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity and totaled approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2008 based upon interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december 31 2008 a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual income from continuing operations by approximately 10 million 

fiserv iss which is included in discontinued operations is a custodian of selfdirected individual retirement accounts it accepts retirement account deposits from clients and invests the funds in securities substantially all of which are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities fiserv iss utilizes simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities a formal asset liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks capital ratios liquidity levels portfolio diversification credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines we do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results from discontinued operations or our financial condition 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts we currently use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a 

  

counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount based on our longterm debt with variable interest rates as of december 31 2008 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2009 by approximately 10 million we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at december 31 2008 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in foreign currency rates against the us dollar if these rates were 10 higher or lower at december 31 2008 there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position

the markets we serve 

our operations are classified into three business segments our financial institution services business segment our “financial” segment our insurance services business segment our “insurance” segment and our checkfree business segment our “checkfree” segment the businesses that make up our financial segment provide account and transaction processing systems and services to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions and other financial intermediaries the businesses that comprise our insurance segment provide a wide range of services to insurance carriers agents and distributors the businesses that comprise our checkfree segment provide online banking electronic billing and payment software applications and investment management solutions to financial institutions and financial services organizations checkfree is presented as a separate segment because it was acquired on december 3 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and checkfree integration plans are finalized 

financial 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions undergoes continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new lending investment deposit and payment products the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking thrift and credit union organizations as well as by insurance and securities firms continue to narrow as traditionally different entities seek to serve the same ultimate customers in addition financial institutions continue to consolidate in response to market and regulatory pressures 

although the number of financial institutions in the united states has been reduced consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole in addition to stay competitive financial institutions seek to provide customers with new products and services which are typically transactionoriented and feebased accordingly we believe that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of information technology products and services the growing volume and types of transactions accounts and payment mechanisms have increased the data processing and other service needs of financial institutions and we believe that these institutions will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources for information systems more specialized systems and development maintenance and enhancement of applications software we believe that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

we provide financial institutions with outsource services or with software to run operations internally many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing software from thirdparties or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account item lending and payment processing services and other products to support numerous types of financial transactions and risk management solutions 

  

insurance

checkfree 

we believe checkfree brings us complementary technology services and clients an important objective of the integration process is to join checkfree’s internet banking and electronic bill payment and settlement capabilities with our core account processing and risk management solutions to create a compelling value proposition for clients checkfree’s electronic commerce business serves 21 of the top 25 financial institutions in the united states and processes more than one billion transactions per year we believe we will be able to expand our existing relationships and grow our presence with these toptier financial institutions similarly we believe there is a significant opportunity to deploy checkfree’s electronic bill payment solutions within our sizable client base together with checkfree our solutions address a range of technology needs for the financial services industry including core bank processing services internet banking electronic billing and payment and fraud and risk management capabilities cash and logistics management and automated clearing house “ach” services check imaging and the leading technology platform for managed accounts as a result we believe the combined organization will deliver a wider range of products and services to clients creating new opportunities for growth and enhanced efficiency including the ability to bring new solutions to market faster

competition 

financial 

the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competition for inhouse data processing and software 

  

departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions 

competitive factors for processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries including fidelity national information services inc metavante technologies inc jack henry and associates inc and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

insurance 

the market for information technology products and services is highly competitive in the insurance market we face competition from internal information technology departments service affiliates of large companies independent technology and service firms education and licensing firms and application and business processing outsourcers we compete with information technology firms such as accenture ltd cgi group inc choicepoint inc computer sciences corporation dst systems inc electronic data systems corp international business machines corporation insurance services office inc perot systems corporation sungard data systems inc sap ag and vertafore inc which offer largescale solutions application outsourcing business process outsourcing and professional delivery some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do we also compete with a number of local and regional firms which compete on the basis of their flexibility and local presence 

checkfree 

our primary competition in the electronic commerce market is the traditional paperbased method of receiving and paying bills in addition the possibility of billers and financial institutions continuing to use or deciding to create inhouse systems to handle their own electronic billing and payment transactions and their own internet banking solutions in the case of financial institutions is a significant competitive threat inhouse solutions have been and will continue to be an option for our clients and a competitive factor facing our business 

metavante technologies inc competes with us most directly from the perspective of providing “pay anyone” solutions to financial services organizations and online resources corporation competes with us from the perspective of a full service banking billing and bill payment competitor a number of other companies compete with us by providing some but not all of the services that make up our complete ebill and electronic pay anyone service including yodlee mastercard international and visa in the area of internet consumer banking we primarily compete with other companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions to large financial institutions including s1 corporation with companies that offer software platforms designed for internal development of internetbased financial services software we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services in addition many companies that provide outsourced internet finance solutions are consolidating creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines 

the checkfree software business competes in several different market segments and geographies including with large diversified computer software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio accounting software and outsourced services and with inhouse solutions developed by large financial institutions 

  

government regulation 

our data processing and electronic commerce subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing and electronic commerce operations are examined on a regular basis by the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities because we use the federal reserve’s ach network to process many of our transactions we are subject to the federal reserve board’s rules with respect to its ach network in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors and regulators 

in conducting our electronic commerce business we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money in 2001 the usa patriot act amended the bank secrecy act “bsa” to expand the definition of money services businesses so that it may include businesses such as checkfree checkfree submitted a request for an administrative ruling from the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” in 2002 with respect to whether fincen believes checkfree to be a money services business to date checkfree has not received a ruling from fincen if checkfree’s business is determined to be a money services business then checkfree will have to register with fincen as a money services business and be regulated as such also nearly all states and the district of columbia have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission the sale of traveler’s checks including money orders and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction’s banking department and checkfree has registered as a money transmitter where required in addition our electronic commerce business is subject to the regulations of the office of foreign assets control the grammleachbliley act and the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the federal reserve board

we have approximately 25000 employees many of whom are specialists in our information management centers and related product and service companies this service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial and insurance industries often complemented by management and other employees with direct experience in banks credit unions insurance companies and agencies mortgage firms savings institutions and other financial services environments our employees provide expertise in sales and marketing account management and client services computer operations network control and technical support programming software development modification and maintenance conversions and client training business process outsourcing item and mortgage processing and financial planning and related support services 

  

none of our employees in the united states are represented by a union there have been no work stoppages strikes or to our knowledge attempts to organize the service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset although the market for qualified personnel is competitive we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining our staff of top industry professionals in assessing potential acquisition candidates the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities our existing large clients may also explore the possibility of internally performing portions of the outsourced internet banking and electronic billing and payment services that we provide to them in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors including international providers of similar products and services which may have lower cost structures than ours we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our applications if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of our upgrade efforts it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

  

the market for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability 

if the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services in addition if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions our margins could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations businesses billers internet portals and other third parties to provide branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers these contracts are an important source of the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products if any of these third parties abandons curtails or insufficiently increases its marketing efforts it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for core services generally run for a period of three to five years in our financial segment and provide for termination fees upon early termination our contracts with financial services organizations for electronic commerce services generally provide for terms of two to five years at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

the integration of fiserv and checkfree may prove to be difficult and may strain our administrative operational and financial resources 

our acquisition of checkfree is substantially larger than any of our previous acquisitions the expansion of our business and operations resulting from the acquisition of checkfree including the differences in the strategies and infrastructures of our companies may strain our administrative operational and financial resources the integration of fiserv and checkfree will require the time effort attention and dedication of management resources and may distract management from their other responsibilities the integration process could create a number of potential challenges and adverse consequences including the possible unexpected loss of key employees clients or suppliers a possible loss of sales an increase in operating and other costs and the need to modify and integrate operating and accounting controls and procedures as well as information systems we may have difficulty integrating checkfree’s operations with our operations including with respect to coordinating geographically separate organizations coordinating marketing functions and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures in addition the integration of checkfree may subject us to liabilities existing at checkfree some of which may be material or unknown these types of challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of checkfree 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of fiserv and checkfree and we cannot assure you that the combination of the two companies will result in the realization of the anticipated economic operational and other benefits from the acquisition within expected time frames or at all in particular we have estimated that we will be able to achieve annual cost savings of more than 100 million and annual revenue synergies of more than 125 million 

  

over the next several years as we integrate the checkfree acquisition our ability to achieve those savings and synergies depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control and we will not be able to fully assess these opportunities until after the integration is complete as a result the integration of checkfree may not generate expected revenue synergies crossselling opportunities or cost savings on the expected time frames or at all if we are unable to successfully implement our planned integration with checkfree and realize the expected benefits from the acquisition our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 60 of our total assets at december 31 2007 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of checkfree on at least an annual basis we assess whether there has been an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings any determination resulting in the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and financial position which could be material 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 54 billion of longterm debt including current maturities we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate or other purposes limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and limit our flexibility to make acquisitions our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry consolidations of financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform internally some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our transaction processing businesses we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients and their customers unauthorized access to our computer systems 

  

could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation could expose us to liability could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could cause us to lose clients damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could damage our relationship with clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment in addition we may also be liable to third parties or owe service credits to our clients we have installed backup systems and procedures to prevent or reduce disruption a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenues as a result of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

current economic conditions could negatively affect demand for our products and services 

cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect the profitability and revenue growth of those that use our products and services including banks credit unions and other financial institutions as a result unfavorable economic conditions that negatively impact the results of operations of financial institutions such as losses from subprime mortgages could negatively impact spending of current and potential clients and sales to new clients and upgrades or complementary product sales to existing clients could be negatively affected this could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenues and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth businesses we acquire may not perform as well as expected or be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities specifically we may be required to comply with among other regulations the health insurance portability and accountability act which governs the privacy and security of health information and the regulations pertaining to the national flood insurance program if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our walkin payment business could subject us to liability 

checkfreepay is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required these licenses require us to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file periodic reports in addition this business is subject to regulation in the united states by fincen including antimoney laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or from certain individuals or entities the complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business in addition any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy effective patent trademark service 

  

mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices or pay significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property require us to redesign our applications if feasible divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use necessary technologies third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future applications and services

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 recent developments 

in december 2007 we acquired checkfree a leader in electronic commerce services and products including electronic bill payment and internet banking for approximately 44 billion in cash and sold credstar a mortgage credit reporting unit in the first quarter of 2008 we sold fiserv health to unitedhealthcare services inc for 721 million in cash which amount includes initial adjustments for net working capital and certain indebtedness of fiserv health and its subsidiaries as of the closing and we sold the majority of our fiserv investment support services business to td ameritrade online holdings inc for 225 million in cash at closing plus the amount of acquired regulatory capital we also sold del mar database a provider of loan broker management products in the first quarter of 2008 the operations of fiserv health fiserv iss and the two lending businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

in connection with the sale of the portion of the fiserv iss business to td ameritrade online holdings inc we can earn contingent cash consideration of up to 100 million based on the achievement of revenue targets over the twelve months subsequent to closing with respect to the second part of the fiserv iss transaction robert beriault holdings inc has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of fiserv iss including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts for approximately 50 million in cash we will retain a minority interest in this business however our continuing involvement is not expected to be significant this portion of the fiserv iss disposition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008 and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions 

our operations are classified into three business segments our financial institution services business segment our insurance services business segment and our checkfree business segment due to the planned disposition of fiserv iss our previously reported investment support services business segment is included in our results of discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2008 we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and checkfree integration plans are finalized 

critical accounting policies 

general 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment we use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” sfas 142 requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge additionally we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2007 determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not impaired given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements 

other 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than operating leases in addition we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate longterm debt 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the anticipated adoption dates which is incorporated herein by reference 

nongaap financial measure 

in this report we refer to internal revenue growth percentage which is a nongaap financial measure we use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows investors to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth this nongaap financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap the method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

  

internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior year plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions” “acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents preacquisition revenue of acquired companies less dispositions for the prior year “acquired revenue from acquisitions” was 147 million 44 million in the financial segment and 103 million in the insurance segment and 99 million 66 million in the financial segment and 33 million in the insurance segment in 2007 and 2006 respectively internal revenue growth percentages exclude our recent acquisition of checkfree because only a partial month of checkfree revenue was recorded in december 2007 

results of operations 

components of revenues and expenses 

the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

processing and services

processing and services revenues increased 8 and 6 in 2007 and 2006 respectively compared to the prior year periods these increases were driven by sales to new clients crosssales to existing clients increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions including a partial month of processing and services revenues totaling 84 million from the acquisition of checkfree on december 3 2007 partially offsetting these increases in 2007 were a 33 million decrease in flood claims processing revenues in our insurance segment and revenue decreases in our lending processing businesses due to lower processing volumes primarily resulting from a downturn in the mortgage markets in the united states partially offsetting the increases in 2006 were a 35 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005 contract termination fees were 35 million 23 million and 58 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively businesses in our financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees these fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired 

  

product revenues increased 14 and 21 in 2007 and 2006 respectively compared to the prior year periods these increases were primarily due to incremental revenue attributable to new clients and increased volumes in the insurance segment’s workers’ compensation businesses growth in card fulfillment and print services within our output solutions division and an acquisition in 2007 the revenue growth in our workers’ compensation businesses was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of 449 million 367 million and 295 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 291 million or 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 and 322 million or 12 in 2006 compared to 2005 these increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues declined to 616 in 2007 as compared to 634 and 631 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2007 was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the financial segment resulting from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs and the positive impact of highermargin transaction and payment related revenues partially offset by a decrease in highermargin flood claims processing revenues 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 797 in 2007 778 in 2006 and 771 in 2005 the increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2007 and 2006 as discussed above 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 142 in 2007 from 136 and 126 in 2006 and 2005 respectively selling general and administrative expenses in 2007 were negatively impacted by the following charges totaling 12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses to reduce our cost structure due in part to the significant downturn in the mortgage markets in the united states in the second half of 2007 merger and integration costs of 8 million related to our acquisition of checkfree including integration project management employee severance and retention bonuses a charge of 8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our whollyowned offshore captive operation and amortization expense of 6 million related to intangible assets acquired in the checkfree acquisition selling general and administrative expenses in 2007 and 2006 included 13 million and 16 million respectively of incremental sharebased compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 in addition 2006 included charges of 9 million related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses

operating income increased 65 million or 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 and operating margins were 186 in 2007 and 2006 compared to 204 in 2005 our operating margin in 2007 compared to 2006 was positively impacted by strong performance in our financial segment offset by our insurance segment performance and several charges as explained below in 2007 operating income and margins were positively impacted by increases in highermargin revenues in our electronic payments businesses continued strong operating results in our bank and credit union core processing businesses and improvements in overall operating efficiencies in addition checkfree contributed operating income of 14 million in the month of december these positive factors were partially offset by a 33 million decrease in highermargin flood claims processing revenues in our insurance segment charges totaling 12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses merger and integration costs of 8 million related to our acquisition of checkfree and a charge of 8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our whollyowned offshore captive operation 

  

operating income and margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was positively impacted by strong financial and insurance segment results and was negatively impacted by a 35 million decrease in highermargin contract termination fees a 22 million increase in sharebased compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 operating losses associated with our australian check processing operations and charges of 9 million related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses 

in addition operating margins in both 2007 and 2006 were negatively impacted by revenue growth in our workers’ compensation businesses which generate operating margins in the low to midsingle digits the negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately two percentage points in 2007 2006 and 2005 

segment results

checkfree is presented as a separate segment because it was acquired on december 3 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and checkfree integration plans are finalized the following table presents for the years indicated revenues operating income and operating margin for our business segments 

 

  

     

financial 

revenues in our financial segment increased 168 million or 6 in 2007 and 227 million or 9 in 2006 the internal revenue growth rate in the financial segment was 4 and 6 in 2007 and 2006 respectively with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments businesses along with new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses in 2007 internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to a decrease in revenues in our home equity loan processing businesses due primarily to a decline in volumes associated with weakness in the mortgage markets in the united states in the second half of 2007 in 2006 internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point from a decrease in contract termination fees

interest expense and interest income 

interest expense was 76 million 41 million and 28 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the 35 million increase in interest expense in 2007 was primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our acquisition of checkfree because of these new borrowings which had a combined principal balance of 425 billion at december 31 2007 we expect that interest expense will be significantly higher in 2008 as compared to 2007 the 13 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was due primarily to higher interest rates and increased average borrowings outstanding in 2006 compared to 2005 

interest income was 7 million 0 and 7 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively interest income in 2007 was earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the checkfree acquisition the interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses 

realized gain from sale of investments 

in 2005 we realized a pretax gain of 44 million from the sale of 32 million shares of common stock of bisys group inc in addition we sold our investment in intria items inc to our joint venture partner canadian imperial bank of commerce which resulted in a pretax gain of 43 million 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 383 in 2007 378 in 2006 and 376 in 2005 the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted as compared to 2007 primarily by changes in state tax laws the finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments we expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 385 in 2008 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations which includes fiserv health fiserv iss credstar del mar database and our securities clearing businesses totaled 31 million in 2007 and 62 million in 2006 and 2005 the decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2007 was primarily due to 18 million of charges related to disposition activities including retention bonuses employee severance and other sale related expenses and a 14 million charge at fiserv health for employee severance facility shutdown and other charges to cease an investment in a new technology platform in the health plan management business in the second quarter of 2007

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 of the company and our report dated february 27 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

 item 1 business 

overview 

we provide integrated information management systems and services including transaction processing business process outsourcing document distribution services and software and systems solutions we serve more than 18000 clients worldwide including banks credit unions financial planners and investment advisers insurance companies and agents selfinsured employers leasing companies lenders savings institutions retailers and merchants universities government bodies notforprofit organizations and industrial companies we operate centers in the united states for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related product businesses our operations are principally located in the united states in 2006 our international operations contributed approximately 3 of total revenues through business support centers in argentina australia canada china colombia costa rica india indonesia malaysia mexico the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

we were formed through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions historically these firms expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations as well as other financial institutions since we began we have grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring firms complementing our organization 

we originally incorporated in delaware in 1984 and reincorporated as a wisconsin corporation in 1992 our headquarters are located at 255 fiserv drive brookfield wisconsin 53045 and our telephone number is 262 8795000 

our markets 

our operations are classified into three business segments our financial institution services business segment our “financial” segment our insurance services segment which includes health life and property and 

  

casualty our “insurance” segment and our investment support services business segment our “investment” segment the businesses that make up the financial segment provide account and transaction processing systems and services to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions and other financial intermediaries the businesses that comprise our insurance segment provide a wide range of services to insurance carriers agents distributors thirdparty administrators and selfinsured employers the businesses that comprise our investment segment provide administrative custodial and processing services to individual investors retirement plan and pension administrators financial planners and investment advisors 

financial 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions undergoes continuous change the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new lending investment deposit policy and benefit administration and payment products the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking thrift and credit union organizations as well as by insurance and securities firms continue to narrow as traditionally different entities seek to serve the same ultimate customers 

financial institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market and regulatory pressures although market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the united states consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole 

to stay competitive in this changing marketplace financial institutions are providing their customers with a wide variety of new products and services that are typically transactionoriented and feebased the growing volume and types of transactions accounts and payment mechanisms have increased the data processing and other service needs of these institutions as a result we believe that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of information technology products and services 

we expect that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources for information systems requirements application of more specialized systems and development maintenance and enhancement of applications software we believe that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

we provide financial institutions with software to run operations internally or outsource services many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from thirdparties or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities 

within the financial segment we provide banks thrifts and credit unions with account item lending and payment processing services and other products to support numerous types of financial transactions and risk management solutions 

insurance 

the insurance industry like other industries that we serve has requirements for basic administration services and information processing systems we provide policy and benefit administration rating claims administration billing and reinsurance administration services to insurance carriers agents distributors thirdparty administrators and selfinsured employers the insurance industry is generally comprised of three markets health life and property and casualty all three of these markets possess a significant and increasing need for information technology and related service solutions 

  

health 

our clients in the health market are traditional insurance carriers commercial health plans managed care companies thirdparty administrators and selfinsured employers all of which must administer health plans and process the claims associated with those plans we provide these customers with a variety of services including claim adjudication and payment services customer service reporting and other related services 

as health care costs continue to rise payors continue to seek to reduce costs this may result in existing clients seeking to add services in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies over the longer term we have responded to the market demand for cost containment solutions by expanding our service offerings beyond traditional health plan administration to include pharmacy benefits management care management and subrogation and fee negotiation services for example with our acquisition of caregain in 2006 we expanded our offerings to include technology and service solutions for the administration of consumer directed health plans that feature health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts 

life 

our clients in the life market are insurance companies and intermediaries such as agents and brokers who provide life insurance and annuities for individuals we provide our clients with technology and related services to enable them to process applications rate quote underwrite and issue policies bill premiums comply with regulatory requirements and report results because of the ongoing need for new business generation in this market there is a proliferation of new products as a result we expect to experience increased demand for technology and related services that are required to support new products as well as to maintain service for previously issued products 

property and casualty 

our clients in the property and casualty market are insurance companies and intermediaries such as agents and brokers who provide property and casualty insurance to businesses and consumers we provide technology and services to our clients to enable them to process applications rate quote underwrite and issue policies bill premiums pay claims comply with regulatory requirements and report results 

property and casualty carriers and agents are faced with increasing competition and seek to use information technology to provide better service to their policyholders as well as to control the costs of their operations commoditization of their products and cyclical market conditions put pressure on them to distinguish their products and services to help them meet this need we provide a number of products including agency rating solutions and claims processing technology for example with our acquisition of insureworx in 2006 we expanded our offerings to include webbased software for workers’ compensation coverage providers that integrates underwriting policy administration billing and claims solutions 

investment 

in the investment segment we provide a variety of administrative custodial and processing services to individual investors retirement plan and pension administrators investment advisors and financial planners and other financial intermediaries the specific services that we offer include securities custody transaction processing client reporting and retirement plan administration 

our strategy 

our mission is to be a global leader in transactionbased technology solutions that provides integrated technology and services solutions to enable bestinclass results for our clients 

  

historically we have pursued this goal by implementing a strategy that focused on new product and service development improved cost effectiveness of services aggressive solicitation of new clients and opportunistic and strategic acquisitions in 2006 we reviewed and reassessed our operations and identified several ways to refine our historical business strategies we refer to the strategies and initiatives that emerged from our analysis as “fiserv 20” 

in implementing our fiserv 20 initiative we intend to focus on operating businesses where we have deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness a strong competitive position currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future longterm trusted ongoing client relationships which are not based on onetime transactions differentiated solutions that deliver higherthannormal value to our clients through integration and innovation and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner 

consistent with this focus we are implementing several strategies that we believe will help us build on our historical business practices to achieve the objectives of fiserv 20 

enhanced client relationship value  we plan to extend and grow our existing client relationships by among other matters implementing tighter integration across our product and services groups bundling more products and services to deliver improved value propositions and streamlining our service and support processes 

acquisitions  we expect to acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need such as a product service or technology that helps fill a specific market requirement an opportunity to change market dynamics a way to achieve business scale or some similar consideration 

innovation  we will seek to become innovation leaders in our key markets leveraging our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our markets we expect to explore these opportunities both domestically and abroad 

operational excellence  we believe we can improve our performance by using the opportunities created by our size and scale for example we expect to improve our performance by more effectively using our consolidated buying power and shared utility structures to provide savings 

greater capital discipline  finally we intend to make capital allocation decisions based on the investments that offer the best prospects for longterm growth and profitability for our company taken as a whole these investments may include among other matters repurchases of our own shares capital improvements or acquisitions 

acquisitions

competition 

financial 

the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions 

competitive factors for processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage 

we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries including fidelity national information services inc metavante corporation jack henry and associates inc and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

insurance 

the market for information technology products and services is highly competitive in the insurance market we face competition from internal information technology departments service affiliates of large companies and independent technology and service firms we compete with information technology firms such as accenture ltd cgi group inc choicepoint inc computer sciences corporation dst systems inc electronic data systems corp ibm insurance services office inc perot systems corp sap ag and vertafore inc which 

  

offer largescale solutions and professional delivery some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do we also compete with a number of local and regional firms which compete on the basis of their flexibility and local presence 

investment 

several trust companies including sterling trust company pensco trust company ast trust company and reliance trust company compete with us in custody services for retirement account administration with respect to the provision of services to financial advisors and pension administrators charles schwab  co and fidelity investments are our most significant competitors 

government regulation 

our data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors and regulators 

the insurance markets in which we operate are principally regulated under state law however there is also significant federal legislation with which we or our clients may be required to comply including the national flood insurance program the fair credit reporting act the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act and the grammleachbliley act from time to time in order to comply with our obligations under state and federal laws we may be required to comply with annual reporting and licensing requirements and to implement operating policies and procedures to protect among other matters the privacy and security of patients’ health care information in addition to state and federal regulation various clients require periodic audits of their health plan administrator to confirm compliance with standards of performance and we may be required to forfeit a portion of our fees if we fail to meet the required performance levels

available information 

our website address is wwwfiservcom we are not including the information provided on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success we may not be successful in developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our applications if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of our upgrade efforts it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for core services generally run for a period of three to five years in our financial segment and 

  

provide for termination fees upon early termination at the end of the contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenues and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate similar or complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth businesses we acquire may not perform as well as expected or be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our transaction processing businesses we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose service providers other than us 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry consolidations of financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the 

  

larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform internally some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could cause us to lose clients damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could damage our relationship with clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment we have installed backup systems and procedures to prevent or reduce disruption a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenues as a result of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to choose service providers other than us 

our ability to compete in the health plan administration business requires us to arrange for network provider services with third parties over whom we have no control 

in order to provide administrative services to our clients who sponsor selfinsured health plans we must in most cases arrange for these clients to have access to a third party provider network in any particular market provider networks could refuse to contract with us or only do so on terms that would not allow us to compete with our competitors if these provider networks refuse to contract with us or only do so on terms that place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to compete or be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected in addition the large national health insurance carriers with which we compete for administration services have their own proprietary networks these networks in some instances allow our competitors to offer our target clients access to a health care network that offers better discount rates than we have access to which may result in us being required to offer lower prices for administrative services in order to compete for clients 

we may experience software defects development delays or installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability 

if we fail to comply with regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions as a trust company or as an administrator of health services or if the national flood program is amended or substantially changed our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities in addition our trust subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the colorado division of banking and the fdic 

our health plan management services subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels covering licensing and other daytoday operating policies and procedures in addition 

  

most of our health plan management services businesses are subject to health insurance portability and accountability act regulations that govern the privacy and security of health information to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of health information 

our flood processing services business depends on administration of the national flood insurance program by the federal government substantive changes to the current national flood insurance program could have an adverse impact on our revenues or costs of doing business 

if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices or pay significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

  

  

  

 third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future applications and services 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 




 item 2 properties 

we currently operate fullservice data centers software system development centers and item processing and backoffice support centers in over 200 cities we own 15 facilities and all other buildings in which centers are located are subject to leases expiring through 2007 and beyond in addition we maintain our own national data communication network consisting of communications processors and leased lines 

  

we believe our facilities and equipment are generally well maintained and are in good operating condition we believe that the computer equipment that we own and our various facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable business needs we periodically upgrade our mainframe capability we maintain our own and contract with multiple service providers to provide processing backup in the event of a disaster we also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us other than as described below in the opinion of management the liabilities if any which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 a class was certified by the united states district court for the central district of california in a lawsuit that was filed in 2005 against the fiserv trust company “fiserv trust” the suit alleges that fiserv trust which serves as a custodian and administrator of investment accounts knew or should have known that third parties were perpetrating an alleged ponzi scheme and that it breached its contractual and common law duties and aided and abetted the scheme by not advising the plaintiffs to avoid investing in the alleged scheme the lawsuit was brought on behalf of a class of investors who maintained selfdirected individual retirement accounts administered by fiserv trust and others who invested in the alleged scheme including investors that were never customers of fiserv trust and seeks compensatory damages of 120 million and punitive damages fiserv trust has filed a petition for permission to appeal the class certification order there is a related action in california superior court in san diego california seeking compensatory damages of approximately 7 million and punitive damages we believe that the suits are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously nevertheless we are unable to estimate or predict the ultimate outcome of these matters or to determine whether these matters will have a material adverse impact on our investment support services segment results or our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations our discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 recent developments 

historically our operations consisted of three business segments based on the services provided by each financial institution outsourcing systems and services health plan management services and investment support services as part of our fiserv 20 initiative we are focused on providing products and services in a more integrated manner accordingly in december 2006 we announced a reorganization of our businesses to provide for a more streamlined structure the new organization allows us to provide integrated technologybased solutions to each of the three main areas of the insurance industry health life and property and casualty as a result of this reorganization we have modified our reporting segments such that our new reporting segments are financial institution services “financial” insurance services “insurance” and investment support services “investment” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transactionbased fees revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are longterm in nature generally three to five years and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition our revenue recognition practices do not contain significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the underlying carrying value or reporting unit carrying value to their fair values as of the most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2006 we determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets do not exceed their respective fair values we are required to perform this comparison which involves a number of assumptions at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment given the significance of goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements 

we do not participate in nor have we created any offbalance sheet variable interest entities or other offbalance sheet financing other than operating leases in addition we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floatingrate longterm debt 

recent accounting pronouncements 

statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants and similar awards we adopted sfas 123r on january 1 2006 under the modified prospective method accordingly prior periods 

  

do not include sharebased compensation expense related to sfas 123r sharebased compensation expense was 285 million and 40 million during 2006 and 2005 respectively prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stock options restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” under apb 25 the difference between the quoted market price on the date of grant and the contractual purchase price of shares was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period as a result we did not recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for stock options because the exercise price was not less than 100 of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur the recognition provisions of sfas 158 became effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 the adoption of sfas 158 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we expect that the adoption of fin 48 will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

in this report we use two nongaap financial measures internal revenue growth percentage and free cash flow we use these measures to monitor and evaluate our performance and they are presented in this report because we believe that they are useful to investors in evaluating our financial results nongaap financial measures should not be considered to be a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap the methods that we use to calculate nongaap financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior year plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions” “acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents preacquisition revenue of acquired companies less dispositions for the prior year “acquired revenue from acquisitions” was 1113 million 693 million in the financial segment and 421 million in the insurance segment and 675 million 445 million in the financial segment and 230 million in the insurance segment in 2006 and 2005 respectively internal revenue growth percentage is a nongaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it allows them to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth 

free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it shows our available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital requirements of our operations 

  

results of operations 

components of revenue and expenses 

the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

processing and services 

processing and services revenues are primarily generated from account and transactionbased fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel equipment and data communication infrastructure costs including costs to maintain applications customer support depreciation and other operating expenses 

product 

product revenue is primarily derived from our pharmacy businesses software license fees and integrated print and electronic communications a significant amount of product revenue is derived from our pharmacy businesses within the insurance segment because we include in both revenues and expenses the prescription product costs associated with these businesses we do not manufacture or generally distribute prescription pharmaceuticals but we are considered to be a principal under emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements therefore we record these revenues and expenses on a gross basis prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were 7531 million 5400 million and 4396 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively cost of products in addition to pharmacy product costs include personnel infrastructure costs and other costs directly associated with product revenue 

we also include customer reimbursements such as postage and telecommunication costs in processing and services revenue product revenue cost of processing and services and cost of product in accordance with eitf 0114 “income statement characterization of reimbursements received for ‘outofpocket’ expenses incurred” these costs which are passthrough expenses to clients and which are included in both revenues and expenses were 4161 million 3510 million and 3792 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel administrative employees and management advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses 

  

results of operations 

the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the percentage change in those amounts from year to year this information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

 

   total revenues 

total revenues increased 4847 million or 12 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 3297 million or 9 in 2005 compared to 2004 the internal revenue growth rate was 9 in 2006 and 7 in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients crosssales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients the improvement in the total revenue growth rate for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased prescription revenue from new clients in the insurance segment’s pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses 

processing and services revenues increased 5 in 2006 and 6 in 2005 compared to the prior year periods these increases were driven by sales to new clients crosssales to existing clients increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions partially offsetting these increases in 2006 were a 345 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005 contract termination and assignment fees were 234 million 579 million and 364 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the financial segment businesses generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees these fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired 

product revenues increased 30 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 18 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to new clients in the insurance segment’s pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses 

  

along with growth in card fulfillment and print services within the output solutions division the revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses in the insurance segment was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of 7531 million 5400 million and 4396 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

total expenses 

total expenses increased 4858 million or 15 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2439 million or 8 in 2005 compared to 2004 these increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs 

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues were relatively consistent in 2006 as compared to 2005 and the slight increase from 64 in 2005 to 65 in 2006 was primarily caused by a decrease of 345 million in 2006 of higher margin contract termination fee revenue these fees which were significantly higher in 2005 than 2006 do not generate substantial incremental cost when received cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues decreased in 2006 and 2005 from 67 in 2004 due primarily to changes in the mix of our businesses including acquisitions and the impact of operating efficiencies 

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 82 in 2006 81 in 2005 and 80 in 2004 the increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2006 and 2005 as discussed above 

selling general and administrative expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 selling general and administrative expenses in 2006 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of 173 million of incremental sharebased compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 and 90 million related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division 

operating income and operating margin 

operating income decreased 11 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and operating margins decreased to 16 in 2006 from 18 in 2005 and 2004 operating income and margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a 345 million decrease in higher margin contract termination fees a 245 million increase in sharebased compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 operating losses associated with the australian check processing operations and charges of 90 million related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division partially offsetting these decreases in operating income and margin were increases in higher margin revenues in the electronic payments and flood insurance processing businesses continued strong operating results in bank and credit union core processing and improvements in overall operating efficiencies 

in addition operating margins in 2006 and 2005 were negatively impacted by the significant revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses which generate operating margins in the low to midsingle digits the negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately 3 percentage points in 2006 and 2005 and 2 percentage points in 2004 

segment results 

in connection with organizational changes in 2006 we reclassified our reportable segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business as a result our continuing operations are classified into three business segments financial institution services “financial” 

  

insurance services “insurance” and investment support services “investment” the historical business segment information presented below has been restated to conform to our new business segment reporting structure 

 

  financial 

the financial segment increased total revenues by 2274 million or 9 in 2006 and 1986 million or 8 in 2005 the internal revenue growth rate in the financial segment was 6 in 2006 and 2005 with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments and loan settlement services businesses along with new client growth and increased sales in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses in 2006 internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by a 345 million decrease in contract termination fees and the loss of two clients in 2005 in 2005 internal revenue growth was positively impacted by a 215 million increase in contract termination fees 

operating margins in the financial segment were 20 in 2006 22 in 2005 and 21 in 2004 in comparison to 2005 operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted by a decrease of 345 million in higher margin contract termination fees an increase of 208 million in sharebased compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 operating losses associated with the australian check processing operations and charges totaling 90 million related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division partially offsetting these negative factors in 2006 were higher margin revenues in the electronic payments businesses continued strong operating results in the bank and credit union processing businesses and overall operating efficiencies operating margins in 2005 were positively impacted over 2004 primarily by a 215 million increase in contract termination fees 

insurance 

revenues in the insurance segment increased 2546 million or 20 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 1223 million or 11 in 2005 compared to 2004 the internal revenue growth rate in this segment was 16 in 2006 and 8 in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions the internal revenue growth rates were primarily driven by the signing of new clients in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses 

  

operating margins in the insurance segment were 10 in 2006 compared to 11 in 2005 and 2004 operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted primarily by the significant increase in revenues in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses which generate operating margins in the low to midsingle digits and expenses associated with our consumerdirected health care initiatives partially offsetting these factors were higher operating margins in our flood and property and casualty insurance businesses the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the insurance segment by 10 percentage points 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

investment 

the investment segment had revenue growth of 27 million in 2006 and 89 million in 2005 representing revenue growth of 2 and 7 respectively revenue growth in each year was primarily the result of new client growth revenue growth in 2006 was lower than 2005 primarily due to a decrease in deposit levels resulting from strong equity markets which negatively impacted investment income and corresponding revenues operating margins in the investment segment were 18 in 2006 19 in 2005 and 16 in 2004 operating income and margin in 2006 were negatively impacted by the mix of revenue with a lower level of higher margin investment income as compared to 2005 the increase in operating income and margin in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to a temporary increase in cash investment balances in 2005 that improved net investment income 

discontinued operations 

on march 24 2005 we completed the sale of our securities clearing businesses to fidelity global brokerage group inc “fidelity” for 3449 million paid in cash at closing subject to certain postclosing adjustments prior to completion of the sale the securities clearing businesses paid a 680 million cash distribution to us the sales proceeds net of related expenses including taxes that became due upon the sale of the securities clearing businesses approximated the carrying value of this investment in 2005 we recorded a net loss on the sale of discontinued operations of 04 million net of related income taxes of 487 million the higher income tax expense on the sale of the securities clearing operations was primarily due to a significantly lower tax basis than book basis mainly due to a tax free exchange in our initial purchase of one of the companies that was sold during 2005 we recorded 003 per share in diluted earnings in discontinued operations primarily as a result of favorable resolutions of income tax uncertainties in 2006 we finalized and recognized a 106 million pretax gain related to a contingent payment that we received from fidelity based on the securities clearing businesses’ achievement of revenue targets established in the stock purchase agreement 

we are investigating a matter identified in an indemnification notice delivered pursuant to the stock purchase agreement the matter relates to the securities clearing businesses’ past maintenance of certain documentation related to introducing broker dealers’ customers we are unable to estimate or predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or to determine whether this matter will have a material adverse impact on the discontinued operations’ results 

interest expense and interest income 

interest expense was 410 million 278 million and 249 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the 132 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding due to acquisitions and additional share repurchases in 2005 and 2006 

interest income was 70 million 136 million and 67 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the 66 million decrease in interest income in 2006 and the 69 million increase in interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances in 2005 resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses 

  

realized gain from sale of investments 

in 2005 we realized a pretax gain of 435 million or 014 per share after income taxes from the sale of our remaining ownership of 32 million shares of common stock of bisys group inc in addition we sold our investment in intria items inc to our joint venture partner canadian imperial bank of commerce which resulted in a pretax gain of 434 million or 015 per share after income taxes 

income tax provision 

the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 376 in 2006 375 in 2005 and 384 in 2004 the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted by a number of onetime items compared to 2004 primarily associated with changes in state tax laws finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments we expect that the income tax rate for continuing operations will be 385 in 2007 

net income per sharediluted 

net income per sharediluted for 2006 was 253 compared to 270 in 2005 and 191 in 2004 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations was 250 in 2006 compared to 268 in 2005 and 200 in 2004 net income per sharediluted in 2006 compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a decrease of 029 per share from realized gains on sale of investments in 2005 approximately 012 per share from a decrease in contract termination fees in 2006 009 per share of incremental sharebased compensation expense in 2006 due to the prospective adoption of fas 123r on january 1 2006 and 003 per share related to the writedown of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division in 2006 net income per sharediluted from continuing operations for 2005 of 268 compared to 200 in 2004 was positively impacted by 029 per share due to the realized gain on sale of investments in 2005 and approximately 007 per share from an increase in contract termination fees in 2005 compared to 2004 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our free cash flow 

 

 free cash flow increased by 113 million in 2006 compared with 2005 and was impacted by a higher level of capital expenditures in 2006 capital expenditures increased 225 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to a series of investments to support future client growth free cash flow in 2006 was negatively impacted by lower contract termination fee revenue after income taxes of approximately 21 million and 112 million due to the treatment of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which are required by sfas 123r to be included in cash flows from financing activities instead of operating cash flows as they were in 2005 and prior years 

in 2006 we used our free cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program primarily to fund acquisition related payments of 1867 million and to repurchase 127 million shares of our common stock for 5601 million as of december 31 2006 04 million shares of our common stock were available for repurchase under previous authorizations by our board of directors on january 31 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million additional shares of our common stock share repurchases under the existing authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant shares repurchased have historically been held for issuance in connection with acquisitions and equity plans our current policy is to use our free cash flow to support future business opportunities and repurchase shares of our common stock rather than to pay dividends 

  

at december 31 2006 we had 7473 million of longterm debt of which 4518 million was outstanding under our revolving credit and commercial paper facilities we maintain a 500 million unsecured commercial paper program which is exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933 under this program we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance we also maintain a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks we may increase the availability under this facility up to 125 billion at our discretion subject to a number of conditions including the absence of any default under the credit agreement the revolving credit facility supports 100 of our outstanding commercial paper as a result borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants among other requirements our consolidated indebtedness is limited to no more than three and onehalf times consolidated net earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization the facility expires on march 24 2011 we were in compliance with all debt covenants throughout 2006 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to meet our operating requirements required operating lease payments required repayments of longterm debt and expected capital spending needs in 2007 at december 31 2006 we had 435 million available for borrowing under our credit and commercial paper facilities and 185 million of cash and cash equivalents in the event that we make significant future acquisitions we may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of common shares 

historically our growth has been accomplished to a significant degree through the acquisition of businesses that are complementary to our operations we believe that a number of acquisition candidates are available that would further enhance our competitive position and we plan to pursue them 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements other than operating leases purchase obligations primarily relate to agreements to purchase or license data processing equipment and software the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31 2006

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 

our investment support services subsidiaries accept money market account deposits from customers and invest those funds in marketable securities substantially all of the investments are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities our investment support services subsidiaries utilize simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities a formal asset liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks capital ratios liquidity levels portfolio diversification credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines at december 31 2006 mortgagebacked obligations have an average duration of approximately three years and eleven months with most of the remaining investments having a maturity of one year or less we do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps we use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount while changes in interest rates could decrease our interest income or increase our interest expense we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates based on our longterm debt with variable interest rates as of december 31 2006 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately 48 million based on our internal controls we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at december 31 2006 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2006 

 

 management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on management’s assessment our management believes that as of december 31 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting the report is included below under the heading “report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting” 

 

 there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of fiserv inc 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that fiserv inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

 item 1 business 

fiserv provides integrated information management systems and services to the financial and health benefits industries including transaction processing outsourcing business process outsourcing and software and systems solutions the company serves more than 17000 clients worldwide including banks credit unions financial planners and investment advisers insurance companies and agents selfinsured employers leasing companies lenders savings institutions and retailersmerchants the company operates centers in the united states for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related product businesses the company’s operations are principally domestic and in 2005 international operations constituted approximately 4 of total revenues through business support centers in argentina australia canada china colombia costa rica india indonesia the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

the company was formed in 1984 through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions historically these firms expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations as well as other financial institutions since its organization fiserv has grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring firms complementing the fiserv organization 

business strategy 

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions undergoes continuous change the financial industry introduces and implements new alternative lending investment deposit and payment products with great frequency the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking thrift and credit union organizations as well as by securities and insurance firms continue to narrow as traditionally different entities compete for the same ultimate customers with competitive services financial institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market pressures as well as under the auspices of regulatory agencies 

  

although such market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the united states consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole 

to stay competitive in this changing marketplace financial institutions are providing their customers with a broad variety of new products and services that are typically transactionoriented and feebased the growing volume and types of transactions accounts and payment mechanisms have increased the data processing and other service requirements of these institutions as a consequence fiserv believes that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of data processing products and services 

moreover fiserv expects that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources to the information systems requirements to require application of more specialized systems and to require development maintenance and enhancement of applications software fiserv believes that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

fiserv provides financial institutions with software to run operations internally or outsource services many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from a thirdparty or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities fiserv provides all of these options to the financial industry 

in 2001 fiserv expanded its scope of transaction processing from the financial industry to the health care industry with the primary focus on the processing of health claims for employers that selfinsure their health plans these services include claim adjudication and payment customer service reporting and other related services 

in the health care market as costs continue to rise health plan sponsors continue to seek to reduce costs managed care companies and traditional thirdparty administrators as well as many new niche specialty service providers have turned their focus to broad costcontainment and related consulting needs or have sought to meet specific problems related to prescription management health care administration or payment processing requirements these organizations seek to assist the health plan sponsors to reduce their total healthcare costs while making themselves more operationally efficient and by adding services to existing offerings that seek over a longer term to reduce ultimate costs and improve efficiencies fiserv has responded to the market demand for health care cost containment solutions by expanding its service offerings to include pharmacy benefits management care management and subrogation services in addition with its acquisition of caregain in january 2006 fiserv has expanded its offerings to include technology and service solutions for the administration of consumer directed health plans that feature health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts 

fiserv has implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products improving the cost effectiveness of services provided to clients aggressively soliciting new clients and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions in 2003 fiserv acquired 12 businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 610 million and approximately 3200 employees in 2004 fiserv acquired four businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 40 million and approximately 260 employees in 2005 fiserv acquired 8 businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 100 million and approximately 520 employees the following is a summary of acquisitions made by fiserv since its organization

fiserv regards its software as proprietary and utilizes a combination of trade secrecy laws internal security practices and employee nondisclosure agreements for protection the company believes that legal protection of its software while important is less significant than the knowledge and experience of the company’s management and personnel and their ability to develop enhance and market new products and services the company believes that it holds all proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of its business 

competition 

financial institution outsourcing systems and services the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive the company’s principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than the company competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions 

competitive factors for processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price the 

  

company believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories in addition the company believes that its position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage 

the company competes with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries including fidelity national information services inc metavante corporation jack henry and associates inc and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 

health plan management services the market for the company’s health plan administrative services is highly competitive the major competition for the company’s services comes from national and regional health insurance and managed care companies selling administrative services only many of the company’s competitors serve a larger number of customers with greater financial resources and proprietary products in addition the selfinsured health plan market is typically brokercontrolled highly price sensitive and frequently placed out for competitive bid significant competitors of the company include blue cross organizations unitedhealth group cigna and aetna 

investment support services several trust companies including sterling trust pensco ast trust company and reliance trust compete with the company in custody services for retirement account administration in the provision of services to financial advisors charles schwab  co and fidelity investments are the company’s most significant competitors 

government regulation 

the company’s data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions the company’s data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve bank the national credit union association the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review many of the company’s operations to provide internal control evaluations for its clients’ auditors and regulators 

the company’s subsidiaries operating as part of the company’s health plan management services segment are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight extends from annual reporting and licensing requirements imposed by most of the states in which these companies operate and continues on to extensive regulatory compliance requirements regarding daytoday operating policies and procedures for the various operating units in particular there have been increasing levels of regulation regarding privacy and security related to patients’ health care information at the federal level the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” governs the privacy and security of health information and imposes an extensive set of requirements on the company’s health plan management services group as well as its customers hipaa applies to a majority of the health plan management services group’s operations and requires these businesses to develop sophisticated compliance policies and procedures and contracts to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of health information many states have also adopted their own statutory rules for regulating the privacy and security of patient healthcare information and such state regulation is not generally preempted by the federal rules unless it is clearly inconsistent with the federal requirements in addition to state and federal regulation various customers require periodic audits of their health plan administrators to confirm compliance with standards of performance and these subsidiaries may be required to forfeit a portion of their fees if they fail to meet the required performance levels

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the risks described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before making an investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following risks develop into actual events our business financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations 

a major contributor to our growth in revenues and net income since our inception has been our ability to identify acquire and integrate similar or complementary businesses we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services we may not be able to 

  

identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future which could adversely affect our future growth businesses we acquire may perform worse than expected or be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected which could adversely affect our business and financial results we may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together in addition the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost basis we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business our contracts with our clients for core services generally run for a period of 35 years in our financial segment and provide for termination fees upon early termination renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other competitors or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards our future success 

  

will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers we may not be successful in developing marketing and selling new products and services that meet these changing demands in addition we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance we are continually engaged in significant efforts to upgrade our applications if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of our upgrade efforts it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry mergers or consolidations of financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may experience an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities which would harm our business and reputation 

an operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing facilities could cause us to lose clients damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could damage our relationship with certain clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment we have installed backup systems and procedures to prevent or reduce disruption a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients to choose service providers other than us 

our ability to compete in the health plan administration business requires us to arrange for network provider services with third parties over whom we have no control 

in order to provide administrative services to our clients who sponsor selfinsured health plans we must in most cases arrange for these clients to have access to a third party provider network in any particular market provider networks could refuse to contract with us or only do so on terms that would not allow us to compete with our competitors if these provider networks refuse to contract with us or only do so on terms that place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to compete or be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected in addition the large national health insurance carriers with whom we compete for administration services have their own proprietary networks which in some instances allow them to offer our target clients access to a health care network which offers better discounts rates than we have access to which may result in us being required to offer lower prices for administrative services in order to compete for such clients 

  

we may experience software defects development delays and installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations delay in market acceptance additional development and remediation costs diversion of technical and other resources loss of clients negative publicity or exposure to liability claims although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we have a long sales cycle for certain of our applications and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the implementation of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our clients particularly those with smaller operational scale potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale our sales cycle may be extended due to our clients’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or if we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our transaction processing businesses we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new clients 

if we fail to comply with regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions as a trust company or as an administrator of health services or if the national flood program is amended or substantially changed our businesses could be harmed 

our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities 

our health plan management services subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels covering licensing and other daytoday operating policies and 

  

procedures in addition most of the health plan management services businesses are subject to hipaa regulations that govern the privacy and security of health information to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of health information 

our trust subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the colorado division of banking 

if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level could have an adverse impact on us 

our flood processing services business is dependant on administration of the national flood program by the us government if there should be amendments with substantive changes to the national flood program there could be an adverse impact on our revenues or costs of doing business 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology we actively seek to protect our proprietary rights nevertheless unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

  

  

  

 third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future applications and services

 item 1 business 

  

fiserv provides integrated data processing and information management systems to more than 16000 financial services providers including banks credit unions financial planners and investment advisers insurance companies and agents selfinsured employers leasing companies lenders and savings institutions the company operates centers in the united states for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related product businesses the company’s operations are principally domestic and in 2004 international operations constituted approximately 3 of total processing and services revenues through business support centers in argentina australia canada colombia indonesia the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

  

the company was formed in 1984 through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions historically these firms expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations as well as other financial institutions since its organization fiserv has grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring firms complementing the fiserv organization 

  

business strategy 

  

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to undergo change the financial industry introduces and implements new alternative lending and investment products with great frequency the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking and thrift organizations as well as by securities and insurance firms continue to narrow as traditionally different entities compete for the same ultimate customers with competitive services financial institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market pressures as well as under the auspices of regulatory agencies 

  

although such market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the united states consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole 

  

to stay competitive in this changing marketplace financial institutions are providing their customers with a broad variety of new products and services that are typically transactionoriented and feebased the growing volume and types of transactions and accounts have increased the data processing requirements of these institutions as a consequence fiserv believes that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of data processing products and services 

  

moreover fiserv expects that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources to the information systems requirements to require application of more specialized systems and to require development maintenance and enhancement of applications software fiserv believes that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

  

fiserv provides financial institutions with software to run operations internally or to outsource services many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from a third party or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities fiserv provides all of these options to the financial industry 

  

in 2001 fiserv expanded its scope of transaction processing from the financial industry to the processing of health claims primarily for employers that selfinsure their health plans these services include claim adjudication and payment customer service reporting and other related services 

  

in the health care market as costs continue to rise health plan sponsors continue to seek to reduce costs managed care companies and traditional thirdparty administrators as well as many new niche specialty service providers have turned their focus to broad costcontainment and related consulting needs or have sought to meet specific problems related to prescription management health care administration or payment process requirements these organizations seek to assist the health plan sponsors to reduce their absolute costs to manage existing cost bases to make themselves more efficient by the services they currently provide or to add services to existing offerings that seek over a longer term to reduce ultimate costs or improve efficiencies 

  

fiserv has implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products improving the cost effectiveness of services provided to clients aggressively soliciting new clients and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions in 2002 fiserv acquired five businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 210 million and approximately 1100 employees in 2003 fiserv acquired 12 businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 610 million and approximately 3200 employees in 2004 fiserv acquired four businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 40 million and approximately 260 employees the following is a summary of acquisitions made by fiserv since its organization indicated by an asterisk are previously acquired businesses that are included in discontinued operations as a result of entry by fiserv clearing inc into a definitive sales agreement involving the proposed disposition of fiserv’s securities clearing businesses see “discontinued operations – securities clearing services” herein

competition 

  

financial institution outsourcing systems and services the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive the company’s principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than the company competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth of internal data centers 

  

competitive factors for processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price the company believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories in addition the company believes that its position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage 

  

we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries including the bisys group inc fidelity information services inc jack henry and associates inc metavante corporation and open solutions inc there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future

the company’s subsidiaries operating as part of the company’s health plan management services segment are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight extends from annual reporting and licensing requirements imposed by most of the states in which these companies operate and continues on to extensive regulatory compliance requirements regarding daytoday operating policies and procedures for the various operating units in particular there has been increasing levels of regulation regarding privacy and security related to patients’ health care information at the federal level the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” governs the privacy and security of health information and imposes an extensive set of requirements on the company’s health plan management services group as well as its customers hipaa applies to a majority of the health plan management services group’s operations and requires these businesses to develop sophisticated compliance policies and procedures and contracts to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of health information many states have also adopted their own statutory rules for regulating the privacy and security of patient healthcare information and such state regulation is not generally preempted by the federal rules unless it is clearly inconsistent with the federal requirements in addition to state and federal regulation various customers require periodic audits of their health plan administrators to confirm compliance with standards of performance and these subsidiaries may be required to forfeit a portion of their fees if they fail to meet the required performance levels

 item 1 business 

  

fiserv provides integrated data processing and information management systems to more than 15000 financial services providers including banks brokerdealers credit unions financial planners and investment advisers insurance companies and agents selfinsured employers leasing companies mortgage lenders and savings institutions the company operates centers in the united states for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related product businesses the company’s operations are principally domestic and in 2003 international operations constituted approximately 4 of total processing and services revenues through business support centers in argentina australia canada colombia indonesia the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

  

the company was formed in 1984 through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions historically these firms expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations as well as other financial institutions since its organization fiserv has grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring firms complementing the fiserv organization 

  

business strategy 

  

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to undergo change the financial industry introduces and implements new alternative lending and investment products with great frequency the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking and thrift organizations as well as by securities and insurance firms continue to narrow as traditionally different entities compete for the same ultimate customers with competitive services financial institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market pressures as well as under the auspices of regulatory agencies 

  

although such market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the united states consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole new organizations entering the once limited financial services industry have opened new markets for fiserv services 

  

to stay competitive in this changing marketplace financial institutions are providing their customers a broad variety of new products and services that are typically transactionoriented and feebased the growing volume and types of transactions and accounts have increased the data processing requirements of these institutions as a consequence fiserv believes that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of data processing products and services 

  

moreover fiserv expects that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources to the information systems requirements to require application of more specialized systems and to require development maintenance and enhancement of applications software fiserv believes that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

  

in response to these market dynamics financial institutions obtain data processing services by different means than in the past many smaller local and regional thirdparty data processors are leaving the business or consolidating with larger providers a number of large financial institutions previously providing thirdparty processing services for other institutions have withdrawn from the business to concentrate on their primary core businesses similarly an increasing number of financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from a third party or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities fiserv provides all of these options to the financial industry 

  

to capitalize on these industry trends fiserv has implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products improving the cost effectiveness of services provided to clients aggressively soliciting new clients and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions in 2001 fiserv acquired 12 businesses adding combined annual revenues of more than 380 million and approximately 4000 new employees in 2002 fiserv acquired five businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 210 million and approximately 1100 employees in 2003 fiserv acquired 12 businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 610 million and approximately 3200 employees the following is a summary of acquisitions made by fiserv since its organization

competition 

  

financial institution outsourcing systems and services the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive the company’s principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than the company competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth of internal data centers 

  

competitive factors for processing services include product quality service reliability product line comprehensiveness and integration timely introduction of new products and features and price the company believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories in addition the company believes that its position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage 

  

we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries including aurum technologies inc the bisys group inc fidelity information services inc jack henry and associates inc and metavante corporation there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future

securities processing and trust services the company competes with several larger companies in the securities clearing business specifically the bank of new york fleetboston financial corporation fidelity investments bear stearns  co and others provide competitive services to those of the company many of these competitors are engaged as well in the retail brokerage business and thus have a captive supply of clearing business that the company does not have 

  

in the trust services area several trust companies the most notable of which is delaware charter compete with the company in custody services for selfdirected retirement accounts in the provision of services to financial advisors and the mutual fund trading area charles schwab  co which handles a much larger volume of such trades is the company’s most significant competitor

 item 1 business 

  

fiserv is a leading provider of integrated data processing and information management systems to the financial industry the company was formed in 1984 through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions historically these firms expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations as well as other financial institutions since its organization fiserv has grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements adding new clients and acquiring firms complementing the fiserv organization 

  

as a leading technology resource fiserv serves more than 13000 financial services providers worldwide including banks brokerdealers credit unions financial planners and investment advisers insurance companies and agents leasing companies mortgage lenders and savings institutions the company operates centers nationwide for fullservice financial data processing software system development item processing and check imaging technology support and related product businesses in addition the company has business support centers in argentina australia canada colombia indonesia the philippines puerto rico poland singapore and the united kingdom 

  

business strategy 

  

the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to undergo change the financial industry is introducing and implementing new alternative lending and investment products with great frequency the distinctions among financial services traditionally offered by banking and thrift organizations as well as by securities and insurance firms continue to narrow financial institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market pressures as well as under the auspices of regulatory agencies 

  

although such market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the united states consolidation has not resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole new organizations entering the once limited financial services industry have opened new markets for fiserv services 

  

to stay competitive in this changing marketplace financial institutions are providing their customers a broad variety of new products and services that are typically transactionoriented and fee 

  

based the growing volume and types of transactions and accounts have increased the data processing requirements of these institutions as a consequence fiserv believes that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of data processing products and services 

  

moreover fiserv expects that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources to the information systems requirements to require application of more specialized systems and to require development maintenance and enhancement of applications software fiserv believes that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources 

  

in response to these market dynamics financial institutions obtain data processing services by different means than in the past many smaller local and regional thirdparty data processors are leaving the business or consolidating with larger providers a number of large financial institutions previously providing thirdparty processing services for other institutions have withdrawn from the business to concentrate on their primary core businesses similarly an increasing number of financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from a third party or by contracting with thirdparty processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services outsourcing can involve the licensing of software which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution or the utilization of service bureaus facilities management or resource management capabilities fiserv provides all of these options to the financial industry 

  

to capitalize on these industry trends fiserv has implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products improving the cost effectiveness of services provided to clients aggressively soliciting new clients and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions in 2001 fiserv acquired 12 businesses adding combined annual revenues of more than 380 million and approximately 4000 new employees in 2002 fiserv acquired five businesses with combined annual revenues of more than 210 million and approximately 1100 employees the following is a summary of acquisitions made by fiserv since its organization

competition 

  

the market for information technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive the company’s principal competitors include internal data processing departments data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers independent computer service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than the company competition for inhouse data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth of internal data centers 

  

competitive factors for processing services include product quality reliability of service comprehensiveness and integration of product lines timely introduction of new products and features and price the company believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories in addition the company believes that its position as an independent vendor rather than as a cooperative an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor is a competitive advantage
